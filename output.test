and services ; Â • Â   consumer and business travel services ; Â • Â   stored value products such as travelers cheques and other prepaid products ; Â • Â   network services ; Â • Â   merchant

analyses and related consulting services , fraud prevention services , and the design of customized customer loyalty and rewards programs . the company Â ’ s products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups , including consumers , small businesses , mid-sized companies and large corporations . these products and services are sold through various channels , including direct mail , online applications , targeted direct and third-party sales forces , and direct response advertising . the company recently created the enterprise growth group , which focuses on generating alternative sources of revenue on a global basis , both organically and through acquisitions , in areas such as online and mobile payments and fee-based services . the company Â ’ s products and services generate the following types of revenue for the company : Â • Â   discount revenue , which is the company Â ’ s largest revenue source , represents fees charged to merchants when cardmembers use their cards to purchase goods and services on the company Â ’ s network ; Â • Â   net card fees , which represent revenue earned for annual charge card memberships ; Â • Â   travel commissions and fees , which are earned by charging a transaction or management fee for airline or other travel-related transactions ; Â • Â   other commissions and fees , which are earned on foreign exchange conversions and card-related fees and assessments ; Â • Â   other revenue , which represents insurance premiums earned from cardmember travel and other insurance programs , revenues arising from contracts with global network services Â ’ ( gns ) partners ( including royalties and signing fees ) , publishing revenues and other miscellaneous revenue and fees ; and Â • Â   interest and fees on loans , which principally represents interest income earned on outstanding balances , and card fees related to the cardmember loans portfolio . in addition to funding and operating costs associated with these types of revenue , other major expense categories are related to marketing and reward programs that add new cardmembers and promote cardmember loyalty and spending , and provisions for anticipated cardmember credit and fraud losses . table of contents financial targetsthe company will seek to achieve three financial targets , on average and over time : Â • Â   revenues net of interest expense growth of at least 8 Â   percent ; Â • Â   earnings per share ( eps ) Â   growth of 12 to 15 Â   percent ; and Â • Â   return on average equity ( roe ) Â   of 25 Â   percent or more . if the company achieves its eps target as well as the roe target , it would seek to return , on average and over time , approximately 50 Â   percent of the capital it generates to shareholders as a dividend or through the repurchase of common stock . forward-looking statements and non-gaap measurescertain of the statements in this form 10-q are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 . refer to the Â “ forward-looking statements Â ” section below . in addition , certain calculations included within this form 10-q constitute non-gaap financial measures . the company Â ’ s calculations of non-gaap financial measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies . bank holding companythe company is a bank holding company under the bank holding company act of 1956 and the federal reserve board ( federal reserve ) is the company Â ’ s primary federal regulator . as such , the company is subject to the federal reserve Â ’ s regulations , policies and minimum capital standards . current business environment / outlookthe company Â ’ s results for the second quarter of 2011 continued to reflect strong spending growth and improved credit performance . during the quarter cardmember spending volumes grew both in the united states and internationally , and across all of the company Â ’ s businesses . while the positive impacts of stronger billings growth and modestly higher borrowing levels were partially offset by lower loan yields , the strong billings growth , improved credit trends and the benefit of a lower effective tax rate provided the company with the opportunity to invest in the business at significant levels and also generate strong earnings . these investments continue to be focused both on driving near-term metrics and building capabilities that will benefit the medium to long-term success of the company . the company also continued to invest in its rewards programs . during the second quarter rewards costs rose significantly , reflecting greater rewards-related spending volumes and higher co-brand expense . in addition , higher cardmember redemptions led to an increase in the ultimate redemption rate , while a shift in redemption mix also drove an increase in the weighted average cost per point . these increases in the ultimate redemption rate and weighted average cost per point , both of which impacted the expense related to points earned during the quarter as well as the membership rewards liability for unredeemed points at the beginning of the quarter , led to a more pronounced increase in rewards costs during this quarter than in previous quarters . the company Â ’ s improving credit trends mentioned above contributed to a reduction in loan write-offs and in loss reserve levels over the course of the second quarter of 2011 when compared to 2010 . despite a reduction of approximately $ 400 Â   million in loss reserve levels during the quarter , reserve coverage ratios remain at appropriate levels . going forward , the company expects benefits to its results from reserve releases to diminish . table of contents net interest yield declined compared to the second quarter of 2010 . the lower yield reflects lower revolving levels and lower balances at penalty rates due to the implementation of elements of the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 ( the Â “ card act Â ” ) , which were partially offset by the benefit of certain repricing initiatives effective during 2009 and 2010 . going forward , yield will continue to be influenced by certain strategies the company decides to employ , such as its current focus on premium lending , as well as other factors such as the credit quality of its portfolio , the percentage of the portfolio that is revolving , the cost of funds and potential pricing changes . despite the continued momentum across the company Â ’ s businesses , the economic and regulatory environment remains uncertain . the uncertain environment includes questions about the creditworthiness of sovereign issuers within europe and the ongoing possibility of a credit downgrade of u . s . government-issued securities . sovereign defaults or credit downgrades could lead to disruptions in the money markets , changes in the foreign exchange value of the euro or the u . s . dollar , or both , reduce the attractiveness and value of u . s . and european assets , or increase borrowing costs for consumers and companies in europe and the united states . in addition , the company received the last settlement payment from mastercard in the second quarter , will receive the last payment from visa in the fourth quarter and faces more difficult year-over-year comparisons in light of strong 2010 volume and credit performance . in light of these factors , the company is continuing to implement its plan to slow the growth of its operating expenses as it exits this year and enters 2012 . reengineering initiativesduring 2011 , the company expects to record restructuring charges related to employee severance obligations , other employee-related costs and lease termination costs resulting from the planned consolidation of facilities within the company Â ’ s global servicing network , which was first announced in the fourth quarter of 2010 . the expected aggregate amount of $ 60 Â   million to $ 80 million pretax ( approximately $ 38 Â   million to $ 51 Â   million after-tax ) is expected to include approximately $ 25 Â   million to $ 35 Â   million in costs associated with additional employee compensation and approximately $ 35 Â   million to $ 45 Â   million in other costs principally relating to the termination of certain real property leases . during the first and second quarter , respectively , the company has recorded $ 11 Â   million ( $ 7 Â   million after-tax ) and $ 4 Â   million ( $ 2 Â   million after-tax ) of such additional charges . substantially all of the reengineering activities are expected to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of 2011 . in the second quarter of 2011 , the company recorded $ 44 Â   million ( $ 34 Â   million after-tax ) of additional severance related reengineering costs unrelated to the global servicing initiatives described above . acquisitionsduring the first quarter of 2011 , the company completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in loyalty partner ( march Â   1 , 2011 ) for total consideration of $ 616 Â   million ( $ 585 Â   million plus $ 31 million in cash acquired ) . in addition , the company may acquire the remaining noncontrolling equity interest over the next five years at a price based on business performance , which currently has an estimated fair value of $ 150 Â   million . loyalty partner is a leading marketing services company best known for the loyalty programs it operates in germany , poland and india . loyalty partner also provides market analysis , operating platforms and consulting services that help merchants grow their businesses . the final purchase price allocation will be completed in a subsequent quarter . refer to note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for further information . table of contents american express companyrefer to Â “ glossary of selected terminology Â ” for

Â   ( b ) Â   average basic cardmember spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only . average fee per card is computed based on net card fees , including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs , plus card fees included in interest and fees on loans ( including related amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs ) , divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force . the card fees related to cardmember loans included in interest and fees on loans were $ 68 Â   million and $ 48 Â   million for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively , and $ 132 Â   million and $ 99 Â   million for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively . the adjusted average fee per card , which is a non-gaap measure , is computed in the same manner , but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs ( a portion of which is charge card related and included in net card fees and a portion of which is lending related and included in interest and fees on loans ) . the amount of amortization excluded was $ 56 Â   million for both the three months ended june Â   30 , 2011 and 2010 , and $ 110 Â   million and $ 107 Â   million for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively . the company presents adjusted average fee per card because the company believes this metric presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of its proprietary card products . table of contents american express company Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â

Â   ( b ) Â   the company presents a net write-off rate based on principal losses only ( i . e . , excluding interest and / or fees ) to be consistent with industry convention . in addition , because the company Â ’ s practice is to include uncollectible interest and / or fees as part of its total provision for losses , a net write-off rate including principal , interest and / or fees is also presented . Â   ( c ) Â   effective january Â   1 , 2010 , the company revised the time period in which past due cardmember receivables in international card services and global commercial services are written off to when they are 180 Â   days past due or earlier , consistent with applicable bank regulatory guidance and the write-off methodology adopted for u . s . card services in the fourth quarter of 2008 . previously , receivables were written off when they were 360 Â   days past billing or earlier . therefore , the net write-offs for the first quarter of 2010 include net write-offs of approximately $ 60 Â   million for international card services and approximately $ 48 Â   million for global commercial services resulting from this write-off methodology change , which increased the net loss ratios and decreased the 90 Â   days past billing metrics for these segments , but did not have a substantial impact on provisions for losses . Â   ( d ) Â   in accordance with gaap governing accounting for consolidation of variable interest entities ( vie ) Â   effective january Â   1 , 2010 , which resulted in the consolidation of the american express credit account master trust ( the lending trust ) , $ 29 . 0 Â   billion of additional cardmember loans along with a $ 2 . 5 Â   billion loan loss reserve were recorded on the company Â ’ s balance sheets . table of contents ( e ) Â   see below for calculations of net interest yield on cardmember loans , a non-gaap measure , and net interest income divided by average loans , a gaap measure . the company believes net interest yield on cardmember loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of the company Â ’ s cardmember loan portfolio . Â   ( f ) Â   this calculation includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the cardmember loan portfolio , and thus is not representative of net interest yield on cardmember loans . the calculation includes interest income and interest expense attributable to investment securities and other interest-bearing deposits as well as to cardmember loans , and interest expense attributable to other activities , including cardmember receivables . american express companycalculation of net interest yield on cardmember loans Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â

consolidated results of operations and consolidated liquidity and capital resources are presented on a basis consistent with gaap unless otherwise noted . beginning the first quarter of 2011 , certain payments to business partners previously expensed in other , net expense have been reclassified as contra-revenue within discount revenue or as marketing and promotion expense . these partner payments are primarily related to certain co-brand contracts where upfront payments are amortized over the life of the contract . amounts in prior periods for this item and certain other amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation and are insignificant to the affected line items . consolidated results of operations for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2011 and 2010the company Â ’ s consolidated net income for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2011 increased $ 314 million or 31 Â   percent to $ 1 . 3 Â   billion and diluted eps , including discontinued operations , increased by $ 0 . 26 to $ 1 . 10 . the company Â ’ s total revenues net of interest expense and total expenses increased by approximately 12 Â   percent and 21 Â   percent , respectively , while total provisions for losses decreased by 45 Â   percent for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2011 , as compared to the same period in the prior year . assuming no changes in foreign currency exchange rates from 2010 to 2011 , total revenues net of interest expense and total expenses increased approximately 8 Â   percent and 17 Â   percent , respectively , while provisions for losses decreased approximately 46 Â   percent in 20111 Â   1 Â   the foreign currency adjusted information , a non-gaap measure , assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into u . s . dollars ( i . e . , assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2011 apply to the period against which such results are being compared ) . the company believes the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare the company Â ’ s performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates . table of contents total revenues net of interest expenseconsolidated total revenues net of interest expense for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2011 of $ 7 . 6 Â   billion were up $ 813 Â   million or 12 Â   percent from 2010 . the increase in total revenues net of interest expense primarily reflects higher discount revenues , greater travel commissions and fees , increased other commissions and fees , higher other revenue and higher net card fees , partially offset by lower net interest income . discount revenue for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2011 increased $ 598 Â   million or 16 Â   percent as compared to 2010 to $ 4 . 3 Â   billion as a result of 18 Â   percent growth in billed business volumes , partially offset by a slight decline in the average discount rate . the lower revenue growth versus total billed business growth reflects the relatively faster growth in billed business related to gns , where the company shares the discount revenue with card issuing partners , and higher contra-revenue items , including corporate incentive payments and partner payments . the average discount rate was 2 . 54 Â   percent and 2 . 56 Â   percent for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively . u . s . billed business and billed business outside the united states were up 14 Â   percent and 27 percent , respectively , for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2011 as compared to the same period in the prior year . the increase in billed business within the united states reflected an increase in average spending per proprietary basic card and a slight increase in basic cards-in-force . the increase in billed business outside the united states reflected an increase in average spending per proprietary basic card and basic cards-in-force . the table below summarizes selected statistics for billed business and average spend during the three months ended june Â   30 , 2011 compared to the same period in the prior year : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   2011 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â

increased $ 89 Â   million or 21 Â   percent to $ 523 Â   million , primarily reflecting a 17 Â   percent increase in worldwide travel sales and a slight increase in the sales commission rate . other commissions and fees increased $ 87 Â   million or 18 Â   percent to $ 584 Â   million , primarily driven by revenues related to loyalty partner operations . other revenues increased $ 51 Â   million or 10 Â   percent to $ 537 Â   million , primarily reflecting higher gns partner royalty revenues , higher foreign exchange fees , higher global prepaid revenues and greater merchant-related fee revenues . interest income decreased $ 70 Â   million or 4 Â   percent to $ 1 . 7 Â   billion for the three months ended june 30 , 2011 compared to the same period in the prior year . interest and fees on loans decreased 3 percent , driven by a lower yield , which was partially offset by a 2 Â   percent increase in average cardmember loans . the lower net yield reflects lower revolving levels

billion , up $ 938 Â   million or 21 Â   percent from $ 4 . 6 Â   billion in 2010 . the increase reflects increased cardmember rewards expenses , higher salaries and employee benefits expenses , greater professional services expenses and cardmember services expenses , partially offset by lower marketing and promotion expenses . marketing and promotion expenses decreased $ 29 Â   million or 4 Â   percent to $ 795 Â   million for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2011 from $ 824 Â   million in 2010 due to lower uscs product media spending , partially offset by higher international investments . table of contents cardmember rewards expenses increased $ 421 Â   million or 35 Â   percent to $ 1 . 6 Â   billion in 2011 from $ 1 . 2 billion in 2010 , reflecting greater rewards-related spending volumes and higher co-brand expense . in addition , higher redemption rates led to an increase in the ultimate redemption rate , while a shift in redemption mix also drove an increase in the weighted average cost per point . these increases in the ultimate redemption rate and weighted average cost per point , both of which impacted the expense related to points earned during the quarter as well as the membership rewards liability for unredeemed points at the beginning of the quarter , led to a more pronounced increase in rewards costs during this quarter than in previous quarters . refer to Â “ critical accounting policies Â ” in the company Â ’ s 2010 annual report to shareholders for further discussion of its accounting policy for reserves for membership rewards costs . cardmember services expense increased $ 46 Â   million or 36 Â   percent to $ 173 Â   million reflecting increased costs associated with new benefits made available to u . s . cardmembers . salaries and employee benefits expenses increased $ 280 Â   million or 21 Â   percent to $ 1 . 6 Â   billion for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2011 from $ 1 . 3 Â   billion in

compared to the same period in 2010 , primarily reflecting a smaller benefit related to accounting for hedging the company Â ’ s fixed-rate debt in the second quarter of 2011 versus the prior year as well as a prior year foreign exchange translation gain . income taxesthe effective tax rate from continuing operations was 27 Â   percent for the three months ended june 30 , 2011 compared to 36 Â   percent for the same period in 2010 . the tax rates in both periods reflect the level of pretax income in relation to recurring permanent tax benefits . in addition , the tax rate in the second quarter of 2011 includes the impact of a $ 102 Â   million tax benefit related to the favorable resolution of certain prior years Â ’ tax items while the tax rate in 2010 includes the impact of a $ 44

percent and 20 Â   percent , respectively , while total provisions for losses decreased by 72 Â   percent for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2011 as compared to the same period in the prior year . assuming no changes in foreign currency exchange rates from 2010 to 2011 , total revenues net of interest expense and total expenses increased approximately 7 Â   percent and 17 Â   percent , respectively2 Â   2 Â   the foreign currency adjusted information , a non-gaap measure , assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into u

the company believes the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare the company Â ’ s performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates . table of contents total revenues net of interest expenseconsolidated total revenues net of interest expense for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2011 of $ 14 . 6 billion were up $ 1 . 3 Â   billion or 10 Â   percent from 2010 . the increase in total revenues net of interest expense primarily reflects higher discount revenues , greater travel commissions and fees , increased other commissions and fees , higher other revenue and higher net card fees , partially offset by lower net interest income . discount revenue for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2011 increased $ 1 . 1 Â   billion or 15 Â   percent as compared to 2010 to $ 8 . 2 Â   billion as a result of an 18 Â   percent increase in

$ 202 million or 6 Â   percent to $ 3 . 2 Â   billion , driven by a lower yield on cardmember loans , partially offset by an increase in average cardmember loans . the lower net yield reflects lower revolving levels and lower balances at penalty rates due to the implementation of elements of the card act and improved credit performance . these reductions to yield were partially offset by the benefit of certain repricing initiatives effective during 2009 and 2010 . interest and dividends on investment securities decreased $ 55 Â   million or 23 Â   percent to $ 187 Â   million , primarily reflecting decreased average investment levels , partially offset by higher investment yields . interest on deposits with banks and others increased $ 9 Â   million or 31 Â   percent to $ 38 Â

during the first six months of 2011 . cardmember rewards expenses increased $ 787 Â   million or 33 Â   percent to $ 3 . 2 Â   billion in 2011 from $ 2 . 4 billion in 2010 , reflecting higher rewards-related spending volumes and co-brand expense . in addition , higher redemption rates led to an increase in the ultimate redemption rate ; to a lesser extent , a shift in redemption mix also drove an increase in the weighted average cost per point . these increases in the ultimate redemption rate and weighted average cost per point , both of which impacted the expense related to points earned during the period as well as the membership rewards liability for unredeemed points at the beginning of the period , led to a more pronounced increase in rewards costs during this period than

expenses for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2011 increased $ 171 Â   million compared to the same period in 2010 , primarily reflecting a loss on foreign exchange translation in the six months ended june Â   30 , 2011 versus a gain on similar translation in the prior year , as well as a smaller benefit related to accounting for hedging the company Â ’ s fixed-rate debt compared to the prior year , higher taxes other than income and higher travel and entertainment costs . income taxesthe effective tax rate from continuing operations was 29 Â   percent for the six months ended june Â   30

rate for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2011 includes the impact of a $ 102 Â   million tax benefit related to the favorable resolution of certain prior years Â ’ tax items while the tax rate in 2010 included the impact of a $ 44 Â   million valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets associated with certain of the company Â ’ s non-u . s . travel operations . table of contents consolidated capital resources and liquiditythe company Â ’ s balance sheet management objectives are to maintain : Â • Â   a solid and flexible equity capital profile ; Â • Â   a broad , deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance its assets and meet operating requirements ; and Â • Â   liquidity programs that enable the company to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements , even in the event it is unable to raise new funds under its regular funding programs . capital strategythe company Â ’ s objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through earnings and other sources to maintain a solid equity capital base and to provide flexibility to satisfy future business growth . the company believes capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk-adjusted equity in excess of its costs will generate shareholder value . the level and composition of the company Â ’ s consolidated capital position are determined through the company Â ’ s internal capital adequacy assessment process ( icaap ) , which reflects its business activities , as well as marketplace conditions and credit rating agency requirements . they are also influenced by subsidiary capital requirements . the company , as a bank holding company , is also subject to regulatory requirements administered by the u . s . federal banking agencies . the federal reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets , liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items . the company currently calculates and reports its capital ratios under the measurement standards commonly referred to as basel i . in june Â   2004 , the basel committee on banking supervision ( commonly referred to as basel ) published new international guidelines for determining regulatory capital ( basel ii ) . in december Â   2007 , the u . s . bank regulatory agencies jointly adopted a final rule based on basel ii . the company has adopted basel ii in certain non-u . s . jurisdictions and is currently taking steps towards basel ii implementation in the u . s . the dodd-frank reform act and a series of international capital and liquidity standards known as basel iii published by basel on december Â   16 , 2010 will in the future change these current quantitative measures . in general , these changes will involve , for the u . s . banking industry as a whole , a reduction in the types of instruments deemed to be capital along with an increase in the amount of capital that assets , liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items require . these changes will generally serve to reduce reported capital ratios compared to current capital guidelines . the specific u . s . guidelines supporting the new standards and the basel iii capital standards have not been finalized , but are generally expected to be issued before this year-end . in addition to these measurement changes , international and u . s . banking regulators could increase the ratio levels at which banks would be deemed to be Â “ well capitalized Â ” . table of contents the following table presents the regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio for the company and its significant bank subsidiaries , as well as additional ratios widely utilized in the marketplace , as of june Â   30 , 2011 . as noted below , certain of these ratios are based on shareholders Â ’ equity of $ 18 . 2 Â   billion as of june Â   30 , 2011 .

will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital than prior requirements , with a greater emphasis on common equity . while final implementation of the rules related to capital ratios will be determined by the federal reserve , the company estimates that had the new rules been in place during the second quarter of 2011 , the reported tier 1 risk-based capital and tier 1 common risk-based ratios would decline by approximately 40 basis points . in addition , the impact of the new rules on the reported tier 1 leverage ratio would be a decline of approximately 160 basis points . the estimated impact of the basel iii rules will change over time based upon changes in the size and composition of the company Â ’ s balance sheet as well as based on the u . s . implementation of the basel iii rules . the following provides definitions for the company Â ’ s regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio , all of which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance : risk-weighted assets tier 1 risk-based capital ratio table of contents total risk-based capital ratio tier 1 leverage ratio the following provides definitions for capital ratios widely used in the marketplace , although they may be calculated differently by different companies : tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio Â — Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â

$ 14 , 150 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   the company believes the tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio may be useful because it can be used to assess and compare the quality and composition of the company Â ’ s capital with the capital of other financial services companies . moreover , the proposed international banking capital standards known as basel iii include measures that rely on the tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio . common equity and tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets ratios the company seeks to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements ; failure to maintain minimum capital levels could affect the company Â ’ s status as a financial holding company and cause the respective regulatory agencies to take actions that could limit the company Â ’ s business operations . the company Â ’ s primary source of equity capital has been through the generation of net income . historically , capital generated through net income and other sources , such as the exercise of stock options by employees , has exceeded the growth in its capital requirements . to the extent capital has exceeded business , regulatory and rating agency requirements , the company has returned excess capital to shareholders through its regular common share dividend and share repurchase program . table of contents the company maintains certain flexibility to shift capital across its businesses as appropriate . for example , the company may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements . these infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels for american express Â ’ parent company ( parent company ) . share repurchases and dividendsthe company has a share repurchase program to return excess capital to shareholders . these share repurchases reduce shares outstanding and offset , in whole or part , the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans . during the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2011 , the company returned $ 966 Â   million and $ 1 . 2 billion , respectively , in dividends and share repurchases , which represents approximately 61 percent and 40 Â   percent of total capital generated . during the second quarter of 2011 , the company commenced share repurchase activities and repurchased 15 Â   million common shares at an average price of $ 50 . 14 . on january Â   7 , 2011 , the company submitted its comprehensive capital plan ( ccp ) Â   to the federal reserve requesting approval to proceed with additional share repurchases in 2011 . the ccp included an analysis of performance and capital availability under certain adverse economic assumptions , as well as a capital distribution plan outlining the company Â ’ s plans to return capital to shareholders in 2011 through dividends and share repurchases . on march Â   18 , 2011 , the company was informed that the federal reserve had no objections to the company Â ’ s 2011 capital distribution plan . the total number of shares repurchased in 2011 will be based on the company Â ’ s business plans and financial performance , and will be consistent with its submitted capital distribution plan . since the inception of repurchase programs in december Â   1994 , 699 Â   million shares have been acquired under cumulative board authorizations to repurchase up to 770 Â   million shares . on a cumulative basis , since 1994 , the company has distributed 63 Â   percent of capital generated through share repurchases and dividends . as discussed above , the objective is to return to shareholders , on average and over time , approximately 50 Â   percent of the capital the company generates through a combination of dividends and the repurchase of common shares . funding strategythe company Â ’ s principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well-diversified funding sources to allow it to meet its maturing obligations , cost-effectively finance current and future asset growth in its global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile . the diversity of funding sources by type of debt instrument , by maturity and by investor base , among other factors , provides additional insulation from the impact of disruptions in any one type of debt , maturity or investor . the mix of the company Â ’ s funding in any period will seek to achieve cost-efficiency consistent with both maintaining diversified sources and achieving its liquidity objectives . the company Â ’ s funding strategy and activities are integrated into its asset-liability management activities . the company has in place a funding policy covering american express company and all of its subsidiaries . the company Â ’ s proprietary card businesses are the primary asset-generating businesses , with significant assets in both domestic and international cardmember receivable and lending activities . the company Â ’ s financing needs are in large part a consequence of its proprietary card-issuing businesses and the maintenance of a liquidity position to support all of its business activities , such as merchant payments . the company generally pays merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by cardmembers and therefore funds the merchant payments during the period cardmember loans and receivables are outstanding . the company also has additional financing needs associated with general corporate purposes , including acquisition activities . table of contents the company seeks to raise funds to meet all of its financing needs , including seasonal and other working capital needs , while also seeking to maintain sufficient cash and readily-marketable securities that are easily convertible to cash , in order to meet the scheduled maturities of all long-term borrowings on a consolidated basis for a 12-month period . management does not expect to make any major funding or liquidity strategy changes in order to meet basel iii Â ’ s liquidity coverage ratio ( lcr ) Â   standard . during the second quarter of 2011 , the company issued c $ 325 Â   million of senior unsecured debt with a maturity of three years and a floating rate of 1-month canadian dealer offered rate ( cdor ) Â   plus 105 basis points , c $ 400 Â   million of senior unsecured debt with a maturity of five years and a coupon of 3 . 6 Â   percent and $ 600 Â   million of senior unsecured debt with a maturity of three years and a floating rate of 3-month libor plus 85 basis points . the company Â ’ s funding plan for the full year 2011 includes , among other sources , approximately $ 3 Â   billion to $ 7 Â   billion of unsecured term debt issuance and zero to $ 3 Â   billion of secured term debt issuance . the company Â ’ s funding plans are subject to various risks and uncertainties , such as future business growth , the impact of global economic , political and other events on market capacity , demand for securities offered by the company , regulatory changes , ability to securitize and sell receivables , and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions . many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond the company Â ’ s control . the company Â ’ s equity capital and funding strategies are designed , among other things , to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies , moody Â ’ s investor services ( moody Â ’ s ) , standard & poor Â ’ s ( s & p ) , fitch ratings ( fitch ) and dominion bond rating services ( dbrs ) . such ratings help to support the company Â ’ s access to cost-effective unsecured funding as part of its overall financing programs . ratings for the company Â ’ s asset-backed securitization ( abs ) Â   activities are evaluated separately . unsecured debt ratings Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   short-term Â   long-term

from Â “ negative Â ” to Â “ stable Â ” . downgrades in the company Â ’ s unsecured debt or asset securitization program Â ’ s securities ratings could result in higher interest expense on the company Â ’ s unsecured debt and asset securitizations , as well as higher fees related to borrowings under its unused lines of credit . in addition to increased funding costs , declines in credit ratings could reduce the company Â ’ s borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets . the company believes the change in its funding mix , which now includes an increasing proportion of fdic-insured ( as defined below ) u . s . retail deposits , should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on the company Â ’ s funding capacity and costs . however , downgrades to certain of the company Â ’ s unsecured debt ratings that have occurred over the last several years have not caused a permanent increase in the company Â ’ s borrowing costs or a reduction in its borrowing capacity . table of contents deposit programsthe company offers deposits within its american express centurion bank and american express bank , fsb subsidiaries ( together , the banks ) . these funds are currently insured up to $ 250 , 000 per account through the federal deposit insurance corporation ( fdic ) . the company Â ’ s ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on the banks Â ’ capital levels . the company , through fsb , has a direct deposit-taking program , personal savings from american express , to supplement its distribution of deposit products through third-party distribution channels . this program makes fdic-insured certificates of deposit ( cds ) and high-yield savings account products available directly to consumers . during the second quarter of 2011 , within u . s . retail deposits the company focused on continuing to grow both the number of accounts and the total balances outstanding on savings accounts and cds that were sourced directly with consumers through personal savings from american express . the account and balance growth of personal savings from american express financed the maturities of cds issued through third-party distribution channels . the company held the following deposits as of : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   june 30 , Â   Â   december 31 , ( billions ) Â   2011 Â   Â   2010u . s . retail deposits : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   savings accounts Â — direct Â   $ 13 . 0 Â   Â   $ 7 . 7certificates of deposit : ( a )

at issuance on the total portfolio of u . s . retail cds , issued through direct and third-party programs , were 20 . 0 months and 2 . 6 Â   percent , respectively . asset securitization programsthe company periodically securitizes cardmember receivables and loans arising from its card business , as the securitization market provides the company with cost-effective funding . securitization of cardmember receivables and loans is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust , which in turn issues certificates or notes ( securities ) Â   collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors . the proceeds from issuance are distributed to the company , through its wholly owned subsidiaries , as consideration for the transferred assets . the receivables and loans being securitized are reported as owned assets on the company Â ’ s consolidated balance sheets and the related securities issued to third-party investors are reported as long-term debt . under the respective terms of the securitization trust agreements , the occurrence of certain triggering events could result in payment of trust expenses , establishment of reserve funds , or in a worst-case scenario , early amortization of investor certificates . during the six months ended june Â   30 , 2011 , no triggering events have occurred resulting in funding of reserve accounts or early amortization . the ability of issuers of asset-backed securities to obtain necessary credit ratings for their issuances has historically been based , in part , on qualification under the fdic Â ’ s safe harbor rule for assets transferred in securitizations . in 2009 and 2010 , the fdic issued a series of changes to its safe harbor rule , with its new final rule for its securitization safe harbor , issued in 2010 , requiring issuers to comply with a new set of requirements in order to qualify for the safe harbor . issuances out of the american express credit account master trust ( the lending trust ) are grandfathered under the new fdic final rule . the trust for the company Â ’ s cardmember charge receivable securitization ( the charge trust ) does not satisfy the criteria table of contents required to be covered by the fdic Â ’ s new safe harbor rule , nor did it meet the requirements to be covered by the safe harbor rule existing prior to 2009 . it was structured and continues to be structured such that the financial assets transferred to the charge trust would not be deemed to be property of the originating banks in the event the fdic is appointed as a receiver or conservator of the originating banks . the company has received confirmation from moody Â ’ s , s & p and fitch , which rate issuances from the charge trust , that they will continue to rate issuances from such trust in the same manner as they have historically , even though the charge trust does not satisfy the requirements to be covered by the fdic Â ’ s safe harbor rule . nevertheless , one or more of the rating agencies may ultimately conclude that in the absence of compliance with the safe harbor rule , the highest rating a charge trust security could receive would be based on the originating bank Â ’ s unsecured debt rating . if one or more rating agencies come to this conclusion , it could adversely impact the company Â ’ s capacity and cost of using its charge trust as a source of funding for its business . liquidity managementthe company Â ’ s liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of cash , readily-marketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity , such that the company can continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements , even in the event it is unable to raise new funds under its regular funding programs . the company has in place a liquidity risk policy that sets out the company Â ’ s approach to managing liquidity risk on an enterprise-wide basis . the company incurs and accepts liquidity risk arising in the normal course of offering its products and services . the liquidity risks that the company is exposed to can arise from a variety of sources , and thus its liquidity management strategy includes a variety of parameters , assessments and guidelines , including but not limited to : Â • Â   maintaining a diversified set of funding sources ( refer to funding strategy section for more details ) ; Â   Â • Â   maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off-balance sheet liquidity sources ; and Â   Â • Â   projecting cash inflows and outflows from a variety of sources and under a variety of scenarios , including contingent liquidity exposures such as unused cardmember lines of credit and collateral requirements for derivative transactions . the company Â ’ s current liquidity target is to have adequate liquidity in the form of excess cash and readily-marketable securities that are easily convertible into cash to satisfy all maturing long-term funding obligations for a 12-month period . in addition to its cash and readily-marketable securities , the company maintains a variety of contingent liquidity resources , such as access to secured borrowings through its undrawn amount under the conduit facility and the federal reserve discount window as well as committed bank credit facilities . as of june Â   30 , 2011 , the company Â ’ s excess cash and readily-marketable securities available to fund long-term maturities were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( billions ) Â   total Â   cash Â   $ 17 . 8 ( a ) readily-marketable securities Â   Â

cash ( cash available to fund day-to-day operations ) . cash also includes $ 206 Â   million classified as other assets on the company Â ’ s consolidated balance sheets , which is held against certain forthcoming asset-backed securitization maturities . Â   ( b ) Â   consists of certain available-for-sale investment securities ( u . s . treasury and agency securities , and government-guaranteed debt ) that are considered highly liquid . Â   ( c ) Â   consists of commercial paper and u . s . retail cds with original maturities of three and six months . table of contents the upcoming approximate maturities of the company Â ’ s long-term unsecured debt , debt issued in connection with asset-backed securitizations and long-term certificates of deposit are as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( billions ) Â   debt maturities Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   unsecured Â   Â   asset-backed Â   Â   certificates of Â   Â   Â   quarter ending : Â   debt Â   Â   securitizations Â   Â   deposit Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   totalseptember Â   30 , 2011 Â   $ 0 . 7 Â   Â   $ 0 . 6 Â   Â   $ 0 . 7 Â   Â   $ 2 . 0december Â   31 , 2011 Â   Â   6 . 9 Â   Â   Â   Â — Â   Â   Â   1 . 3 Â   Â   Â   8 . 2march Â   31 , 2012 Â   Â   1 . 0 Â   Â   Â   0 . 5 Â   Â   Â   1 . 2 Â   Â   Â   2 . 7june Â   30 , 2012 Â   Â   1 . 2 Â   Â   Â   2 . 0 Â   Â   Â   0 . 8 Â   Â   Â   4 . 0 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   total Â   $ 9 . 8 Â   Â   $ 3 . 1 Â   Â   $ 4 . 0 Â   Â   $ 16 . 9 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   the company Â ’ s financing needs for the next 12 Â   months are expected to arise from these debt and deposit maturities as well as changes in business needs , including changes in outstanding cardmember loans and receivables as well as acquisition activities . the company considers various factors in determining the amount of liquidity it maintains , such as economic and financial market conditions , seasonality in business operations , growth in its businesses , potential acquisitions or dispositions , the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources , and regulatory and credit rating agency considerations . the yield the company receives on its cash and readily-marketable securities is , generally , less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances . thus , the company incurs substantial net interest costs on these amounts . the level of net interest costs will be dependent on the size of the company Â ’ s cash and readily-marketable securities holdings , as well as the difference between its cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields . securitized borrowing capacitythe company maintained a $ 3 Â   billion committed , revolving , secured financing facility sponsored by and with liquidity backup provided by a syndicate of banks as of june Â   30 , 2011 . the facility is used in the ordinary course of business to fund seasonal working capital needs , as well as further enhance the company Â ’ s contingent funding resources . federal reserve discount windowthe banks are insured depository institutions that have the capability of borrowing from the federal reserve bank of san francisco , subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that they may pledge . the federal reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowing made through the discount window . whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window , and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral , remain in the discretion of the federal reserve . the company had approximately $ 33 . 8 Â   billion as of june Â   30 , 2011 , in u . s . credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through its existing securitization trusts , or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity , subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria . table of contents committed bank credit facilitiesthe company maintained committed bank credit facilities as of june Â   30 , 2011 , as follows : Â   Â   Â   parent Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   centurion Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( billions ) Â   company Â   Â   credco Â   Â   bank Â   Â   fsb Â   Â   total Â   ( a ) committed ( b ) Â   $ 0 . 8 Â   Â   $ 9 . 1 Â   Â   $ 0 . 4 Â   Â   $ 0 . 4 Â   Â   $ 10 . 7 Â   outstanding Â   $ Â — Â   Â   $ 4 . 2 Â   Â   $ Â — Â   Â   $ Â — Â   Â   $ 4 . 2 Â   Â   ( a ) Â   does not include the $ 3 . 0 Â   billion secured borrowing capacity described above .

arrangementsas of june Â   30 , 2011 , the company had approximately $ 235 Â   billion of unused credit available to cardmembers as part of established lending product agreements . total unused credit available to cardmembers does not represent potential future cash requirements , as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn . the company Â ’ s charge card products have no pre-set limit and , therefore , are not reflected in unused credit available to cardmembers . cash flowscash flows from operating activitiescash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for ( i ) Â   non-cash items included in net income , including provisions for losses , depreciation and amortization , deferred taxes , and stock-based compensation and ( ii ) Â   changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities , which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of various payments . for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2011 , net cash provided by operating activities of $ 4 . 4 Â   billion decreased $ 0 . 1 Â   billion compared to $ 4 . 5 Â   billion for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 due to lower provisions for losses , decreases in non-cash adjustments for deferred taxes and other , and changes in other assets and other receivables , offset by higher net income in 2011 and changes in accounts payable and other liabilities . cash flows from investing activitiesthe company Â ’ s investing activities primarily include funding cardmember loans and receivables and the company Â ’ s available-for-sale investment portfolio . for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2011 , net cash provided by investing activities of $ 5 . 5 Â   billion was flat compared to the six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 due to lower purchases of investments and fluctuations in restricted cash in 2011 , offset by lower maturity and redemption of investments and a net increase in cardmember loans and receivables . cash flows from financing activitiesthe company Â ’ s financing activities primarily include issuing and repaying debt , taking customer deposits , issuing and repurchasing its common shares , and paying dividends . for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2011 , net cash used in financing activities of $ 3 . 3 Â   billion decreased $ 2 . 5 Â   billion compared to $ 5 . 8 Â   billion for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 due to an increase in the issuance of long-term debt , a reduction in principal payments on long-term debt , and an increase in customer deposits , partially offset by cash outflows related to the repurchase of common shares and lower net changes in short-term borrowings as compared to the same period in 2010 . table of contents certain legislative , regulatory and other developmentsas a participant in the financial services industry , the company is subject to a wide array of regulations applicable to its businesses . as a bank holding company and a financial holding company , the company is subject to the regulations , policies and overall supervision of the federal reserve . in addition , the extreme disruptions in the capital markets that commenced in mid-2007 and the resulting instability and failure of numerous financial institutions have led to a number of changes in the financial services industry , including significant additional regulation and the formation of additional regulatory bodies . although the long-term impact on the company of much of the recent and pending legislative and regulatory initiatives remains uncertain , the company expects that compliance requirements and expenditures will continue to rise for financial services firms , including the company , as the legislation and rules become effective over the course of the next several years . the card actthe company is subject to the provisions of the legislation known as the card act , which was enacted in may Â   2009 to fundamentally reform credit card billing practices , pricing and disclosure requirements . this legislation accelerated the effective date and expanded the scope of amendments to the rules regarding unfair or deceptive acts or practices ( udap ) Â   and the truth in lending act that restrict certain credit and charge card practices and require expanded disclosures to consumers , which were adopted in december Â   2008 by federal bank regulators in the united states . together , the legislation and the regulatory amendments include , among other matters , rules relating to the imposition by card issuers of interest rate increases on outstanding balances and the allocation of payments in respect of outstanding balances with different interest rates . certain other provisions of the card act require penalty fees to be reasonable and proportional in relation to the circumstances for which such fees are levied and require issuers to evaluate past interest rate increases twice per year to determine whether it is appropriate to reduce such increases . the company has made changes to its product terms and practices that are designed to mitigate the impact on company revenue of the changes required by the card act and the regulatory amendments . these changes include instituting product-specific increases in pricing on purchases and cash advances , modifying the criteria pursuant to which the penalty rate of interest is imposed on a cardmember and assessing late fees on certain charge products at an earlier date than previously assessed . although the company believes its actions to mitigate the impact of the card act have , to date , been largely effective ( as evidenced in part by the net interest yield for its u . s . lending portfolio ) , the impacts of certain other provisions of the card act are still subject to some uncertainty ( such as the requirement to periodically reevaluate annual percentage rate ( apr ) increases ) . accordingly , in the event the actions undertaken by the company to date to offset the impact of the new legislation and regulations are not ultimately effective , they could have a material adverse effect on the company Â ’ s results of operations , including its revenue and net income . dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection actin july Â   2010 , president obama signed into law the dodd-frank reform act . the dodd-frank reform act is comprehensive in scope and contains a wide array of provisions intended to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets . among other matters , the law creates a new independent consumer financial protection bureau ( the bureau ) , which regulates consumer credit across the u . s . economy . the bureau has broad rulemaking authority over providers of credit , savings , payment and other consumer financial products and services with respect to certain federal consumer financial laws . moreover , the bureau has examination and enforcement authority with respect to certain federal consumer financial laws for some providers of consumer financial products and services , including the company and its insured depository institution subsidiaries . the bureau is directed to prohibit Â “ unfair , deceptive or abusive Â ” practices , and to ensure that all consumers have access to fair , transparent and competitive markets for consumer financial products and services . table of contents under the dodd-frank reform act , the federal reserve is authorized to regulate interchange fees paid to issuing banks on debit card and certain general-use prepaid card transactions to ensure that they are Â “ reasonable and proportional Â ” to the cost of processing individual transactions , and to prohibit debit and general-use prepaid payment card networks and issuers from requiring transactions to be processed on a single payment network . the federal reserve issued its final rule on june Â   29 , 2011 , which provides that the regulations on interchange and routing do not apply to a three-party network like american express when it acts as both the issuer and the network for its prepaid cards , and is therefore not a Â “ payment card network Â ” which is subject to the rule . the dodd-frank reform act also prohibits credit / debit networks from restricting a merchant from offering discounts or incentives to customers in order to encourage them to use a particular form of payment , or from restricting a merchant from setting certain minimum and maximum transaction amounts for credit cards , as long as any such discounts or incentives or any minimum or maximum transaction amounts do not discriminate among issuers or networks and comply with applicable federal or state disclosure requirements . the dodd-frank reform act also authorizes the federal reserve to establish heightened capital , leverage and liquidity standards , risk management requirements , concentration limits on credit exposures , mandatory resolution plans ( so-called Â “ living wills Â ” ) and stress tests for , among others , large bank holding companies , such as the company , that have greater than $ 50 Â   billion in assets . in addition , certain derivative transactions will be required to be centrally cleared , which may create or increase collateral posting requirements for the company . many provisions of the dodd-frank reform act require the adoption of rules for implementation . in addition , the dodd-frank reform act mandates multiple studies , which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action . these new rules and studies will be implemented and undertaken over a period of several years . accordingly , the ultimate consequences of the dodd-frank reform act and its implementing regulations on the company Â ’ s business , results of operations and financial condition are uncertain at this time . other legislative and regulatory initiativesthe credit and charge card sector also faces continuing scrutiny in connection with the fees merchants pay to accept cards . although investigations into the way bankcard network members collectively set the Â “ interchange Â ” ( that is , the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuing bank in Â “ four party Â ” payment networks , like visa and mastercard ) have largely been a subject of regulators outside the united states , legislation was previously introduced in congress designed to give merchants antitrust immunity to negotiate interchange collectively with card networks and to regulate certain card network practices . although , unlike the visa and mastercard networks , the american express network does not collectively set fees , antitrust actions and government regulation relating to merchant pricing could ultimately affect all networks . in addition to the provisions of the dodd-frank reform act regarding merchants Â ’ ability to offer discounts or incentives to encourage customers Â ’ use of a particular form of payment , a number of u . s . states are also considering legislation that would prohibit card networks from imposing similar conditions , restrictions and penalties on merchants . also , other countries in which the company operates have been considering and in some cases adopting similar legislation and rules that would impose changes on certain practices of card issuers and bankcard networks . any or all of the above changes to the legal and regulatory environment in which the company operates could have a material adverse effect on the company Â ’ s results of operations . refer to Â “ consolidated capital resources and liquidity Â ” for a discussion of the series of international capital and liquidity standards published by basel . table of contents business segment resultsbeginning in the first quarter of 2011 , the company changed its segment allocation methodology to better align segment reporting with the company Â ’ s previously announced management reorganization , which has been implemented over the last several quarters . the reorganization included the formation of the enterprise growth group , which is reported in the corporate & other segment . starting in the first quarter of 2011 , certain business activities such as loyalty edge and global foreign exchange services that were previously managed and reported in the uscs and gcs operating segments , respectively , are now managed by enterprise growth and reported in the corporate & other segment . the reorganization also included consolidation of certain corporate support functions into the global services organization . greater centralization of activities has led to modifications in the costs being allocated from the corporate & other segment to the reported operating segments starting in the first quarter of 2011 . prior period segment results have been revised for these changes . in addition , beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010 , the company completed its conversion to a new general ledger platform . this conversion enabled the company to streamline its ledger reporting unit structure , resulting in a reconfiguration of intercompany accounts . these changes have the effect of altering intercompany balances among segments , thus altering reported total segment assets . total segment assets presented since the first quarter of 2011 reflect the changes described above . this conversion had no impact on segment results , segment capital or return on segment capital metrics . u . s . card services Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   three months ended Â   Â   six months ended Â   Â   june 30 , Â   Â   june 30 , ( millions )

percent to $ 665 Â   million and $ 1 . 2 Â   billion for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2011 , respectively , as compared to the same periods a year ago . total revenues net of interest expense increased $ 152 Â   million or 4 Â   percent and $ 227 Â   million or 3 percent to $ 3 . 8 Â   billion and $ 7 . 3 Â   billion for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2011 , respectively , primarily driven by higher discount revenue , net card fees and other , partially offset by lower net interest income . discount revenue , net card fees and other revenues increased $ 200 Â   million or 8 Â   percent and $ 405 million or 8 Â   percent to $ 2 . 7 Â   billion and $ 5 . 2 Â   billion for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2011 , respectively , primarily due to higher discount revenue resulting from billed business growth and increases in travel sales , partially offset by lower other commissions and fees due to reduced foreign exchange conversion and delinquency-related fees . billed business for both the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2011 increased 13 Â   percent , primarily driven by an 11 Â   percent and 12 percent higher average spending per proprietary basic cards-in-force , as compared to the same periods in the prior year . interest income of $ 1 . 3 Â   billion and $ 2 . 6 Â   billion for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2011 , respectively , decreased $ 52 Â   million or 4 Â   percent and $ 169 Â   million or 6 Â   percent , respectively , primarily due to a lower yield on cardmember loans . interest expense of $ 200 Â   million for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2011 , decreased $ 4 Â   million or 2 Â   percent , primarily reflecting a lower cost of funds , partially offset by an increase in funding requirements due to a higher average charge card receivables balance . interest expense of $ 403 million increased $ 9 Â   million or 2 Â   percent for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2011 , primarily due to a higher average charge card receivables balance . provisions for losses of $ 228 Â   million and $ 275 Â   million for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2011 , respectively , decreased $ 291 Â   million or 56 Â   percent and $ 931 Â   million or 77 Â   percent , respectively , primarily reflecting improved cardmember loan credit trends , partially offset by a higher charge card provision resulting from higher business volumes . the lending net write-off rate decreased to 3 . 2 Â   percent and 3 . 4 Â   percent for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2011 versus 6 . 2 Â   percent and 6 . 7 Â   percent for the same periods in the prior year . the charge card net write-off rate was 1 . 5 Â   percent and 1 . 6 Â   percent for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2011 versus 1 . 6 percent and 1 . 7 Â   percent for the same periods in the prior year . table of contents expenses of $ 2 . 6 Â   billion and $ 5 . 3 Â   billion increased $ 364 Â   million or 16 Â   percent and $ 822 million or 19 Â   percent for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2011 , respectively , mainly due to increased marketing , promotion , rewards and cardmember services expenses , and , to a lesser extent , higher salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses . marketing , promotion , rewards and cardmember services expenses of $ 1 . 7 Â   billion and $ 3 . 4 Â   billion increased $ 279 Â   million or 20 Â   percent and $ 673 Â   million or 25 Â   percent for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2011 , respectively , driven by increased rewards costs , which reflect greater rewards-related spending volumes , higher co-brand expense , and increases in the ultimate redemption rate and weighted average cost per point . these increases in the ultimate redemption rate and weighted average cost per point , both of which impacted the expense related to points earned during the period as well as the membership rewards liability for unredeemed points at the beginning of the period , led to a more pronounced increase in rewards costs during this period than in previous periods . in addition , cardmember service costs increased as a result of new benefits offered to cardmembers . these increases were partially offset by lower marketing and promotion costs due to lower product media spending . salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses were $ 942 Â   million and $ 1 . 8 Â   billion for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2011 , respectively , an increase of $ 85 Â   million or 10 percent and $ 149 Â   million or 9 Â   percent , reflecting investments in various customer service initiatives , a lower benefit in the second quarter of 2011 compared to the second quarter of 2010 related to hedging the company Â ’ s fixed-rate debt , as well as an expense for the reduction of amounts previously capitalized related to software developed by third-party vendors . the effective tax rate was 26 Â   percent and 33 Â   percent for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2011 , respectively . the effective tax rate for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2011

past billing or earlier . therefore , the net write-offs for the first quarter of 2010 include net write-offs of approximately $ 48 Â   million for gcs resulting from this write-off methodology change , which increased the net loss ratio and decreased the 90 Â   days past billing metric for this segment , but did not have a substantial impact on provisions for losses . results of operations for the

Â   table of contents in addition , assuming achievement of such financial targets , the company has sought to return at least 65 Â   percent of the capital it generates to shareholders as a dividend or through the repurchase of common stock . the company met or exceeded these targets for most of the past decade . however , during 2008 and 2009 , its performance fell short of the targets due to the effects of the continuing global economic downturn . the company Â ’ s share repurchase program was suspended in 2008 and , as a result , the amount of capital generated that is returned to shareholders has been below the levels achieved earlier in the decade . the company believes it will be positioned , over the long term , to generate revenue and earnings growth in line with its historical target levels . however , evolving market , regulatory and debt investor expectations will likely cause the company , as well as other financial institutions , to maintain in future years a higher level of capital than they have historically maintained . these higher capital requirements would in turn lead , all other things being equal , to lower future roe than the company has historically targeted . in addition , the company recognizes it may need to maintain higher capital levels to support acquisitions that can augment its business growth . in combination , these factors have led the company to revise its on average and over time roe financial target to 25 Â   percent or more . in establishing the revised roe target , the company has assumed that it will seek to maintain a 10 Â   percent tier 1 common ratio , although the actual future capital requirements applicable to the company are uncertain and will not be known until further guidance is provided in connection with certain initiatives , such as basel iii and the implementation of regulations under the recent united states financial reform legislation . international and united states banking regulators could also increase the capital ratio levels at which banks would be deemed to be Â “ well capitalized Â ” . refer to capital strategy below . the revised roe target also assumes the company would need to maintain capital to finance moderate-sized acquisitions , although the actual magnitude of these transactions cannot be determined at this time . if the company achieves its eps target as well as the revised roe target , it would seek to return , on average and over time , at least 50 Â   percent of the capital it generates to shareholders as a dividend or through the repurchase of common stock rather than the 65 Â   percent level referred to above . certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the current presentation . certain of the statements in this form 10-q report are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 . refer to the Â “ forward-looking statements Â ” section below . bank holding company the company is a bank holding company under the bank holding company act of 1956 and the federal reserve board ( federal reserve ) is the company Â ’ s primary federal regulator . as such , the company is subject to the federal reserve Â ’ s regulations , policies and minimum capital standards . current economic environment / outlookthe company Â ’ s results for the second quarter of 2010 continued to reflect an improved economic environment . year-over-year cardmember spending volumes grew both in the united states and internationally , and across all of the company Â ’ s businesses , due to both higher absolute spending levels and relatively weak volumes last year amidst the global economic slowdown . growth in both the number of transactions and average transaction size contributed to the higher spending . double-digit spending growth as compared to last year continued into the third quarter of 2010 through july . such growth rate was down slightly from june of 2010 reflecting a more challenging year-over-year comparison . the company continues to see a sharp divergence between the positive growth rates in customer spending on credit cards and lower borrowing levels , due in part to changing consumer behavior and the company Â ’ s strategic and risk-related actions . the company expects the difference in growth rates in credit card spending and loan balances to continue over the near term . while the offsetting influences of stronger billings growth and lower loan balances challenge overall revenue growth , improving credit trends and well controlled operating expenses have provided an ability to invest in the business at significant levels and also generate strong earnings . some of these investments are focused on near term metrics , while others are allocated toward initiatives focused on the medium to long-term success of the company . the improving credit trends contributed to the reduction in the second quarter of approximately $ 500 Â   million in loss reserves , although reserve coverage ratios remain strong . the company plans to maintain its investments in the business at substantial levels to the extent the benefits from its credit performance continue and intends to dedicate resources to select partnerships and acquisitions . Â   table of contents net interest yield for the second quarter decreased year-over-year . the lower yield reflects higher payment rates and lower revolving levels , and the implementation of elements of the recently passed the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 ( the Â “ card act Â ” ) , which were partially offset by the benefit of certain repricing initiatives effective during 2009 and the first quarter of 2010 . the company Â ’ s objective is to attain a net interest yield in the us consumer business closer to historic levels of approximately 9 Â   percent1despite the improved economic environment and the favorable spending and credit trends discussed above , the company recognizes that certain challenges remain . these include high unemployment levels , uncertainty in customer behavior , volatile consumer confidence and the legislative and regulatory environment , including the uncertain impact of the card act and the recently enacted dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act . refer to certain legislative , regulatory and other developments below . reengineering initiativesin the fourth quarter of 2008 and the second quarter of 2009 the company undertook major reengineering initiatives that together were expected to produce cost benefits of approximately $ 2 . 6 Â   billion in 2009 versus the previously anticipated spending levels . these initiatives included reducing staffing levels and compensation expenses ( expected benefit of $ 875 Â   million in 2009 ) , reducing certain operating costs ( expected benefit of $ 250 Â   million in 2009 ) and scaling back investment spending ( expected benefit of $ 1 . 5 Â   billion in 2009 ) . the company recorded restructuring charges of $ 404 Â   million ( $ 262 Â   million after-tax ) in the fourth quarter of 2008 and $ 182 Â   million ( $ 118 Â   million after-tax ) in the second quarter of 2009 , respectively , primarily associated with severance and other costs related to the expected elimination of a total of approximately 11 , 000 positions , which accounted for approximately 17 Â   percent of its global workforce as of september Â   30 , 2008 . as the company has previously indicated , beginning in the third quarter of 2009 , benefits related to better than initially forecasted credit and business trends for 2009 , which have continued into 2010 , were utilized to increase spending on marketing and other business-building initiatives during the second half of the year . this has reduced the expected carryover into 2010 of the reengineering benefits previously discussed in 2009 related to investment spending and position eliminations , although the employee count decline of 7 , 500 , or 11 Â   percent , since september Â   30 , 2008 , primarily due to these initiatives , will continue to provide benefits . in the second quarter of 2010 , income from continuing operations reflects $ 4 Â   million ( $ 3 Â   million after-tax ) of net reengineering benefit . discontinued operations for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2009 , the operating results , assets and liabilities , and cash flows of american express international deposit company ( aeidc ) , which was sold to standard chartered in the third quarter of 2009 , have been removed from the corporate & other segment and reported separately within the discontinued operations captions on the company Â ’ s consolidated financial statements . Â   Â   Â   Â   1 Â   as discussed on page 41 below , net interest yield is a non-gaap measure . the comparable gaap measure is not determinable at this time .

Â   ( c ) Â   this calculation is designed to reflect pricing at merchants accepting general purpose american express cards . it represents the percentage of billed business ( both proprietary and global network services ) retained by the company from merchants it acquires , prior to payments to third parties unrelated to merchant acceptance . Â   ( d ) Â   average basic cardmember spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only . average fee per card is computed based on net card fees , including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs , plus card fees included in interest and fees on loans ( including related amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs ) , divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force . the card fees related to cardmember loans included in interest and fees on loans were $ 48 Â   million and $ 45 Â   million for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively , and $ 99 Â   million and $ 85 Â   million for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively . the adjusted average fee per card is computed in the same manner , but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs ( a portion of which is charge card related and included in net card fees and a portion of which is lending related and included in interest and fees on loans ) . the amount of amortization excluded was $ 56 Â   million and $ 62 Â   million for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively , and $ 107 Â   million and $ 132 Â   million for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively . the company presents adjusted average fee per card because management believes this metric presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of its proprietary card products .

Â   ( b ) Â   effective january Â   1 , 2010 , the company revised the time period in which past due cardmember receivables in international card services and global commercial services are written off when they are 180 Â   days past due or earlier , consistent with applicable bank regulatory guidance and the write-off methodology adopted for u . s . card services in the fourth quarter of 2008 . previously , receivables were written off when they were 360 Â   days past billing or earlier . therefore , the net write-offs for the first quarter of 2010 included net write-offs of approximately $ 60 Â   million for international card services and approximately $ 48 Â   million for global commercial services resulting from this write-off methodology change , which increased the net loss ratios and decreased the 90 Â   days past billing metrics for these segments , but did not have a substantial impact on provisions for losses . Â   table of contents Â   Â   Â   ( c ) Â   beginning with the first quarter of 2010 , the company has revised the net loss ratio to exclude net write-offs related to unauthorized transactions , consistent with the methodology for calculation of the net write-off rate for u . s . card services . the metrics for prior periods have not been revised for this change as it was deemed immaterial . Â   ( d ) Â   for periods ended on or prior to december Â   31 , 2009 , the company Â ’ s cardmember loans and related debt performance information on a gaap basis was referred to as the Â “ owned Â ” basis presentation . the information presented on a gaap basis for such periods includes only non-securitized cardmember loans that were included in the company Â ’ s balance sheet . effective january Â   1 , 2010 , the company Â ’ s securitized portfolio of cardmember loans and related debt is also consolidated on its balance sheet upon the adoption of the new gaap . accordingly , beginning january Â   1 , 2010 , the gaap basis presentation includes both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans . refer to page 63 for a discussion of gaap basis information . Â   ( e ) Â   reflects the new gaap effective january Â   1 , 2010 , which resulted in the consolidation of the american express credit account master trust ( the lending trust ) , reflecting $ 29 . 0 Â   billion of additional cardmember loans along with a $ 2 . 5 Â   billion loan loss reserve on the company Â ’ s balance sheets . Â   ( f ) Â   this calculation includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the cardmember loan portfolio , and thus is not representative of net interest yield on cardmember loans . the calculation includes interest income and interest expense attributable to investment securities and other interest-bearing deposits as well as to cardmember loans , and interest expense attributable to other activities , including cardmember receivables .

Â   ( b ) Â   for periods ended on or prior to december Â   31 , 2009 , the company Â ’ s cardmember loans and related debt performance information on a gaap basis was referred to as the Â “ owned Â ” basis presentation . the information presented on a gaap basis for such periods includes only non-securitized cardmember loans that were included in the company Â ’ s balance sheet . effective january Â   1 , 2010 , the company Â ’ s securitized portfolio of cardmember loans and related debt is also consolidated on its balance sheet upon the adoption of the new gaap . accordingly , beginning january Â   1 , 2010 , the gaap basis presentation includes both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans . refer to page 63 for a discussion of gaap basis information .

Â   table of contents the following discussions regarding consolidated results of operations and consolidated liquidity and capital resources are presented on a basis consistent with gaap unless otherwise noted . consolidated results of operations for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2010 and 2009the company Â ’ s consolidated net income for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2010 increased $ 680 million or more than 100 Â   percent from the same period a year ago to $ 1 . 0 Â   billion , and diluted eps increased significantly to $ 0 . 84 from $ 0 . 09 . on a trailing 12-month basis , roe was 23 . 5 Â   percent , up from 13 . 2 Â   percent a year ago . the company Â ’ s total revenues net of interest expense and total expenses increased by approximately 13 Â   percent , and provisions for losses decreased by approximately 59 Â   percent , for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2010 . assuming no changes in foreign currency exchange rates , total revenues net of interest expense and total expenses increased by approximately 12 Â   percent and provisions for losses decreased by approximately 59 Â   percent for the three months ended june Â   30 , 20102total revenues net of interest expenseconsolidated total revenues net of interest expense were $ 6 . 9 Â   billion for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , up $ 766 Â   million or 13 Â   percent from $ 6 . 1 Â   billion in the same period a year ago . the increase in total revenues net of interest expense was driven by the new gaap effective january Â   1 , 2010 , which caused the reporting of write-offs related to securitized loans to move from securitization income , net in the second quarter of 2009 to provisions for cardmember loan losses in the second quarter of 2010 . in addition , total revenues net of interest expense reflects higher discount revenues , higher other commissions and fees and higher travel commissions and fees . this was partially offset by lower net interest income in 2010 compared in 2009 to the combined net interest income on the non-securitized loan portfolio and the net interest income on the securitized loan portfolio ( a component of securitization income , net in 2009 ) , reduced other revenues and lower net card fees . discount revenue increased $ 429 Â   million or 13 Â   percent to $ 3 . 7 Â   billion as a result of a 16 Â   percent increase in billed business . the lesser revenue versus billed business growth reflects the relatively faster growth in billed business related to gns , where discount revenue is shared with card issuing partners , as well as a co-brand partnership investment . the average discount rate was 2 . 56 Â   percent and 2 . 55 Â   percent for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively . as indicated in prior quarters , selective repricing initiatives , changes in the mix of business and volume-related pricing discounts will likely result in some erosion of the average discount rate over time . u . s . billed business and billed business outside the united states were up 14 Â   percent and 19 percent , respectively , primarily due to increases in average spending per proprietary basic card . billed business outside the united states was up 16 Â   percent assuming no changes in foreign currency exchange rates . Â   Â   Â   Â   2 Â   these currency rate adjustments assume a constant exchange rate between periods for purposes of currency translation into u . s . dollars ( i . e . , assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current year apply to the corresponding year-earlier period against which such results are being compared ) . management believes this presentation is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare the company Â ’ s performance from one period to another without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates .

Â   table of contents other revenues decreased $ 185 Â   million or 28 Â   percent to $ 485 Â   million , primarily reflecting the $ 211 million gain in the second quarter of 2009 resulting from the sale of 50 Â   percent of the company Â ’ s equity holdings in industrial and commercial bank of china ( icbc ) , partially offset by higher gns partner-related revenue . interest income increased $ 510 Â   million or 40 Â   percent to $ 1 . 8 Â   billion in 2010 . interest and fees on loans increased $ 576 Â   million or 53 Â   percent to $ 1 . 7 Â   billion , driven by an increase in the average loan balance resulting from the consolidation of securitized receivables in accordance with the new gaap effective january Â   1 , 2010 . interest income related to securitized receivables was reported in securitization income , net in prior periods , but is now reported in interest and fees on loans . the increase related to this consolidation was partially offset by lower average non-securitized cardmember loans , as well as by a lower yield on cardmember loans reflecting higher payment rates , lower revolving levels , and the implementation of elements of the card act , which were partially offset by the benefit of certain repricing initiatives effective during 2009 and the first quarter of 2010 . worldwide cardmember loan balances of $ 57 . 3 Â   billion as of june Â   30 , 2010 increased 75 percent from $ 32 . 8 Â   billion as of december Â   31 , 2009 , due to the adoption of the new gaap effective january Â   1 , 2010 . on a comparable managed basis , including securitized loans in both periods , cardmember loan balances of $ 57 . 3 Â   billion declined 7 . 3 Â   percent from $ 61 . 8 Â   billion as of december 31 , 2009 , reflecting higher cardmember payment rates and the growth of products with lower revolving balances , partially offset by higher cardmember spending levels during the first half of 2010 . for further discussion of the managed basis presentation , refer to cardmember loan portfolio presentation below . interest and dividends on investment securities decreased $ 71 Â   million or 36 Â   percent to $ 125 million , primarily reflecting the elimination of interest on retained securities driven by the new gaap effective january Â   1 , 2010 and decreased short-term investment levels . interest on deposits with banks and others increased $ 5 Â   million or 45 Â   percent to $ 16 Â   million , primarily due to the higher average deposit balances compared to the prior year . interest expense increased $ 63 Â   million or 12 Â   percent to $ 610 Â   million in 2010 . interest on deposits increased $ 32 Â   million or 30 Â   percent to $ 137 Â   million , as a significant increase in balances was partially offset by a lower cost of funds . interest on short-term borrowings decreased $ 6 Â   million or 86 Â   percent to $ 1 Â   million , reflecting lower short-term debt levels due to the strategic shift to deposit funding . interest on long-term debt and other increased $ 37 Â   million or 9 Â   percent to $ 472 million , reflecting the consolidation of long-term debt associated with securitized loans previously held off-balance sheet in accordance with the new gaap effective january Â   1 , 2010 . interest expense related to this debt was reported in securitization income , net in prior periods , but is now reported in long-term debt and other interest expense . excluding this impact , lower average debt outstanding unrelated to securitized loans was offset by a higher cost of funds . provisions for lossesconsolidated provisions for losses decreased $ 932 Â   million or 59 Â   percent compared to prior year to $ 652 Â   million , primarily driven by lower reserve requirements due to improving credit performance in both the charge card and cardmember loan portfolios , partially offset by the inclusion of write-offs related to securitized loans , which were reported in securitization income , net in periods prior to 2010 and are now reported in provisions for cardmember loan losses . charge card provisions decreased $ 141 Â   million or 59 Â   percent to $ 96 Â   million , reflecting lower write-off rates and improving delinquency rates . cardmember loans provisions decreased $ 763 Â   million or 59 Â   percent to $ 540 Â   million due to improved credit performance partially offset by an increase related to the inclusion of second quarter 2010 write-offs related to securitized loans as a result of new gaap effective january Â   1 , 2010 . other provision for losses decreased $ 28 Â   million or 64 Â   percent to $ 16 Â   million , reflecting lower merchant-related reserves . Â   table of contents expenses consolidated expenses were $ 4 . 6 Â   billion , up $ 521 Â   million or 13 Â   percent from $ 4 . 1 Â   billion for the same period in 2009 . the increase was a result of increased marketing and promotion expense , cardmember rewards expense and higher professional services expense , partially offset by lower salaries and employee benefits expense , cardmember services , communications expense and other , net expense . marketing and promotion expense increased $ 450 Â   million or more than 100 Â   percent to $ 802 Â   million , reflecting the increased investment spending resulting from better credit and business trends during the second quarter of 2010 . cardmember rewards expense increased $ 169 Â   million or 16 Â   percent to $ 1 . 2 Â   billion , primarily due to greater rewards-related spending volumes and higher co-brand expense . cardmember services expense decreased $ 9 Â   million or 7 Â   percent to $ 122 Â   million , primarily reflecting a reclassification of certain rewards costs to the cardmember rewards expense line . salaries and employee benefits expense decreased $ 55 Â   million or 4 Â   percent to $ 1 . 3 Â   billion , due to $ 154 Â   million of net severance costs associated with the company Â ’ s reengineering efforts in the second quarter of 2009 . excluding those charges , salaries and benefits increased 8 Â   percent as merit increases and higher incentive compensation expense were partially offset by lower employee levels and related expenses due to the benefits of the company Â ’ s reengineering initiatives . other , net expense decreased $ 49 Â   million or 44 Â   percent to $ 62 Â   million , primarily reflecting a $ 37 million favorable impact related to hedging the company Â ’ s fixed-rate debt in the second quarter of 2010 compared to a $ 61 Â   million unfavorable impact in the second quarter of 2009 . income taxesthe effective tax rate was 36 Â   percent and 18 Â   percent for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively . each of the periods reflects the level of pretax income in relation to recurring permanent tax benefits . the tax rate for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2010 also includes the impact of a $ 44 Â   million valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets associated with certain of the company Â ’ s non-u . s . travel operations and an increase of 2010 Â ’ s estimated annual effective tax rate during the quarter . consolidated results of operations for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 and 2009the company Â ’ s consolidated net income for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 increased $ 1 . 1 Â   billion compared to the same period a year ago to $ 1 . 9 Â   billion , and diluted eps increased $ 1 . 17 or more than 100 Â   percent to $ 1 . 57 . on a trailing 12-month basis , roe was 23 . 5 Â   percent , up from 13 . 2 percent a year ago . the company Â ’ s total revenues net of interest expense and total expenses increased by approximately 12 Â   percent and 18 Â   percent , respectively , and provisions for losses decreased by approximately 53 percent in the six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 . assuming no changes in foreign currency exchange rates , total revenues net of interest expense and total expenses increased by approximately 10 percent and 15 Â   percent , respectively , and provisions for losses decreased by approximately 54 percent in the six months ended june Â   30 , 20103 Â   Â   Â   Â   3 Â   these currency rate adjustments assume a constant exchange rate between periods for purposes of currency translation into u . s . dollars ( i . e . , assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current year apply to the corresponding year-earlier period against which such results are being compared ) . management believes this presentation is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare the company Â ’ s performance from one period to another without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates . Â   table of contents total revenues net of interest expenseconsolidated total revenues net of interest expense were $ 13 . 5 Â   billion , up $ 1 . 4 Â   billion or 12 percent for the same period a year ago . total revenues net of interest expense increased due primarily to higher discount revenues and higher net interest income on the combined securitized and non-securitized loan portfolio , offset mainly by reduced other revenues and lower net card fees . discount revenue increased $ 829 Â   million or 13 Â   percent to $ 7 . 2 Â   billion as a result of a 16 Â   percent increase in billed business partially offset by amounts shared with card issuing partners as well as co-brand partnership investments . the average discount rate was 2 . 56 Â   percent for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 . as previously indicated , changes in the mix of business and volume-related pricing discounts will likely result in some erosion of the average discount rate over time . u . s . billed business and billed business outside the united states were up 13 Â   percent and 23 percent , respectively , primarily due to increases in average spending per proprietary basic card . billed business outside the united states was up 15 Â   percent assuming no changes in foreign currency exchange rates . the table below summarizes selected statistics for increases and decreases during the six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   percentage increase Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   assuming no Â   Â   Â   percentage Â   Â   changes in foreign Â   Â   Â   increase / ( decrease ) Â   Â   exchange rates Â   worldwide : ( a ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   billed business Â   Â   16 % Â   Â   13 % proprietary billed business Â   Â   14 Â   Â   Â   12 Â   gns billed business ( b ) Â   Â   31 Â   Â   Â   24 Â   average spending per proprietary basic card Â   Â   22 Â   Â   Â   20 Â   basic cards-in-force Â   Â   1 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   united states : ( a ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   billed business Â   Â   13 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   average spending per proprietary basic card Â   Â   22 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   basic cards-in-force Â   Â   ( 2 ) Â   Â   Â   Â   proprietary consumer card billed business ( c ) Â   Â   12 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   proprietary small business billed business ( c ) Â   Â   9 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   proprietary corporate services billed business ( d ) Â   Â   20 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   outside the united states : ( a ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   billed business Â   Â   23 Â   Â   Â   15 Â   average spending per proprietary basic card Â   Â   25 Â   Â   Â   17 Â   basic cards-in-force Â   Â   4 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   proprietary consumer and small business billed business ( e ) Â   Â   16 Â   Â   Â   7 Â   proprietary corporate services billed business ( d ) Â   Â   25 Â   Â   Â   19 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( a ) Â   captions in the table above not designated as Â “ proprietary Â ” include both proprietary and global network services data .

institutions have led to a number of changes in the financial services industry , including significant additional regulation and the formation of additional regulatory bodies . the company Â ’ s conversion to a bank holding company in the fourth quarter of 2008 has increased the scope of its regulatory oversight and its compliance program . in addition , although the long-term impact on the company of much of the recent and pending legislative and regulatory initiatives remains uncertain , the company expects that compliance requirements and expenditures will continue to rise for financial services firms , including the company , as the legislation and rules become effective over the course of the next several years . the card actin may Â   2009 , the u . s . congress passed , and the president of the united states signed into law , legislation , known as the card act , to fundamentally reform credit card billing practices , pricing and disclosure requirements . this legislation accelerated the effective date and expanded the scope of amendments to the rules regarding unfair or deceptive acts or practices ( udap ) Â   and truth in lending act that restrict certain credit and charge card practices and require expanded disclosures to consumers , which were adopted in december Â   2008 by federal bank regulators in the united states . together , the legislation and the regulatory amendments , portions of which became effective commencing august Â   2009 , include , among other matters , rules relating to the imposition by card issuers of interest rate increases on outstanding balances and the allocation of payments in respect of outstanding balances with different interest rates . certain other provisions of the card act effective in august Â   2010 require penalty fees to be reasonable and proportional in relation to the circumstances for which such fees are levied and require issuers to evaluate past interest rate increases twice per year to determine whether it is appropriate to reduce such increases . the company has made changes to its product terms and practices that are designed to mitigate the impact on company revenue of the changes required by the card act and the regulatory amendments . these changes include instituting product-specific increases in pricing on purchases and cash advances , modifying the criteria pursuant to which the penalty rate of interest is imposed on a cardmember , assessing late fees on certain charge products at an earlier date than previously assessed and lowering the balance level at which a higher level of late fee is charged . although the company believes that its actions to mitigate the impact of the card act have , to date , been largely effective ( as evidenced in part by the net interest yield for its u . s . lending portfolio ) , certain other provisions of the card act are still subject to some regulatory uncertainty ( such as the requirement to periodically reevaluate apr increases ) . accordingly , in the event the actions undertaken by the company to date to offset the impact of the new legislation and regulations are not ultimately effective , they could have a material adverse effect on the company Â ’ s results of operations , including its revenue and net income . dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( the Â “ reform act Â ” ) in july Â   2010 , president obama signed into law the reform act . the reform act is comprehensive in scope and contains a wide array of provisions intending to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets . among other matters , the law creates a new independent consumer financial protection bureau , which will regulate consumer credit across the u . s . economy . the bureau will have broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit , savings , payment and other consumer financial products and services . under the reform act , the federal reserve is authorized to regulate interchange fees paid to banks on debit card transactions to ensure that they are Â “ reasonable and proportional Â ” to the cost of processing individual transactions , and to prohibit debit card networks and issuers from requiring transactions to be processed on a single payment network . the reform act also prohibits credit / debit network rules that would restrict a merchant from offering discounts to customers in order to encourage them to use a particular form of payment , as long as such discounts do not discriminate among issuers or networks , and that would restrict a merchant from setting certain minimum and maximum transaction amounts for credit cards . Â   table of contents the reform act has also eliminated an exception to certain types of liabilities applicable to rating agencies under the securities laws , which has resulted in the agencies Â ’ declining to give their consent to disclose ratings in registered offerings . this circumstance is of particular significance in offerings of asset-backed securities ( Â “ abs offerings Â ” ) , which require ratings disclosure that , subsequent to the reform act , can be made only with rating agency consent . although the sec staff has effectively relieved issuers from the ratings disclosure requirement through january Â   2011 , if the rating agencies do not change their position , the company will not be able to issue abs securities in registered offerings after such time , and may have to rely on private offerings to raise funding through its abs program . the reform act also authorizes the federal reserve to establish heightened capital , leverage and liquidity standards , risk management requirements , concentration limits on credit exposures , mandatory resolution plans ( so-called Â “ living wills Â ” ) and stress tests for , among others , large bank holding companies , such as the company , that have greater than $ 50 Â   billion in assets . in addition , most interest rate and currency swaps will be required to be exchange-traded which may increase collateral posting requirements for the company . many provisions of the reform act require the adoption of rules to implement . in addition , the reform act mandates multiple studies , which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action . these new rules and studies will be implemented and undertaken over a period of several years . accordingly , the ultimate consequences of the reform act and its implementing regulations on the company Â ’ s business , results of operations and financial condition are uncertain at this time . other legislative and regulatory initiativesin addition , other legislative initiatives remain in congress , including a proposed Â “ financial crisis responsibility fee Â ” that would be assessed on large financial institutions at approximately 0 . 15 Â   percent of total assets ( less tier 1 capital and less fdic-assessed deposits ) for at least the next ten years for the purpose of recovering projected losses from the troubled asset relief program , and other potential assessments . governments outside the united states are also considering wide-ranging and comprehensive financial services industry reform proposals , including various taxes on financial transactions and financial institutions Â ’ profits , assets , and compensation . any such legislative and regulatory changes could impact the profitability of the company Â ’ s business activities , require the company to change certain of its business practices and expose it to additional costs ( including increased compliance costs ) . the credit and charge card industry also faces continuing scrutiny in connection with the fees merchants are charged to accept cards . although investigations into the way bankcard network members collectively set the Â “ interchange Â ” ( that is , the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuing bank in Â “ four party Â ” payment networks , like visa and mastercard ) had largely been a subject of regulators outside the united states , legislation has been introduced in congress designed to give merchants antitrust immunity to negotiate interchange collectively with card networks and to regulate certain card network practices . although , unlike the visa and mastercard networks , the american express network does not collectively set fees , antitrust actions and government regulation of the bankcard networks Â ’ pricing could ultimately affect all networks . in addition to the provisions of the reform act regarding merchants ability to offer discounts , a number of u . s . states are also considering legislation that would prohibit card networks from imposing conditions , restrictions or penalties on a merchant if the merchant , among other things , ( i ) Â   provides a discount to a customer for using one form of payment versus another or one type of credit or charge card versus another , ( ii ) Â   imposes a minimum dollar requirement on customers with respect to the use of credit or charge cards or ( iii ) Â   chooses to accept credit and charge cards at some of its locations but not at others . such legislation has recently been enacted in vermont , and is pending enactment in several other states . Â   table of contents also , other countries in which the company operates have been considering and in some cases adopting similar legislation and rules that would impose changes on certain practices of card issuers and bankcard networks , which could have a material adverse effect on the company Â ’ s results of operations . our results of operations also could be adversely impacted by various proposals to reform the taxation of income earned by u . s . companies Â ’ international business operations and by other legislative action or inaction , including the potential failure of the u . s . congress to extend the active financing exception to subpart f of the internal revenue code . in december Â   2009 , the basel committee on banking supervision of the bank of international settlements ( bis ) Â   released a comprehensive list of proposals of new and revised international capital and liquidity standards for banks . these proposals , if enacted , could have a substantial impact on the capital structure and liquidity profiles of the banking industry , including those of the company . the committee is evaluating comments it received on the proposals prior to finalizing the content and timing of implementation of the proposals . during july , the committee issued several statements that reflected , among other things , tentative decisions it has reached on certain elements of the comprehensive proposals , including timelines for implementation , while re-affirming its goal to issue the proposals in final form before year end . refer to capital strategy above . Â   table of contents business segment resultsbeginning in the first quarter of 2010 , the company made changes to the manner in which it allocates equity capital as well as funding and the related interest expense charged to its reportable operating segments . the changes reflect the inclusion of additional factors in its allocation methodologies that the company believes more accurately reflect the capital characteristics and funding requirements of its segments . the segment results for quarters prior to the first quarter of 2010 have been revised for this change . debt , cash and investment balances associated with the company Â ’ s excess liquidity funding and the related net negative interest spread continues to be reported in the corporate & other segment . the change to interest allocation also impacted the consolidated and segment reported net interest yield on cardmember loans . as discussed more fully below , results are presented on a gaap basis unless otherwise stated . u . s . card services Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   three months ended Â   Â   six months ended Â   Â   Â   june 30 , Â   Â   june 30 , Â   ( millions ) Â   2010 Â   Â   2009 Â   Â   2010 Â   Â   2009 Â   revenues Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   discount revenue , net card fees and other Â   $ 2 , 534 Â   Â   $ 2 , 271 Â   Â   $ 4 , 851 Â   Â   $ 4 , 466 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   securitization income , net ( a ) Â   Â   Â — Â   Â   Â   ( 2 ) Â   Â   Â — Â   Â   Â   139 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   interest income Â   Â   1 , 315 Â   Â   Â   758 Â   Â   Â   2 , 726 Â   Â   Â   1 , 686 Â   interest expense Â   Â   204 Â   Â   Â   146 Â   Â   Â   394 Â   Â   Â   308 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   net interest income Â   Â   1 , 111 Â   Â   Â   612 Â   Â   Â   2 , 332 Â   Â   Â   1 , 378 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   total revenues net of interest expense Â   Â   3 , 645 Â   Â   Â   2 , 881 Â   Â   Â   7 , 183 Â   Â   Â   5 , 983 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   provisions for losses Â   Â   519 Â   Â   Â   1 , 190 Â   Â   Â   1 , 206 Â   Â   Â   2 , 573 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   total revenues net of interest expense after provisions for losses Â   Â   3 , 126 Â   Â   Â   1 , 691 Â   Â   Â   5 , 977 Â   Â   Â   3 , 410 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   expenses Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   marketing , promotion , rewards and cardmember services Â   Â   1 , 386 Â   Â   Â   1 , 021 Â   Â   Â   2 , 687 Â   Â   Â   1 , 910 Â   salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses Â   Â   912 Â   Â   Â   926 Â   Â   Â   1 , 785 Â   Â   Â   1 , 778 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   total Â   Â   2 , 298 Â   Â   Â   1 , 947 Â   Â   Â   4 , 472 Â   Â   Â   3 , 688 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   pretax segment income ( loss ) Â   Â   828 Â   Â   Â   ( 256 ) Â   Â   1 , 505 Â   Â   Â   ( 278 ) income tax provision ( benefit ) Â   Â   306 Â   Â   Â   ( 103 ) Â   Â   555 Â   Â   Â   ( 118 ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   segment income ( loss ) Â   $ 522 Â   Â   $ ( 153 ) Â   $ 950 Â   Â   $ ( 160 ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( a ) Â   in accordance with the new gaap effective january Â   1 , 2010 , the company no longer reports securitization income , net in its income statement .

Â   table of contents results of operations for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 and 2009the following discussion of u . s . card services Â ’ segment results of operations is presented on a gaap basis . u . s . card services reported segment income of $ 522 Â   million for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , a $ 675 Â   million increase from a loss of $ 153 Â   million for the same period a year ago . for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , u . s . card services reported segment income of $ 950 Â   million , a $ 1 . 1 billion increase from a loss of $ 160 Â   million for the same period a year ago . total revenues net of interest expense increased $ 764 Â   million or 27 Â   percent to $ 3 . 6 Â   billion for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2010 and $ 1 . 2 Â   billion or 20 Â   percent to $ 7 . 2 Â   billion for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , driven primarily by the increase in interest income , discount revenue , net card fees and other offset by the increase in interest expense . discount revenue , net card fees and other was $ 2 . 5 Â   billion for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , an increase of $ 263 Â   million or 12 Â   percent from $ 2 . 3 Â   billion for the same periods a year ago . the increase is primarily due to a 12 Â   percent increase in billed business . this line also reflects higher other commissions and fees driven by the new gaap effective january Â   1 , 2010 , which led to the inclusion of fees formerly recorded in securitization income , net , within discount revenue , net card fees and other and higher travel revenues , partially offset by lower commissions and fees and decreased net card fees . discount revenue , net card fees and other increased $ 385 Â   million or 9 percent to $ 4 . 9 Â   billion for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , due to higher discount revenue and other commissions and fees partially offset by the impact of the new gaap effective january Â   1 , 2010 and lower net card fees . interest income of $ 1 . 3 Â   billion and $ 2 . 7 Â   billion for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , respectively , increased $ 557 Â   million or 73 Â   percent and $ 1 . 0 Â   billion or 62 Â   percent , respectively , due to the first quarter 2010 consolidation of securitized cardmember loans , partially offset by a lower average balance of non-securitized cardmember loans and a reduction in loan portfolio yield . interest expense of $ 204 Â   million and $ 394 Â   million for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , respectively , increased $ 58 Â   million or 40 Â   percent and increased $ 86 Â   million or 28 Â   percent , respectively , as compared to a year ago , reflecting higher expense related to the first quarter 2010 consolidation of off-balance sheet debt . provisions for losses of $ 519 Â   million decreased $ 671 Â   million or 56 Â   percent for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , principally reflecting improving cardmember loan and charge card credit trends and a lower average balance of non-securitized loans , partially offset by the inclusion of write-offs on the securitized cardmember loans . provisions for losses of $ 1 . 2 Â   billion decreased $ 1 . 4 Â   billion or 53 Â   percent for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , primarily driven by improved credit performance but partially offset by the effect of the new gaap , effective january Â   1 , 2010 . expenses were $ 2 . 3 Â   billion , an increase of $ 351 Â   million or 18 Â   percent for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2010 due to increased marketing , promotion , rewards and cardmember services expenses , as salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses were relatively flat year over year . expenses were $ 4 . 5 Â   billion , an increase of $ 784 Â   million or 21 Â   percent , for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 due to increased marketing , promotion , rewards and cardmember services expenses , as salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses were relatively flat year over year . marketing , promotion , rewards and cardmember services expenses of $ 1 . 4 Â   billion and $ 2 . 7 Â   billion for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , respectively , increased $ 365 Â   million or 36 Â   percent and $ 777 Â   million or 41 Â   percent , respectively , reflecting increased marketing and promotion expense and higher rewards costs . Â   table of contents salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses were $ 912 Â   million for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , a decrease of $ 14 Â   million or 2 Â   percent , reflecting higher net charges during the second quarter of 2009 related to reengineering , a benefit in the second quarter of 2010 versus a charge in the year ago period related to hedging the company Â ’ s fixed-rate debt and higher fdic assessments in the second quarter of 2009 . salaries and employee benefits and other operating expense of $ 1 . 8 Â   billion for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , remained flat compared to same period a year ago with higher technology charges offset by a benefit related to hedging the company Â ’ s fixed-rated debt , lower salaries and benefits , and professional services . the effective tax rate was 37 Â   percent for both the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 . the effective tax rate was ( 40 ) Â   percent and ( 42 ) Â   percent for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2009 . the effective rate in the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2009 reflects the impact of recurring tax benefits on a pretax loss . cardmember loan portfolio presentationfor periods ended on or prior to december Â   31 , 2009 , the company Â ’ s non-securitized cardmember loan and related debt performance information on a gaap basis was referred to as the Â “ owned Â ” basis presentation . for such periods , the company also provided information on a non-gaap Â “ managed Â ” basis . unlike the gaap basis presentation , the managed basis presentation in such periods assumed there had been no off-balance sheet securitizations for the company Â ’ s u . s . card services segment ( the company has not securitized its international cardmember loans ) , resulting in the inclusion of all securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans and related debt in the company Â ’ s performance information . under the gaap basis presentation prior to securitization for the period ended on or prior to december Â   31 , 2009 , revenues and expenses from cardmember loans and related debt were reflected in the company Â ’ s income statements in other commissions and fees , net interest income and provisions for losses for cardmember loans . at the time of a securitization transaction , the securitized cardmember loans were removed from the company Â ’ s balance sheet , and the resulting gain on sale was reflected in securitization income , net , as well as a reduction to the provision for losses ( credit reserves were no longer recorded for the cardmember loans once sold ) . over the life of a securitization transaction , the company recognized the net cash flow from interest and fee collections on interests sold to investors ( the investors Â ’ interests ) after deducting interest paid on the investors Â ’ certificates , credit losses , contractual service fees , other expenses and changes in the fair value of the interest-only strip ( referred to as Â “ excess spread Â ” ) . these amounts , in addition to servicing fees and the non-credit components of the gains / ( losses ) from securitization activities were reflected in securitization income , net . the company also recognized interest income over the life of the securitization transaction related to the interest it retained ( i . e . , the seller Â ’ s interest ) . at the maturity of a securitization transaction , cardmember loans on the balance sheet increased , and the impact of the incremental required loss reserves was recorded in provisions for losses . under the managed basis presentation for periods ended on or prior to december Â   31 , 2009 , revenues and expenses related to securitized cardmember loans and related debt were reflected in other commissions and fees ( included in discount revenue , net card fees and other ) , interest income , interest expense and provisions for losses . in addition , there was no securitization income , net as this presentation assumed no securitization transactions had occurred . Â   table of contents historically , the company included uscs information on a managed basis , as that was the manner in which the company Â ’ s management viewed and managed the business . management believed that a full picture of trends in the company Â ’ s cardmember loans business could only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans , as the presentation of the entire cardmember loan portfolio was more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and related trends over time . the managed basis presentation also provided investors a more comprehensive assessment of the information necessary for the company and investors to evaluate the company Â ’ s market share . the adoption of new gaap on january Â   1 , 2010 resulted in accounting for both the company Â ’ s securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans in the consolidated financial statements . as a result , the company Â ’ s 2010 gaap presentations and managed basis presentations prior to 2010 are generally comparable . for additional information on the differences between the company Â ’ s historical gaap and managed basis presentations , see the company Â ’ s financial review included in the company Â ’ s annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december Â   31 , 2009 .

Â   table of contents results of operations for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 and 2009 Â — managed basisthe following discussion of u . s . card services is on a managed basis . discount revenue , net card fees and other increased $ 184 Â   million or 8 Â   percent and $ 207 Â   million or 4 percent as compared to the same period a year ago to $ 2 . 5 Â   billion and $ 4 . 9 Â   billion for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , respectively , reflecting higher billed business volumes and increased travel revenues partially offset by lower commissions and fees and decreased net card fees . interest income for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2010 decreased $ 214 Â   million or 14 Â   percent to $ 1 . 3 Â   billion , due to a decline of 11 Â   percent in the average managed loan portfolio balance and a lower portfolio yield . the lower yield was driven by higher payment rates , lower revolving levels and the card act , partially offset by repricing initiatives . interest income for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , decreased $ 617 Â   million or 18 Â   percent to $ 2 . 7 Â   billion primarily due to 13 percent decline in the average managed loan balances and a lower portfolio yield as compared to a year ago . interest expense increased $ 10 Â   million or 5 Â   percent as compared to a year ago to $ 204 Â   million for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2010 due to higher cost of funds , partially offset by reduced funding requirements due to a lower average cardmember loan balance . interest expense decreased $ 45 million or 10 Â   percent as compared to the same period a year ago to $ 394 Â   million for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , primarily due to lower average cardmember loan balances . provisions for losses decreased $ 1 . 5 Â   billion or 74 Â   percent to $ 519 Â   million for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , principally due to improving cardmember lending and charge card credit performance and a lower average loan balance . provisions for losses decreased $ 2 . 8 Â   billion or 70 percent to $ 1 . 2 Â   billion for the six months ended 2010 , principally due to improving cardmember loan and charge card credit performance and a lower average loan balance .

Â   ( c ) Â   effective january Â   1 , 2010 , the company revised the time period in which past due cardmember receivables in international card services are written off when they are 180 Â   days past due or earlier , consistent with applicable bank regulatory guidance and the write-off methodology adopted for u . s . card services in the fourth quarter of 2008 . previously , receivables were written off when they were 360 Â   days past billing or earlier . therefore , the net write-offs for the first quarter of 2010 include net write-offs of approximately $ 60 Â   million for international card services resulting from this write-off methodology change , which increased the net loss ratio and decreased the 90 Â   days past billing metric for this segment , but did not have a substantial impact on provisions for losses . Â   ( d ) Â   beginning with the first quarter of 2010 , the company has revised the net loss ratio to exclude write-offs related to unauthorized transactions , consistent with the methodology for calculation of the net write-off rate for u . s . card services . the metrics for prior periods have not been revised for this change as it was deemed immaterial .

Â   ( d ) Â   net interest yield on cardmember loans is a non-gaap financial measure that represents the net spread earned on cardmember loans . net interest yield on cardmember loans is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by adjusted average loans , computed on an annualized basis . the calculation of net interest yield on cardmember loans includes interest that is deemed uncollectible . for all net interest yield presentations , reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses Â — cardmember loans ; therefore , such reserves and net write-offs are not included in the net interest yield calculation . results of operations for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 and 2009international card services segment income increased more than 100 Â   percent or $ 82 Â   million to $ 160 million for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , from $ 78 Â   million for the same period a year ago as total revenues net of interest expense remained flat , provisions for losses decreased 70 Â   percent and expenses increased by 10 Â   percent . for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , international card services reported segment income of $ 311 Â   million , a $ 181 Â   million or more than 100 Â   percent increase from $ 130 Â   million for the same period a year ago . both the revenue and expense comparisons were influenced by the translation impact of a weaker dollar during the second quarter of 2010 . total revenues net of interest expense increased $ 90 Â   million or 4 Â   percent to $ 2 . 2 Â   billion for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 . the year over year increase is primarily due to increased discount revenue , other commissions and fees , net card fees and lower interest expense , partially offset by lower interest income . total revenues net of interest expense remained flat for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2010 . discount revenue , net card fees and other revenues of $ 865 Â   million and $ 1 . 7 Â   billion for three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , respectively , increased $ 27 Â   million or 3 Â   percent and $ 122 million or 8 Â   percent , driven primarily by the higher level of card spending , higher other commissions and fees , increased net card fees and slightly greater travel commissions and fees , partially offset by lower other revenues . the 12 Â   percent and 16 Â   percent increase in billed business for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , respectively , reflects an 18 percent and 23 Â   percent increase in average spending per proprietary basic cards-in-force partially offset by a 4 Â   percent decrease in basic cards-in-force , when compared to the prior year . Â   table of contents for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , assuming no changes in foreign currency exchange rates , billed business increased 9 Â   percent and 7 Â   percent , respectively , and average spending per proprietary basic cards-in-force increased 14 Â   percent , respectively . billed business outside the united states increased 15 Â   percent in latin america , 10 Â   percent in asia pacific , 7 Â   percent in canada and 7 percent in europe for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , and 13 Â   percent in latin america , 8 percent in asia pacific , 6 Â   percent in canada and 6 Â   percent in europe for the six months ended june 30 , 2010 . interest income of $ 342 Â   million and $ 705 Â   million for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , respectively , declined $ 34 Â   million or 9 Â   percent and $ 36 Â   million or 5 Â   percent as compared to the same periods a year ago , as a lower yield on cardmember loans and a lower average loan balance were partially offset by higher lending card fees . interest expense decreased $ 2 Â   million or 2 Â   percent and $ 4 Â   million or 2 Â   percent for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , due to a lower average loan balance , partially offset by a higher average receivable balance . provisions for losses of $ 90 Â   million and $ 248 Â   million decreased $ 212 Â   million or 70 Â   percent and $ 389 million or 61 Â   percent for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , respectively , primarily reflecting improving cardmember loans and charge card credit trends . expenses of $ 817 Â   million and $ 1 . 6 Â   billion increased $ 77 Â   million or 10 Â   percent and $ 194 Â   million or 14 Â   percent for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , respectively , due to higher marketing , promotion , rewards and cardmember services costs . marketing , promotion , rewards and cardmember services expenses of $ 376 Â   million and $ 726 Â   million for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , respectively , increased $ 89 Â   million or 31 Â   percent and $ 181 Â   million or 33 Â   percent as compared to the same periods a year ago , reflecting higher marketing and promotion expenses and greater rewards costs . salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased $ 12 Â   million or 3 Â   percent to $ 441 Â   million for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2010 reflecting lower salaries and employee benefits , partially offset by higher professional services expenses . salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased $ 13 Â   million or 1 Â   percent to $ 888 Â   million for the six months ended june 30 , 2010 driven by higher professional services expenses , partially offset by lower salaries and employee benefits . the effective tax rate was 20 Â   percent and 19 Â   percent for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , respectively . the effective tax rate was ( 10 ) Â   percent and ( 30 ) Â   percent for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2009 , respectively . the tax rates in all periods reflect the impact of recurring tax benefits on varying levels of pretax income . as indicated in previous quarters , this segment reflects the favorable impact of the company Â ’ s consolidated tax benefit related to its ongoing funding activities outside the united states , which is allocated to international card services under the company Â ’ s internal tax allocation process . the availability of this benefit in future years is largely dependent on a provision of the u . s . internal revenue code that congress has not yet acted to extend . refer to certain legislative , regulatory and other developments above for further discussion of this provision .

Â   table of contents expenses were $ 639 Â   million and $ 1 . 2 Â   billion for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , respectively , an increase of $ 122 Â   million or 24 Â   percent and $ 247 Â   million or 26 Â   percent , respectively , due to increased marketing and promotion and salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses . marketing and promotion expenses increased $ 115 Â   million or more than 100 Â   percent and $ 217 million or more than 100 Â   percent for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , respectively , reflecting higher brand , network and merchant-related marketing investments . salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased $ 7 Â   million or 2 Â   percent and $ 30 Â   million or 4 Â   percent for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , respectively , reflecting higher professional services and technology-related expenses , offset by lower salaries and employee benefits expense . the effective tax rate was 35 Â   percent and 36 Â   percent for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , respectively . the effective tax rate was 35 Â   percent for both the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2009 , respectively . corporate & otherresults of operations for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 and 2009corporate & other reported net expense of $ 51 Â   million and $ 104 Â   million for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 , respectively . segment income for the three and six months ended june Â   30 , 2009 was $ 111 Â   million and $ 178 Â   million , respectively . the net expense for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2010 reflected higher incentive compensation and benefit expense compared to prior year , partially offset by $ 93 Â   million and $ 43 Â   million of after-tax income related to the mastercard and visa litigation settlements , respectively , and $ 2 Â   million of after-tax benefit related to the company Â ’ s reengineering efforts . the income for the three months ended june Â   30 , 2009 , reflected $ 135 Â   million of after-tax income related to the icbc sale , $ 93 Â   million and $ 43 Â   million of after-tax income related to the mastercard and visa litigation settlements , respectively , and a $ 35 Â   million of after-tax expense related to the company Â ’ s reengineering initiatives . the net expense for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2010 reflected higher incentive compensation and benefit expense compared to prior year , partially offset by $ 186 Â   million and $ 86 Â   million of after-tax income related to the mastercard and visa litigation settlements , respectively , and $ 3 million of after-tax benefit related to the company Â ’ s reengineering efforts . the income for the six months ended june Â   30 , 2009 included $ 186 Â   million and $ 86 Â   million of after-tax income reflected the mastercard and visa litigation settlements , respectively . other reporting mattersaccounting developmentssee Â “ recently issued accounting standards Â ” section of note 1 to the consolidated financial statements .

and analysis of financial condition and results of operations , contains forward-looking statements regarding future events and our future results that are subject to the safe harbors created under the securities act of 1933 ( the Â “ securities act Â ” ) and the securities exchange act of 1934 ( the Â “ exchange act Â ” ) . all statements other than statements of historical facts are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements . these statements are based on current expectations , estimates , forecasts , and projections about the industries in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management . words such as Â “ expects , Â ” Â “ anticipates , Â ” Â “ targets , Â ” Â “ goals , Â ” Â “ projects , Â ” Â “ intends , Â ” Â “ plans , Â ” Â “ believes , Â ” Â “ seeks , Â ” Â “ estimates , Â ” Â “ continues , Â ” Â “ may , Â ” variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements . in addition , any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance , our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses , and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements . readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks , uncertainties , and assumptions that are difficult to predict , including those identified below , under Â “ part ii , item Â   1a . risk factors Â ” and elsewhere herein . therefore , actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements . we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason . overview our results for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 reflected increases in net sales , net income , and net income per diluted share from the corresponding period of fiscal 2007 , as we achieved balanced year-over-year revenue growth from our five geographic theaters , our customer markets , and our products and services . we believe this balance is attributable in part to the successful implementation of our strategy . net income decreased by 5 % and increased by 12 % during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 , respectively , compared with the corresponding periods of fiscal 2007 , while net income per diluted share decreased by 3 % and increased by 13 % during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 , respectively , compared with the corresponding periods of fiscal 2007 . our results for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 included an acquisition-related compensation charge of $ 246 million related to our agreement to purchase the minority interest in nuova systems . our results for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 included a net tax benefit of $ 162 million from a settlement of certain u . s . income tax matters which was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 . during the third quarter of fiscal 2008 , we observed unfavorable economic and market conditions , primarily in the united states , that may have resulted in reduced levels of information technology-related capital spending . as we enter the fourth quarter , we continue to see uncertain market conditions , especially in the united states , which could contribute to slower revenue growth . these conditions could adversely affect our operating results . however , we believe that our strategy and our ability to innovate and execute may enable us to improve our relative competitive position in difficult business conditions and may continue to provide us with long-term growth opportunities . revenue net sales increased by 10 . 4 % and 14 . 5 % during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 , respectively , compared with the corresponding periods of fiscal 2007 . revenue increased in each of our five geographic theaters , and in each of our customer markets , in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2008 compared with the corresponding periods of fiscal 2007 . during the third quarter of fiscal 2008 , we experienced slower year-over-year growth in sales to the service provider market in the united states and sales to the enterprise market were relatively flat year-over-year in the united states . revenue for the emerging markets theater significantly increased during the third quarter of fiscal 2008 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2007 , due to higher shipments and recognition of previously deferred revenue . net sales for the emerging markets theater may fluctuate in future periods due , among other things , to the impact of revenue recognition-related factors . revenue for the asia pacific , japan and european markets theaters increased during the third quarter of fiscal 2008 as we continued to see our customers invest in communications and information technology . the increase in our revenue also reflects balance across our products and services . the largest proportion of the increase in net product sales during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 was related to higher sales of advanced technologies . sales of our advanced technologies , which represented a larger proportion of our net product sales than routing , increased by approximately 17 % and 23 % during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 , respectively , due to strength in sales of our unified communications and video systems products . the increase in our sales of advanced technologies reflects our balanced product portfolio and our efforts to constantly innovate and evolve into new markets and product adjacencies . in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 , we also experienced strength in sales of our routing products , led by our high-end routers . the increase in switching revenue during both periods was led by higher sales of our fixed-configuration switches . we also have been focused on expanding our service model . in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 , our net service Â   27 table of contents revenue increased by approximately 15 % and 19 % , respectively , compared with the corresponding periods of fiscal 2007 . our service and support strategy seeks to capitalize on increased globalization , and we believe this strategy , along with our architectural approach , has the potential to further differentiate us from competitors . operating margin in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 , our gross margin percentage increased when compared with the corresponding periods of fiscal 2007 . the increase was primarily due to lower manufacturing costs and higher shipment volume , partially offset by higher sales discounts , rebates , and product pricing . operating expenses during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 increased in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue as compared with the corresponding periods of fiscal 2007 . our headcount increased during the first nine months of fiscal 2008 , reflecting investments in sales and research and development ( r & d ) , investments in our service business , and acquisitions . in addition , unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates increased our operating expenses . other financial highlights during the first nine months of fiscal 2008 , we generated cash flows from operations of $ 8 . 6 billion . our cash and cash equivalents and investments were $ 24 . 4 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2008 , compared with $ 22 . 3 billion at the end of fiscal 2007 . we repurchased 318 Â   million shares of our common stock during the first nine months of 2008 for $ 9 . 0 billion . days sales outstanding in accounts receivable ( dso ) at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2008 increased to 39 days , compared with 38 days at the end of fiscal 2007 . our inventory balance was $ 1 . 3 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2008 and at the end of fiscal 2007 . annualized inventory turns were 11 . 0 in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 , compared with 10 . 3 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 . our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers were $ 2 . 7 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2008 , compared with $ 2 . 6 billion at the end of fiscal 2007 . focus areas we believe our growth was attributable to the continued deployment by customers of our end-to-end architecture and the convergence of data , voice , video , and mobility into ip networks , together with our differentiated strategy and execution . in addition , our balance across product areas , customer markets and geographic segments contributed to our growth and strong financial position . we believe that video applications , including iptv , cisco telepresence , unified communications , physical security and other video products , have the potential to accelerate the growth of bandwidth demands and to increase loads on networks , which may require upgrades to existing networks . we delivered several new products during the quarter , and we are pleased with the breadth and depth of our innovation across all aspects of our business and the impact that we believe it will have on our long-term prospects . in addition , we have continued to focus on expanding our presence in the emerging markets theater . the investments we have made and our architectural approach are based on the belief that collaboration and networked web 2 . 0 technologies that enable user collaboration , including such technologies as unified communications and cisco telepresence , and the increased use of the network as the platform for all forms of communications and information technology will create new market opportunities for us . as part of the second major phase of the internet , we believe the industry is evolving as both personal and business process collaboration enabled by networked web 2 . 0 technologies help to increase innovation and productivity . we will endeavor to lead this market transition from products to processes through product development , in the marketplace , and through our own internal adoption and utilization . critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments , assumptions , and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes . note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended july Â   28 , 2007 describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements . the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates . such accounting policies require significant judgments , assumptions , and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements , and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies . revenue recognition our products are generally integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of the equipment . additionally , we provide unspecified software upgrades and enhancements related to the equipment through our maintenance contracts for most of our products . accordingly , we account for revenue in accordance with statement of position no . Â   97-2 , Â “ software revenue recognition , Â ” and all related interpretations . for sales of products where software is incidental to the equipment , or in hosting arrangements , we Â   28 table of contents apply the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no . Â   104 , Â “ revenue recognition , Â ” and all related interpretations . revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists , delivery has occurred , the fee is fixed or determinable , and collectibility is reasonably assured . in instances where final acceptance of the product , system , or solution is specified by the customer , revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met . contracts , internet commerce agreements , and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement . shipping documents and customer acceptance , when applicable , are used to verify delivery . we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment . we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis , as well as the customer Â ’ s payment history . when a sale involves multiple elements , such as sales of products that include services , the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each element are met . the amount of product and service revenue recognized is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and , if so , whether vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value exists . changes to the elements in an arrangement and our ability to establish vendor-specific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition . revenue deferrals relate to the timing of revenue recognition for specific transactions based on financing arrangements , service , support , and other factors . financing arrangements may include sales-type and operating leases , loans , and guarantees of third-party financing . our total deferred revenue for products was $ 2 . 9 billion and $ 2 . 2 billion as of april Â   26 , 2008 and july Â   28 , 2007 , respectively . technical support services revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed , which is typically from one to three years . advanced services revenue is recognized upon delivery or completion of performance . our total deferred revenue for services was $ 5 . 7 billion and $ 4 . 8 billion as of april Â   26 , 2008 and july Â   28 , 2007 , respectively . we make sales to distributors and retail partners and recognize revenue based on a sell-through method using information provided by them . our distributors and retail partners participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs , and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs . if actual credits received by our distributors and retail partners for these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates , which are based on historical experience , our revenue could be adversely affected . allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns our accounts receivable balance , net of allowance for doubtful accounts , was $ 4 . 2 billion and $ 4 . 0 billion as of april Â   26 , 2008 and july Â   28 , 2007 , respectively . the allowance for doubtful accounts was $ 183 million , or 4 . 2 % of the gross accounts receivable balance , as of april Â   26 , 2008 , and $ 166 million , or 4 . 0 % of the gross accounts receivable balance , as of july Â   28 , 2007 . the allowance is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts . we regularly review the allowance by considering factors such as historical experience , credit quality , age of the accounts receivable balances , and current economic conditions that may affect a customer Â ’ s ability to pay . our provision for doubtful accounts was $ 34 million and $ 6 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 and 2007 , respectively . if a major customer Â ’ s creditworthiness deteriorates , or if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience , or if other circumstances arise , our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated , and additional allowances could be required , which could have an adverse impact on our revenue . a reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates . the reserve for future sales returns as of april Â   26 , 2008 and july Â   28 , 2007 was $ 88 million and $ 74 million , respectively , and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable . if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established , our revenue could be adversely affected . inventory valuation and liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers our inventory balance was $ 1 . 3 billion as of april Â   26 , 2008 and july Â   28 , 2007 . inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts . inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market based upon assumptions about future demand , and are charged to the provision for inventory , which is a component of our cost of sales . at the point of the loss recognition , a new , lower cost basis for that inventory is established , and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis . in addition , we record a liability for firm , non-cancelable , and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory . as of april Â   26 , 2008 , the liability for these purchase commitments was $ 176 million , compared with $ 168 million as of july Â   28 , 2007 , and was included in other current liabilities . our provision for inventory was $ 83 million and $ 173 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 and 2007 , respectively . the provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was $ 75 million and $ 24 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 and 2007 , respectively . if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products , or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer Â   29 table of contents requirements , we could be required to increase our inventory write-downs and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers and gross margin could be adversely affected . inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence . warranty costs the liability for product warranties , included in other current liabilities , was $ 379 million as of april Â   26 , 2008 , compared with $ 340 million as of july Â   28 , 2007 . see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements . our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years , and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty . we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs , technical support labor costs , and associated overhead . material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment . technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer cases and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period . overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activities . the provision for product warranties issued during the first nine months of fiscal 2008 and 2007 was $ 376 million and $ 384 million , respectively . if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience , or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected , our gross margin could be adversely affected . share-based compensation expense share-based compensation expense recognized under sfas 123 ( r ) was as follows ( in millions ) : Â   Â   Â   Â   three Â   months Â   ended Â   Â   nine Â   months Â   ended Â   Â   Â   april Â   26 , Â   Â   april Â   28 , Â   Â   april Â   26 , Â   Â   april Â   28 , employee share-based compensation expense Â   Â   $ 268 Â   Â   $ 237 Â   Â   $ 767 Â   Â   $ 709 share-based compensation expense related to acquisitions and investments Â   Â   Â   22 Â   Â   Â   8 Â   Â   Â   67 Â   Â   Â   27 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   total Â   Â   $ 290 Â   Â   $ 245 Â   Â   $ 834 Â   Â   $ 736 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   upon adoption of sfas 123 ( r ) , we began estimating the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a lattice-binomial model . prior to the adoption of sfas 123 ( r ) , the value of each employee stock option was estimated on the date of grant using the black-scholes model . see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information . the determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables . these variables include , but are not limited to , the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards , and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors . the use of a lattice-binomial model requires extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and a number of complex assumptions including expected volatility , risk-free interest rate , expected dividends , kurtosis , and skewness . the weighted-average assumptions , using the lattice-binomial model , and the weighted-average estimated value of employee stock options are summarized as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   three Â   months Â   ended Â   Â   nine months ended Â   Â   Â   Â   april Â   26 , 2008 Â   Â   april Â   28 , 2007 Â   Â   april Â   26 , 2008 Â   Â   april Â   28 , 2007 Â   weighted-average assumptions : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   expected Â   volatility Â   Â   Â   35 . 3 % Â   Â   26 . 3 % Â   Â   31 . 0 % Â   Â   25 . 8 % risk-free Â   interest Â   rate Â   Â   Â   3 . 1 % Â   Â   4 . 6 % Â   Â   4 . 3 % Â   Â   4 . 6 % expected Â   dividend Â   Â   Â   0 . 0 % Â   Â   0 . 0 % Â   Â   0 . 0 % Â   Â   0 . 0 % kurtosis Â   Â   Â   4 . 6 Â   Â   Â   4 . 6 Â   Â   Â   4 . 6 Â   Â   Â   4 . 5 Â   skewness Â   Â   Â   ( 0 . 80 ) Â   Â   ( 0 . 80 ) Â   Â   ( 0 . 80 ) Â   Â   ( 0 . 80 ) weighted-average estimated value ( per option share ) Â   Â   $ 6 . 98 Â   Â   $ 8 . 21 Â   Â   $ 9 . 75 Â   Â   $ 7 . 01 Â   we used the implied volatility for two-year traded options on our stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the lattice-binomial model consistent with sfas 123 ( r ) and sab 107 . the selection of the implied volatility approach was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our stock and also upon our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility . the risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock options . the dividend yield assumption is based on the history and expectation of dividend payouts . the estimated kurtosis and skewness are technical measures of the distribution of stock price returns , which affect expected employee Â   30 table of contents exercise behaviors that are based on our stock price return history as well as consideration of various academic analyses . because share-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest , it has been reduced for forfeitures . if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas 123 ( r ) in future periods , the compensation expense that we record under sfas 123 ( r ) may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period . investment impairments our fixed income and publicly traded equity securities are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at a fair value of $ 18 . 3 billion as of april Â   26 , 2008 , compared with $ 18 . 5 billion as of july Â   28 , 2007 . see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements . we recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our fixed income or publicly traded equity securities below their cost basis are judged to be other-than-temporary . the ultimate value realized on these securities , to the extent unhedged , is subject to market price volatility until they are sold . we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge , including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis , the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee , and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value . our ongoing consideration of these factors could result in additional impairment charges in the future , which could adversely affect our net income . there were no impairment charges on investments in fixed income or publicly held companies during the first nine months of either fiscal 2008 or fiscal 2007 . we also have investments in privately held companies , some of which are in the startup or development stages . as of april Â   26 , 2008 , our investments in privately held companies were $ 678 million , compared with $ 643 million as of july Â   28 , 2007 , and were included in other assets . see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements . we monitor these investments for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required , based primarily on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies . these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize . our impairment charges on investments in privately held companies were not material during the first nine months of either fiscal 2008 or fiscal 2007 . goodwill impairments our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques . goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed . we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit . the goodwill recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as of april Â   26 , 2008 and july Â   28 , 2007 was $ 12 . 4 billion and $ 12 . 1 billion , respectively . in response to changes in industry and market conditions , we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring , disposing of , or otherwise exiting businesses , which could result in an impairment of goodwill . there was no impairment of goodwill in the first nine months of fiscal 2008 or fiscal 2007 . income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions . our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign operations , r & d tax credits , state taxes , non-deductible compensation , and tax audit settlements . the effective tax rate was 23 . 2 % in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 and 20 . 2 % for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 . the effective tax rate was 22 . 5 % in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and 22 . 0 % for the first nine months of fiscal 2007 . effective at the beginning of the first quarter of 2008 , we adopted financial interpretation no . Â   48 , Â “ accounting for uncertainty in income taxes-an interpretation of fasb statement no . Â   109 Â ” ( Â “ fin 48 Â ” ) , which is a change in accounting for income taxes . fin 48 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no . Â   109 , Â “ accounting for income taxes . Â ” the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit , including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes , if any . the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 % likely of being realized upon settlement . as a result of the implementation of fin 48 , we reduced the liability for net unrecognized tax benefits by $ 451 Â   million , and accounted for the reduction as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle that resulted in an increase to retained earnings of $ 202 Â   million and an increase to additional paid-in capital of $ 249 million . see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information . significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes . although we believe our reserves are reasonable , no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals . we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances , such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate . to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded , such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made . the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate , as well as the related net interest . Â   31 table of contentssignificant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets . in assessing the need for a valuation allowance , we consider all available evidence , including past operating results , estimates of future taxable income , and the feasibility of tax planning strategies . in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized , we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding effect to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made . our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries Â   that have higher tax rates ; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities ; by expiration of or lapses in the r & d tax credit laws ; by transfer pricing adjustments including the post-acquisition integration of purchased intangible assets from certain acquisitions into Â   our intercompany r & d cost sharing arrangement ; by tax effects of non-deductible compensation ; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments ; or by changes in tax laws , regulations , accounting principles , including accounting for uncertain tax positions , Â   or interpretations thereof . significant judgment will be required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in fin 48 . in addition , fin 48 applies to all income tax positions , including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes , which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes or additional paid-in capital . further , as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments , our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates , and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax . our failure to meet these commitments could adversely affect our provision for income taxes . in addition , we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities . we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes . there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition . loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business . we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability , as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss , in determining loss contingencies . an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated . we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required . third parties , including customers , have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent , copyright , trademark , and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us . these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions , particularly in the united states . if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful , or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions , our business , operating results , and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected . net sales the following table presents the breakdown of net sales between product and service revenue ( in millions , except percentages ) : Â   Â   Â   Â   three

the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 , net sales increased across our five geographic theaters compared with the corresponding periods of fiscal 2007 , as we experienced increased information technology-related capital spending . our sales also benefited from our entry into new markets and the development of adjacent product offerings . during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 , we enhanced our methodology for attributing certain revenue transactions including revenue deferrals , and the associated cost of sales , to each geographic theater . as a result , we have reclassified prior period net sales and net product sales by theater to conform to the current period Â ’ s presentation . net sales by theater in a particular period may be significantly impacted by a number of revenue recognition-related factors , including the complexity of transactions such as multiple element arrangements , the mix of financings provided to our channel partners and customers , and final acceptance of the product , system , or solution , among other factors . in addition , certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases and the net sales related to these

fiscal 2008 increased compared with the corresponding periods of fiscal 2007 ; however , during the third quarter of fiscal 2008 , we experienced slower growth in net product sales due to unfavorable economic and market conditions . Â   33 table of contentsduring the third quarter of fiscal 2008 , we experienced slower year-over-year growth in sales to the service provider market in the united states due to lower spending by a few large customers , after experiencing higher year-over-year growth during the first six months of fiscal 2008 . in the enterprise market , our product sales were relatively flat during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 compared with the corresponding periods in fiscal 2007 . our overall growth in the united states continues to be slower due to the uncertain macroeconomic environment and its impact on information technology spending . sales to the u . s . federal government increased in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 compared with the corresponding periods of fiscal 2007 . the commercial market experienced an increase in net product sales in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 compared with the corresponding periods of fiscal 2007 due to the contribution of sales from webex , which we acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 . european markets the increase in net product sales in the european markets theater during the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2008 compared with the corresponding periods of fiscal 2007 was attributable to growth across our customer markets . during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 , we experienced strong growth in germany . net product sales to our service provider market increased in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 , which represented an improvement from the weakness we experienced during the second quarter of fiscal 2008 compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2007 . emerging markets during the third quarter of fiscal 2008 , net product sales in the emerging markets theater increased compared with the corresponding period of fiscal 2007 due to increased shipments and recognition of previously deferred revenue . we experienced continued network deployment across our customer markets . for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 , net product sales in the emerging markets theater increased compared with the corresponding period of fiscal 2007 due to increased shipments and recognition of previously deferred revenue . the increase in net product sales for this theater in the first nine months of fiscal 2008 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2007 was primarily attributable to increased sales in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2008 compared with the corresponding periods of fiscal 2007 . net product sales for the emerging markets theater in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 experienced slower year-over-year growth , due to the negative impacts of the timing of revenue recognition and reserves related to our credit exposures to a brazilian importer of our products . the emerging markets theater had more revenue deferrals during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2007 due to greater levels of financing arrangements , service , support , and other factors . certain of our customers in the emerging markets theater tend to make large and sporadic purchases , and the net sales related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition . further , some customers may continue to require greater levels of financing arrangements , service , and support in future periods which may also impact the timing of recognition of the revenue for this theater . as a result , net sales in this theater may continue to fluctuate from period to period and such changes may or may not be indicative of a trend in future revenue for this theater . asia pacific the increase in net product sales in the asia pacific theater during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 compared with the corresponding periods of fiscal 2007 was primarily attributable to the balanced growth in the service provider and commercial markets , with china and india experiencing strong growth during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 . japan net product sales in the japan theater increased during the third quarter of fiscal 2008 compared with the corresponding period of fiscal 2007 primarily due to the next generation service provider network build-outs . the decrease in the net product sales in the japan theater was not significant for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2007 .

product sales related to routers in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 compared with the corresponding periods of fiscal 2007 was primarily due to higher sales of our high-end routers , with strength in our cisco crs-1 carrier routing system and cisco 7600 series routers . sales of our high-end routers , which represent a larger proportion of our total router sales compared with midrange and low-end routers , increased by approximately $ 265 million and $ 785 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 , respectively , compared with the corresponding periods of fiscal 2007 . our high-end router sales are primarily to service providers , which tend to make large and sporadic purchases . we believe that the increase in high-end router sales is attributable to service providers scaling their network capacity to accommodate actual and projected increases in data , voice and video traffic . during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 , our sales of our integrated services routers ( isrs ) , which are included in the midrange and low-end routers , also increased and contributed to growth in sales of our advanced technologies products , such as security , unified communications , and wireless . switches the increase in net product sales related to switches in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 was primarily due to higher sales of local-area network ( lan ) fixed-configuration switches , which increased during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 by approximately $ 160 million and $ 655 million , respectively , compared with the corresponding periods of fiscal 2007 . the increase in sales of lan fixed-configuration switches was a result of the continued adoption by our customers of new technologies throughout their networks from the data center to the wiring closet , including gigabit ethernet , 10 gigabit ethernet , and power over ethernet , which leads to the higher sales of cisco catalyst 2960 and 3560 series switches . additionally , growth in advanced technologies such as unified communications and wireless lans creates demand for lan fixed-configuration infrastructure as additional endpoints are added to the network . net product sales related to our modular switches decreased by approximately $ 55 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2008 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2007 primarily due to the decreased sales of the high-end cisco catalyst 6500 series switches . net product sales related to our modular switches increased slightly during the first nine months of fiscal 2008 compared with the corresponding period of fiscal 2007 . advanced technologies the increase in net product sales related to advanced technologies in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 compared with the corresponding periods of fiscal 2007 was due to the following : Â   Â   Â • Â   sales of unified communications increased by approximately $ 190 million and $ 680 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 , respectively , due to the contribution of sales from webex and due to sales of ip phones and associated software as our customers continued to transition from an analog-based to an ip-based infrastructure . Â   Â   Â • Â   sales of video systems , which include solutions and systems designed to enable video-specific delivery systems for service providers , increased by approximately $ 50 million and $ 315 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 , respectively . the increase was attributable to several factors , including an increase in the demand for high-definition set-top boxes , network upgrades , and international growth . our sales of video systems grew at a slower year-over-year rate in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 as compared with the year-over-year rate in the corresponding period in 2007 , as our sales of video systems products in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 benefited from the new u . s . federal communications commission ( fcc ) requirements effective july Â   1 , 2007 , which required separable security for set-top boxes sold in the united states . Â   35 table of contents Â   Â • Â   sales of security products increased by approximately $ 40 million and $ 135 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 , respectively , primarily due to the contribution of sales from ironport systems , inc . which we acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 , and due to module and line card sales related to our routers and lan switches as customers continued to emphasize network security , and also due to sales of our next-generation adaptive security appliance products , which integrate multiple technologies including virtual private network ( vpn ) , firewall , and intrusion prevention services on one platform . Â   Â   Â • Â   sales of application networking services increased by approximately $ 30 million and $ 95 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 , respectively . the increase was primarily due to higher demand from customers for wide area network ( wan ) optimization solutions . Â   Â   Â • Â   sales of storage area networking products increased by approximately $ 5 million and $ 65 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 , respectively . this increase was primarily due to the continuing build-out of the cisco mds 9000 products in customer data centers . Â   Â   Â • Â   sales of wireless lan products increased by approximately $ 15 million and $ 40 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 , respectively , primarily due to new customers , continued deployments with existing customers , and customers Â ’ adoption of our unified architecture platform . Â   Â   Â • Â   home networking product sales increased by approximately $ 15 million in the third quarter and decreased by approximately $ 15 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2008 , respectively . other product revenue the increase in other product revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2007 was primarily due to an increase in sales of cable products . the increase in other product revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2008 compared with the corresponding period of fiscal 2007 was primarily due to an increase in sales of optical networking and cable products . other product revenue also includes sales of emerging technology products . factors that may impact net product sales net product sales may continue to be affected by changes in the geopolitical environment and global economic conditions ; challenges that are currently affecting economic conditions in the united states ; competition , including price-focused competitors from asia , especially china ; new product introductions ; sales cycles and product implementation cycles ; changes in the mix of our customers between service provider and enterprise markets ; changes in the mix of direct sales and indirect sales ; variations in sales channels ; and final acceptance criteria of the product , system , or solution as specified by the customer . sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases , especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain advanced technologies . in addition , service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles , require a broader range of services , including network design services , and often have acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition . certain of our customers in the emerging markets theater also tend to make large and sporadic purchases and the net sales related to these transactions may similarly be affected by the timing of revenue recognition . as we focus on new market opportunities , customers may require greater levels of financing arrangements , service , and support , especially in the emerging markets theater , which may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition . to improve customer satisfaction , we continue to focus on managing our manufacturing lead-time performance , which may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog . a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quarter-to-quarter net sales and operating results . net product sales may also be adversely affected by fluctuations in demand for our products , especially with respect to internet businesses and telecommunications service providers , price and product competition in the communications and information technology industry , introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products , adoption of new networking standards , and financial difficulties experienced by our customers . we may , from time to time , experience manufacturing issues that create a delay in our suppliers Â ’ ability to provide specific components , resulting in delayed shipments . to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages , including those caused by any possible disruption related to our implementation of the lean manufacturing model , result in delayed shipments in the future , and particularly in periods when we and our suppliers are operating at higher levels of capacity , it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters are not remediated within the same quarter . for additional factors that may impact net product sales , see Â “ part ii , item Â   1a . risk factors . Â ” our distributors and retail partners participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs . in addition , increasing sales to our distributors and retail partners generally results in greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and , to a certain degree , the timing of orders from our customers . we recognize revenue for sales to our distributors and retail partners based on a sell-through method using information provided by them , and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for all cooperative marketing and other programs . Â   36 table of contentsnet service revenue the increase in net service revenue during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 compared with the corresponding periods of fiscal 2007 was primarily due to increased technical support service contract initiations and renewals associated with higher product sales , which have resulted in a larger installed base of equipment being serviced , and increased revenue from advanced services , which relates to consulting support services for specific networking needs . the increase in advanced services revenue in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 , compared with the corresponding periods of fiscal 2007 , was attributable primarily to our revenue growth in our service provider market , the emerging markets theater , and advanced technologies products . gross margin the following table presents the gross margin for products and services ( in millions , except percentages ) : Â   Â   Â   Â   three months ended Â   Â   nine months ended Â   Â   Â   Â   amount Â   Â   percentage Â   Â   amount Â   Â   percentage Â   Â   Â   Â   april Â   26 , Â   Â   april Â   28 , Â   Â   april Â   26 , Â   Â   april Â   28 , 2007 Â   Â   april Â   26 , Â   Â   april Â   28 , Â   Â   april Â   26 , Â   Â   april Â   28 , Â   gross margin : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   product Â   Â   $ 5 , 334 Â   Â   $ 4 , 796 Â   Â   65 . 1 % Â   64 . 1 % Â   $ 15 , 889 Â   Â   $ 13 , 792 Â   Â   65 . 0 % Â   64 . 1 % service Â   Â   Â   971 Â   Â   Â   851 Â   Â   61 . 0 % Â   61 . 4 % Â   Â   2 , 929 Â   Â   Â   2 , 476 Â   Â   62 . 1 % Â   62 . 4 % Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   total Â   Â   $ 6 , 305 Â   Â   $ 5 , 647 Â   Â   64 . 4 % Â   63 . 7 % Â   $ 18 , 818 Â   Â   $ 16 , 268 Â   Â   64 . 5 % Â   63 . 8 % Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   the following table presents the gross margin for each theater ( in millions , except percentages ) : Â   Â   Â   Â   three months ended Â   Â   nine months ended Â   Â   Â   Â   amount Â   Â   percentage Â   Â   amount Â   Â   percentage Â   Â   Â   Â   april Â   26 , Â   Â   april Â   28 , Â   Â   april Â   26 , Â   Â   april Â   28 , Â   Â   april Â   26 , Â   Â   april Â   28 , Â   Â   april Â   26 , Â   Â   april Â   28 , Â   gross margin : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   united states and canada Â   Â   $ 3 , 311 Â   Â   $ 3 , 130 Â   Â   64 . 8 % Â   64 . 3 % Â   $ 10 , 452 Â   Â   $ 9 , 118 Â   Â   65 . 9 % Â   64 . 4 % european markets Â   Â   Â   1 , 431 Â   Â   Â   1 , 272 Â   Â   66 . 6 % Â   64 . 8 % Â   Â   3 , 976 Â   Â   Â   3 , 562 Â   Â   65 . 8 % Â   65 . 5 % emerging markets Â   Â   Â   717 Â   Â   Â   484 Â   Â   63 . 7 % Â   62 . 1 % Â   Â   1 , 975 Â   Â   Â   1 , 464 Â   Â   61 . 4 % Â   63 . 3 % asia pacific Â   Â   Â   682 Â   Â   Â   599 Â   Â   65 . 8 % Â   65 . 0 % Â   Â   1 , 997 Â   Â   Â   1 , 661 Â   Â   65 . 2 % Â   64 . 2 % japan Â   Â   Â   258 Â   Â   Â   233 Â   Â   70 . 1 % Â   70 . 4 % Â   Â   707 Â   Â   Â   683 Â   Â   70 . 6 % Â   69 . 2 % Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   theater total Â   Â   Â   6 , 399 Â   Â   Â   5 , 718 Â   Â   65 . 4 % Â   64 . 5 % Â   Â   19 , 107 Â   Â   Â   16 , 488 Â   Â   65 . 5 % Â   64 . 7 % Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   unallocated corporate items Â   Â   Â   ( 94 ) Â   Â   ( 71 ) Â   Â   Â   Â   ( 289 ) Â   Â   ( 220 ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   total Â   Â   $ 6 , 305 Â   Â   $ 5 , 647 Â   Â   64 . 4 % Â   63 . 7 % Â   $ 18 , 818 Â   Â   $ 16 , 268 Â   Â   64 . 5 % Â   63 . 8 % Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 , we enhanced our methodology for attributing certain revenue transactions including revenue deferrals , and the associated cost of sales to each geographic theater . as a result , we have reclassified prior period gross margin amounts by theater to conform to the current period Â ’ s presentation . for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 , the decrease in the gross margin percentage for the emerging markets theater from the corresponding period of fiscal 2007 was primarily due to higher sales discounts and reserves recorded relating to credit exposures to a brazilian importer of our products , which along with other factors , were partially offset by higher shipment volume and lower overall manufacturing costs . the gross margin for each theater is derived from information from our internal management system . the gross margin percentage for a particular theater may fluctuate and period-to-period changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that theater . Â   37 table of contentsproduct gross margin the increase in total product gross margin percentage during the third quarter of fiscal 2008 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2007 was due to the following factors : Â   Â   Â • Â   lower overall manufacturing costs related to lower component costs and value engineering , partially offset by other manufacturing-related costs , increased product gross margin percentage by 1 . 3 % . value engineering is the process by which production costs are reduced through component redesign , board configuration , test processes , and transformation processes . Â   Â   Â • Â   higher shipment volume , net of certain variable costs , increased product gross margin percentage by 0 . 4 % . Â   Â   Â • Â   changes in the mix of products sold increased product gross margin percentage by 0 . 4 % . Â   Â   Â • Â   sales discounts , rebates , and product pricing decreased product gross margin percentage by 0 . 9 % . Â   Â   Â • Â   net effects of amortization of purchased intangible assets and share-based compensation expense decreased product gross margin percentage by 0 . 2 % . the increase in total product gross margin percentage during the first nine months of fiscal 2008 compared with the first nine months of fiscal 2007 was due to the following factors : Â   Â   Â • Â   lower overall manufacturing costs related to lower component costs and value engineering , partially offset by other manufacturing-related costs , increased product gross margin percentage by 1 . 7 % . Â   Â   Â • Â   higher shipment volume , net of certain variable costs , increased product gross margin percentage by 0 . 5 % . Â   Â   Â • Â   changes in the mix of products sold increased product gross margin percentage by 0 . 1 % .

on the grant date fair value using the black-scholes model , and compensation expense for share-based payment awards granted subsequent to july Â   30 , 2005 based on the grant date fair value using the lattice-binomial model . in conjunction with the adoption of sfas 123 ( r ) , we changed our method of attributing the value of share-based compensation to expense from the accelerated multiple-option approach to the straight-line single-option method . compensation expense for all share-based payment awards granted on or prior to july Â   30 , 2005 is recognized using the accelerated multiple-option approach , whereas compensation expense for all share-based payment awards granted subsequent to july Â   30 , 2005 is recognized using the straight-line single-option method . employee share-based compensation expense for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 increased compared with the corresponding periods of fiscal 2007 primarily due to the

third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 compared with the corresponding periods of fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the additional amortization of purchased intangible assets related to recent acquisitions . for additional information regarding purchased intangibles , see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements . our methodology for allocating the purchase price , relating to purchase acquisitions , to in-process r & d is determined through established valuation techniques . see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the acquisitions completed in the first nine months of fiscal 2008 and the in-process r & d recorded for these acquisitions . in-process r & d was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed . the fair value of the existing purchased technology and patents , as well as the technology under development , is typically determined using the income approach , which discounts expected future cash flows to present value . the discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and venture capital surveys , adjusted upward to reflect additional risks inherent in the development lifecycle . we consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications industry . however , we do not expect to achieve a material amount of expense reductions as a result of

Â   40 table of contentsfor purchase acquisitions completed to date , the development of these technologies remains a significant risk due to the remaining efforts to achieve technological feasibility , rapidly changing customer markets , uncertain standards for new products , and significant competitive threats . the nature of the efforts to develop these technologies into commercially viable products consists primarily of planning , designing , experimenting , and testing activities necessary to determine that the technologies can meet market expectations , including functionality and technical requirements . failure to bring these products to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets and could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results . the key assumptions for calculating in-process r & d primarily consist of an expected completion date for the in-process projects ; estimated costs to complete the projects ; revenue and expense projections , assuming the products have entered the market ; and discount rates based on the risks associated with the development lifecycle of the in-process technology acquired . failure to achieve the expected levels of revenue and net income from these products will negatively affect the return on investment expected at the time that the acquisitions were completed and may result in impairment charges . actual results from the purchase acquisitions to date did not have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results . interest income , net the components of interest income , net , are as follows ( in millions ) : Â   Â   Â   Â   three Â   months Â   ended Â   Â   nine Â   months Â   ended Â   Â   Â   Â   april Â   26 , Â   Â   april Â   28 , Â   Â   april Â   26 , Â   Â   april Â   28 , Â   interest income Â   Â   $ 269 Â   Â   $ 283 Â   Â   $ 891 Â   Â   $ 801 Â   interest expense Â   Â   Â   ( 68 ) Â   Â   ( 94 ) Â   Â   ( 255 ) Â   Â   ( 283 ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   total Â   Â   $ 201 Â   Â   $ 189 Â   Â   $ 636 Â   Â   $ 518 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   the decrease in interest income during the third quarter of fiscal 2008 was due to lower interest rates partially offset by higher average total cash and cash equivalents and fixed income security balances during the third quarter of fiscal 2008 when compared with the corresponding period of fiscal 2007 . the increase in interest income during the first nine months of fiscal 2008 was primarily due to higher average total cash and cash equivalents and fixed income security balances in fiscal 2008 when compared with the corresponding period of fiscal 2007 , partially offset by lower interest rates . the decrease in interest expense in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 compared with the corresponding periods of fiscal 2007 was due to lower interest rates . interest expense includes the effect of $ 6 . 0 billion of interest rate swaps prior to the termination of the interest rate swaps , and following the termination , includes the amortization of the hedge accounting adjustment of the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt . other income ( loss ) , net the components of other income ( loss ) , net , are as follows ( in millions ) : Â   Â   Â   Â   three Â   months Â   ended Â   Â   nine months ended Â   Â   Â   Â   april Â   26 , Â   Â   april Â   28 , 2007 Â   Â   april Â   26 , 2008 Â   Â   april Â   28 , Â   net gains ( losses ) on investments in fixed income and publicly traded equity securities Â   Â   $ ( 12 ) Â   $ 64 Â   Â   $ 107 Â   Â   $ 191 Â   net gains ( losses ) on investments in privately held companies Â   Â   Â   18 Â   Â   Â   ( 9 ) Â   Â   11 Â   Â   Â   ( 23 ) impairment charges on investments in privately held companies Â   Â   Â   ( 1 ) Â   Â   Â — Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( 9 ) Â   Â   ( 14 ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   net gains ( losses ) and impairment charges on investments Â   Â   Â   5 Â   Â   Â   55 Â   Â   Â   109 Â   Â   Â   154 Â   other Â   Â   Â   ( 38 ) Â   Â   ( 22 ) Â   Â   ( 89 ) Â   Â   ( 60 ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   total Â   Â   $ ( 33 ) Â   $ 33 Â   Â   $ 20 Â   Â   $ 94 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2008 , our net gains on investments decreased compared with the corresponding periods of fiscal 2007 as a result of market conditions during the third quarter of fiscal 2008 . provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 23 . 2 % for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 , compared with an effective tax rate of 22 . 5 % for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 , and 20 . 2 % for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 , compared with 22 . 0 % for the first nine months of fiscal 2007 .

Â   24 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â — ( continued ) Â   consumer products revenues are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior , which generally results in increased revenues during the company Â ’ s first fiscal quarter , and by the timing and performance of theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts . interactive media revenues fluctuate due to the timing and performance of video game releases which are determined by several factors , including theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts ,

from subscriber growth , and 1 % from favorable foreign currency translation impacts at cable networks , and 1 % due to new contractual provisions at broadcasting . advertising revenues reflected increases of $ 13 million at cable networks ( from $ 846 million to $ 859 million ) and $ 7 million at broadcasting ( from $ 1 , 047 million to $ 1 , 054 million ) . higher cable networks advertising revenue was driven by an 8 % increase due to higher rates , partially offset by a 5 % decrease due to fewer units sold and lower ratings . at broadcasting an increase of 5 % due to higher network advertising rates was largely offset by decreases of 3 % due to lower network primetime ratings and 2 % due to lower political advertising at our owned television stations . other revenues reflected lower sales of abc studios productions driven by lost ghost whisperer costs and expenses operating expenses include programming and production costs which decreased $ 78 million from $ 2 , 003 million to $ 1 , 925 million . at cable networks , an increase in programming and production costs of $ 17 million was driven by more episodes of original programming at abc family and the disney channels largely offset by the absence of costs for the fifa world cup at espn which was broadcast in the prior year quarter . at broadcasting , programming and production costs decreased $ 95 million driven by a lower cost mix of primetime programming reflecting a shift in hours from original scripted programming to reality programming and lower news and daytime production costs due to cost savings initiatives . the decrease in programming and production costs was largely offset by a 1 % increase in operating costs due to the change in the transfer pricing arrangement for distribution of media networks home entertainment product and a 1 % increase due to higher labor costs . the increase in selling , general and administrative and other costs and expenses included the impact of higher marketing and sales expenses . equity in the income of investees income from equity investees increased to $ 184 million for the current quarter from $ 139 million in the prior-year quarter primarily due to lower cricket programming costs at espn star sports as a result of fewer matches airing in the current quarter and also decreased losses from our utv investment . segment operating income segment operating income increased 11 % , or $ 209 million , to $ 2 . 1 billion . the increase was primarily due to increases at espn , the abc television network and at the worldwide disney channels

, in combination with the facility that matures in 2013 , is used to support commercial paper borrowings . the new bank facility allows the company to issue up to $ 800 million of letters of credit , which if utilized , reduces available borrowings under this facility . as of july Â   2 , 2011 , $ 101 million of letters of credit had been issued under this facility . these bank facilities allow for borrowings at libor-based rates plus a spread , which depends on the company Â ’ s public debt rating and can range from 0 . 33 % to 4 . 50 % . the company may use commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused bank facilities , in conjunction with term debt issuance and operating cash flow , to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due . on december Â   1 ,

400 Â   million shares as of that date . as of july 2 , Â   42 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â — ( continued ) Â   2011 , the company had remaining authorization in place to repurchase approximately 363 Â   million additional shares . the repurchase program does not have an expiration date . we believe that the company Â ’ s financial condition is strong and that its cash balances , other liquid assets , operating cash flows , access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity , taken together , provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects . however , the company Â ’ s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control . in addition to macroeconomic factors , the company Â ’ s borrowing costs can be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies , which are based , in significant part , on the company Â ’ s performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios . as of july Â   2 , 2011 , moody Â ’ s investors service Â ’ s long- and short-term debt ratings for the company were a2 and p-1 , respectively , with stable outlook ; standard Â   & poor Â ’ s long- and short-term debt ratings for the company were a and a-1 , respectively , with stable outlook ; and fitch Â ’ s long- and short-term debt ratings for the company were a and f-1 , respectively , with stable outlook . the company Â ’ s bank facilities contain only one financial covenant , relating to interest coverage , which the company met on july Â   2 , 2011 , by a significant margin . the company Â ’ s bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities , such as disneyland paris , hong kong disneyland and shanghai disney resort , from any representations , covenants or events of default . disneyland paris has annual covenants under its debt agreements that limit its investment and financing activities and require it to meet certain financial performance covenants . disneyland paris was in compliance with these covenants for fiscal 2010 . commitments and contingencies legal matters as disclosed in note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements , the company has exposure for certain legal matters . guarantees see note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company

commitments refer to note 15 in the consolidated financial statements in the 2010 annual report on form 10-k for information regarding the company Â ’ s contractual commitments . other matters accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies , which are important to our financial position and results of operations , require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management . for a summary of our significant accounting policies , including the accounting policies Â   43 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â — ( continued ) Â   discussed below , see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2010 annual report on form 10-k . film and television revenues and costs we expense film and television production , participation and residual costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period Â ’ s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues ( ultimate revenues ) for each production . if our estimate of ultimate revenues decreases , amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated . conversely , if our estimate of ultimate revenues increase , film and television cost amortization may be slowed . for film productions , ultimate revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial theatrical release . for television series , ultimate revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode , or if still in production , five years from delivery of the most recent episode , if later . with respect to films intended for theatrical release , the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues ( and therefore affecting future film cost amortization and / or impairment ) is domestic theatrical performance . revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the domestic theatrical release ( e . g . , the home entertainment or international theatrical markets ) have historically been highly correlated with domestic theatrical performance . domestic theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film , the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort . upon a film Â ’ s release and determination of domestic theatrical performance , the company Â ’ s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends . the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues for released films is the extent of home entertainment sales achieved . home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home video products as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products . with respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast , the most sensitive factor affecting estimates of ultimate revenues is the program Â ’ s rating and the strength of the advertising market . program ratings , which are an indication of market acceptance , directly affect the company Â ’ s ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program . in addition , television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the eventual sale of the program rights in the syndication , international and home entertainment markets . alternatively , poor ratings may result in a television series cancellation , which would require the immediate write-off of any unamortized production costs . a significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates . we expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired movies , series and other programs based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired or on a straight-line basis over the useful life , as appropriate . amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings . the number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the program Â ’ s ratings in previous airings , expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming . accordingly , planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary . we amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement . the estimated values of each year are based on our projection of revenues over the contract period which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue . if the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season Â ’ s relative value , we expense the related contractual Â   44 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â — ( continued ) Â   payments during the applicable season . if planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly , amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed . costs of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs . the net realizable values of television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology . a daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type . the company Â ’ s dayparts are : daytime , late night , primetime , news , children , and sports ( includes network and cable ) . the net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable channel . individual programs are written-off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program . estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions . if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections , film , television and programming cost write-downs may be required . revenue recognition the company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business . see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2010 annual report on form 10-k as for a summary of these revenue recognition policies . we reduce home entertainment and software product revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and for customer programs and sales incentives . these estimates are based upon historical return experience , current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products . if we underestimate the level of returns and concessions in a particular period , we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amount . conversely , if we overestimate the level of returns and concessions for a period , we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns and concessions are less than estimated . we recognize revenues from advance theme park ticket sales when the tickets are used . for non-expiring , multi-day tickets , we recognize revenue over a four-year time period based on estimated usage , which is derived from historical usage patterns . if actual usage is different than our estimated usage , revenues may not be recognized in the periods the related services are rendered . in addition , a change in usage patterns would impact the timing of revenue recognition . pension and postretirement medical plan actuarial assumptions the company Â ’ s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions . two critical assumptions , the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets , are important elements of expense and / or liability measurement which we evaluate annually . refer to the 2010 annual report on form 10-k for estimated impacts of changes in these assumptions . other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns , mortality , turnover and rate of compensation increase . the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date . a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense . the guideline for setting this rate is high-quality long-term corporate bond rates . the company Â ’ s discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality corporate bonds . the resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves . Â   45 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â — ( continued ) Â   to determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets , we consider the current and expected asset allocation , as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class . a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense . goodwill , intangible assets , long-lived assets and investments the company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require , on an interim basis . goodwill is allocated to various reporting units , which are generally an operating segment or one level below the operating segment . the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment . if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value , an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the goodwill . to determine the fair value of our reporting units , we generally use a present value technique ( discounted cash flow ) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate . Â   we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units . the discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses . we include in the projected cash flows an estimate of the revenue we believe the reporting unit would receive if the intellectual property developed by the reporting unit that is being used by other reporting units was licensed to an unrelated third party at its fair market value . these amounts are not necessarily the same as those included in segment operating results . we believe our estimates of fair value are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units . in times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy , the company Â ’ s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual . if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions , the impairment test results could differ , and we could be required to record impairment charges . the company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts . if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value , an impairment loss is recognized . fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values , as appropriate . the company tests long-lived assets , including amortizable intangible assets , for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances ( triggering events ) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable . once a triggering event has occurred , the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale . the impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group against the carrying value of the asset group . an asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments . if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows , an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the group Â ’ s long-lived assets and the carrying value of the group Â ’ s long-lived assets . the impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts , but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value . for assets held for sale , to the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset Â ’ s fair value less costs to sell , an impairment loss is recognized for the difference . determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions , including whether a triggering event has occurred , the identification of the asset groups , estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values . if we had Â   46 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â — ( continued ) Â   established different asset groups or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions , the impairment test results could differ , and we could be required to record impairment charges . the company has cost and equity investments . the fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies , as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments . in assessing potential impairment of these investments , we consider these factors , as well as the forecasted financial performance of the investees and market values , where available . if these forecasts are not met or market values indicate an other-than-temporary decline in value , impairment charges may be required . allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectibility of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business . in times of domestic or global economic turmoil , our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectibility of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods . if our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low , costs and expenses may increase in future periods , and if it is too high , cost and expenses may decrease in future periods . contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and , as required , have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims . these estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results , assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies . it is possible , however , that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings . see note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information on litigation exposure . income tax audits as a matter of course , the company is regularly audited by federal , state and foreign tax authorities . Â   from time to time , these audits result in proposed assessments . Â   our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel where appropriate and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings ( or negotiations ) with taxing and legal authorities . the tax benefits ultimately realized by the company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors , including the company Â ’ s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter , relevant legal precedents related to similar matters and the company Â ’ s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities . new accounting pronouncements see note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements . market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes , foreign currency fluctuations , commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments . Â   47 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â — ( continued ) Â   policies and procedures in the normal course of business , we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company Â ’ s exposure to changes in interest rates , foreign currencies , commodities , and the fair market value of certain investments in debt and equity securities using a variety of financial instruments . our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs . to achieve these objectives , we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company Â ’ s portfolio of borrowings . by policy , the company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages . our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges . accordingly , the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the u . s . dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets , liabilities , commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses . the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable , but not firmly committed , transactions . the company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities . the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro , japanese yen , canadian dollar and british pound . cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to u . s . dollar denominated borrowings . by policy , the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years . the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the u . s . dollar equivalent value of the related exposures . our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes . the amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities , such as fuel , oil and gasoline . it is the company Â ’ s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above . the company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes .

eps ) increased 2 % for the quarter driven by improved operating results . improved operating results reflected higher advertising revenues and increased fees from multi-channel video service providers ( mvsp ) ( affiliate fees ) at espn and increased guest spending at our domestic parks and resorts . these increases were partially offset by higher programming costs at espn , increased operating expenses at our domestic parks and resorts , lower unit sales at our worldwide home entertainment business , lower results at our theatrical business reflecting the performance of mars needs moms Â   21 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â – ( continued ) Â   the prior-year quarter included restructuring and impairment charges of $ 71 Â   million , a gain on the sale of an investment in a pay television service in europe of $ 48 Â   million , and an accounting gain related to the acquisition of the disney stores in japan of $ 22 Â   million , which collectively had no impact on eps . six-month results diluted eps increased 25 % for the six months driven by improved operating results . improved operating results reflected higher advertising revenues at espn and the owned television stations , increased affiliate fees , increased guest spending and volumes at our domestic and international parks and resorts and higher licensing revenue due to the strength of toy story in the current six months , the company recorded $ 12 Â   million of restructuring and impairment charges and gains on the sale of miramax and bass totaling $ 75 Â   million . the table below shows the pretax and after tax impact of these items .

Â   22 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â – ( continued ) Â   parks and resorts revenues fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities . peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods . studio entertainment revenues fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical , home entertainment , and television markets . release dates are determined by several factors , including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods . consumer products revenues are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior , which generally results in increased revenues during the company Â ’ s first fiscal quarter , and by the timing and performance of theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts . interactive media revenues fluctuate due to the timing and performance of video game releases which are determined by several factors , including theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts , competition and the timing of holiday periods . revenues from certain of our internet and mobile operations are subject to similar seasonal trends . business segment results the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment operating income , which is shown below along with segment revenues : Â   Â   Â   Â   quarter ended Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   six

received beginning in fiscal year 2014 . under applicable accounting rules , the company was required to reduce its existing deferred tax asset , which was established for the future deductibility of

Â   41 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â – ( continued ) Â   with respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast , the most sensitive factor affecting estimates of ultimate revenues is the program Â ’ s rating and the strength of the advertising market . program ratings , which are an indication of market acceptance , directly affect the company Â ’ s ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program . in addition , television series Â ’ with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the eventual sale of the program rights in the syndication , international and home entertainment markets . alternatively , poor ratings may result in a television series cancellation , which would require the immediate write-off of any unamortized production costs . a significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates . we expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired movies , series and other programs based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired or on a straight-line basis over the useful life , as appropriate . amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings . the number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the program Â ’ s ratings in previous airings , expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming . accordingly , planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary . we amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement . the estimated values of each year are based on our projection of revenues over the contract period which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue . if the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season Â ’ s relative value , we expense the related contractual payment during the applicable season . if planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly , amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed . costs of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs . the net realizable values of television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology . a daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type . the company Â ’ s dayparts are : daytime , late night , primetime , news , children , and sports ( includes network and cable ) . the net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable channel . individual programs are written-off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program . estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions . if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections , film , television and programming cost write-downs may be required . revenue recognition the company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business . see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2010 annual report on form 10-k as for a summary of these revenue recognition policies . we reduce home entertainment and software product revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and for customer programs and sales incentives . these estimates are based upon historical return experience , current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products . if we underestimate the level of returns and concessions in a particular period , we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amount . conversely , if we overestimate the level of returns and concessions for a period , we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns and concessions are less than estimated . we recognize revenues from advance theme park ticket sales when the tickets are used . for non-expiring , multi-day tickets , we recognize revenue over a three-year time period based on estimated Â   42 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â – ( continued ) Â   usage , which is derived from historical usage patterns . if actual usage is different than our estimated usage , revenues may not be recognized in the periods the related services are rendered . in addition , a change in usage patterns would impact the timing of revenue recognition . pension and postretirement medical plan actuarial assumptions the company Â ’ s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions . two critical assumptions , the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets , are important elements of expense and / or liability measurement which we evaluate annually . refer to the 2010 annual report on form 10-k for estimated impacts of changes in these assumptions . other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns , mortality , turnover and rate of compensation increase . the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date . a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense . the guideline for setting this rate is high-quality long-term corporate bond rates . the company Â ’ s discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality corporate bonds . the resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves . to determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets , we consider the current and expected asset allocation , as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class . a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense . goodwill , intangible assets , long-lived assets and investments the company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require , on an interim basis . goodwill is allocated to various reporting units , which are generally an operating segment or one level below the operating segment . the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment . if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value , an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the goodwill . to determine the fair value of our reporting units , we generally use a present value technique ( discounted cash flow ) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate . Â   we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units . the discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses . we include in the projected cash flows an estimate of the revenue we believe the reporting unit would receive if the intellectual property developed by the reporting unit that is being used by other reporting units was licensed to an unrelated third party at its fair market value . these amounts are not necessarily the same as those included in segment operating results . we believe our estimates of fair value are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units . in times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy , the company Â ’ s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual . if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions , the impairment test results could differ , and we could be required to record impairment charges . the company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts . if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair Â   43 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â – ( continued ) Â   value , an impairment loss is recognized . fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values , as appropriate . the company tests long-lived assets , including amortizable intangible assets , for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances ( triggering events ) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable . once a triggering event has occurred , the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale . the impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group against the carrying value of the asset group . an asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments . if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows , an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the group Â ’ s long-lived assets and the carrying value of the group Â ’ s long-lived assets . the impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts , but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value . for assets held for sale , to the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset Â ’ s fair value less costs to sell , an impairment loss is recognized for the difference . determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions , including whether a triggering event has occurred , the identification of the asset groups , estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values . if we had established different asset groups or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions , the impairment test results could differ , and we could be required to record impairment charges . the company has cost and equity investments . the fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies , as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments . in assessing potential impairment of these investments , we consider these factors , as well as the forecasted financial performance of the investees and market values , where available . if these forecasts are not met or market values indicate an other-than-temporary decline in value , impairment charges may be required . allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectibility of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business . in times of domestic or global economic turmoil , our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectibility of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods . if our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low , costs and expenses may increase in future periods , and if it is too high , cost and expenses may decrease in future periods . contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and , as required , have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims . these estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results , assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies . it is possible , however , that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings . see note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information on litigation exposure . income tax audits as a matter of course , the company is regularly audited by federal , state and foreign tax authorities . Â   from time to time , these audits result in proposed assessments . Â   our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal Â   44 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â – ( continued ) Â   counsel where appropriate and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings ( or negotiations ) with taxing and legal authorities . the tax benefits ultimately realized by the company may differ from those recognized in our financial statements based on a number of factors , including the company Â ’ s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter , relevant legal precedents related to similar matters and the company Â ’ s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities . new accounting pronouncements see note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements . market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes , foreign currency fluctuations , commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments . policies and procedures in the normal course of business , we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company Â ’ s exposure to changes in interest rates , foreign currencies , commodities , and the fair market value of certain investments in debt and equity securities using a variety of financial instruments . our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs . to achieve these objectives , we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company Â ’ s portfolio of borrowings . by policy , the company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages . our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges . accordingly , the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the u . s . dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets , liabilities , commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses . the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable , but not firmly committed , transactions . the company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities . the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro , british pound , japanese yen and canadian dollar . cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to u . s . dollar denominated borrowings . by policy , the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years . the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the u . s . dollar equivalent value of the related exposures . our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes . the amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities , such as fuel , oil and gasoline . it is the company Â ’ s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above . the company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes .

tax benefit on the restructuring and impairment charges . our book value of miramax included allocated goodwill totaling $ 217 million which is not tax deductible . accordingly , the taxable gain on the sales of these businesses exceeded the $ 75 million book gain resulting in the tax expense of $ 107 million . these items collectively had no impact on eps . in the prior year quarter , the company recorded restructuring and impairment charges totaling $ 105 million and a gain on the sale of an investment in a television service in europe of $ 27 million . the charges primarily related to organizational and cost structure initiatives at our media networks and studio entertainment segments including actions taken in connection with a change in studio segment leadership . restructuring charges of $ 66 million were primarily severance and related costs while impairment charges of $ 39 million consisted of write-offs of capitalized costs related to abandoned film projects . these items collectively had a net adverse impact of $ 0 . 03 on eps . seasonality the company Â ’ s businesses are subject to the effects of seasonality . consequently , the operating results for the quarter ended january Â   1 , 2011 for each business segment , and for the company as a whole , are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year . media networks revenues are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels . in general , advertising revenues are somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months . affiliate revenues are typically collected ratably throughout the year . certain affiliate revenues at espn are deferred until annual programming commitments are met , and these commitments are typically satisfied during the second half of the company Â ’ s fiscal year which generally results in higher revenue recognition during that period . parks and resorts revenues fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities . peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods . studio entertainment revenues fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical , home entertainment , and television markets . release dates are determined by several factors , including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods . consumer products revenues are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior , which generally results in increased revenues during the company Â ’ s first fiscal quarter , and by the timing and performance of theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts . interactive media revenues fluctuate due to the timing and performance of video game releases which are determined by several factors , including theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts , competition and the timing of holiday periods . revenues from certain of our internet and mobile operations are subject to similar seasonal trends . business segment results the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment operating income , which is shown below along with segment revenues : Â   Â   Â   Â

information regarding the company Â ’ s guarantees . tax matters as disclosed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2010 annual report on form 10-k , the company has exposure for certain tax matters . contractual commitments refer to note 15 in the consolidated financial statements in the 2010 annual report on form 10-k for information regarding the company Â ’ s contractual commitments . other matters accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies , which are important to our financial position and results of operations , require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management . for a summary of our significant accounting policies , including the accounting policies discussed below , see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2010 annual report on form 10-k . film and television revenues and costs we expense film and television production , participation and residual costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period Â ’ s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues ( ultimate revenues ) for each production . if our estimate of ultimate revenues decreases , amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated . conversely , if our estimate of ultimate revenues increase , film and television cost amortization may be slowed . for film productions , ultimate revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial theatrical release . for television series , ultimate revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode , or if still in production , five years from delivery of the most recent episode , if later . with respect to films intended for theatrical release , the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues ( and therefore affecting future film cost amortization and / or impairment ) is domestic theatrical performance . revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the domestic theatrical release ( e . g . , the home entertainment or international theatrical markets ) have historically been highly correlated with domestic theatrical performance . domestic theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film , the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort . upon a film Â ’ s release and determination of domestic theatrical performance , the company Â ’ s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends . the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues for released films is the extent of home entertainment sales achieved . home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home video products as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products . with respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast , the most sensitive factor affecting estimates of ultimate revenues is the program Â ’ s rating and the strength of the advertising market . program ratings , which are an indication of market acceptance , directly affect the company Â ’ s ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program . in addition , Â   33 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â – ( continued ) Â   television series Â ’ with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the eventual sale of the program rights in the syndication , international and home entertainment markets . alternatively , poor ratings may result in a television series cancellation , which would require the immediate write-off of any unamortized production costs . a significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates . we expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired movies , series and other programs based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired or on a straight-line basis over the useful life , as appropriate . amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings . the number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the program Â ’ s ratings in previous airings , expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming . accordingly , planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary . we amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement . the estimated values of each year are based on our projection of revenues over the contract period which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue . if the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season Â ’ s relative value , we expense the related contractual payment during the applicable season . if planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly , amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed . costs of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs . the net realizable values of television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology . a daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type . the company Â ’ s dayparts are : daytime , late night , primetime , news , children , and sports ( includes network and cable ) . the net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable channel . individual programs are written-off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program . estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions . if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections , film , television and programming cost write-downs may be required . revenue recognition the company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business . see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2010 annual report on form 10-k as for a summary of these revenue recognition policies . we reduce home entertainment and software product revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and for customer programs and sales incentives . these estimates are based upon historical return experience , current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products . if we underestimate the level of returns and concessions in a particular period , we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amount . conversely , if we overestimate the level of returns and concessions for a period , we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns and concessions are less than estimated . we recognize revenues from advance theme park ticket sales when the tickets are used . for non-expiring , multi-day tickets , we recognize revenue over a three-year time period based on estimated usage , which is derived from historical usage patterns . if actual usage is different than our estimated usage , revenues may not be recognized in the periods the related services are rendered . in addition , a change in usage patterns would impact the timing of revenue recognition . Â   34 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â – ( continued ) Â   pension and postretirement medical plan actuarial assumptions the company Â ’ s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions . two critical assumptions , the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets , are important elements of expense and / or liability measurement which we evaluate annually . refer to the 2010 annual report on form 10-k for estimated impacts of changes in these assumptions . other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns , mortality , turnover and rate of compensation increase . the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date . a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense . the guideline for setting this rate is high-quality long-term corporate bond rates . the company Â ’ s discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality corporate bonds . the resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves . to determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets , we consider the current and expected asset allocation , as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class . a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense . goodwill , intangible assets , long-lived assets and investments the company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require , on an interim basis . goodwill is allocated to various reporting units , which are generally an operating segment or one level below the operating segment . the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment . if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value , an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the goodwill . to determine the fair value of our reporting units , we generally use a present value technique ( discounted cash flow ) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate . Â   we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units . the discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses . we include in the projected cash flows an estimate of the revenue we believe the reporting unit would receive if the intellectual property developed by the reporting unit that is being used by other reporting units was licensed to an unrelated third party at its fair market value . these amounts are not necessarily the same as those included in segment operating results . we believe our estimates of fair value are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units . in times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy , the company Â ’ s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual . if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions , the impairment test results could differ , and we could be required to record impairment charges . the company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts . if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value , an impairment loss is recognized . fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values , as appropriate . the company tests long-lived assets , including amortizable intangible assets , for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances ( triggering events ) indicate that the carrying amount may Â   35 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â – ( continued ) Â   not be recoverable . once a triggering event has occurred , the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale . the impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group against the carrying value of the asset group . an asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments . if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows , an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the group Â ’ s long-lived assets and the carrying value of the group Â ’ s long-lived assets . the impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts , but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value . for assets held for sale , to the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset Â ’ s fair value less costs to sell , an impairment loss is recognized for the difference . determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions , including whether a triggering event has occurred , the identification of the asset groups , estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values . if we had established different asset groups or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions , the impairment test results could differ , and we could be required to record impairment charges . the company has cost and equity investments . the fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies , as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments . in assessing potential impairment of these investments , we consider these factors , as well as the forecasted financial performance of the investees and market values , where available . if these forecasts are not met or market values indicate an other-than-temporary decline in value , impairment charges may be required . allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectibility of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business . in times of domestic or global economic turmoil , our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectibility of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods . if our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low , costs and expenses may increase in future periods , and if it is too high , cost and expenses may decrease in future periods . contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and , as required , have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims . these estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results , assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies . it is possible , however , that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings . see note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information on litigation exposure . income tax audits as a matter of course , the company is regularly audited by federal , state and foreign tax authorities . Â   from time to time , these audits result in proposed assessments . Â   our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel where appropriate and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings ( or negotiations ) with taxing and legal authorities . the tax benefits ultimately realized by the company may differ from those recognized in our financial statements based on a number of factors , including the company Â ’ s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter , relevant legal Â   36 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â – ( continued ) Â   precedents related to similar matters and the company Â ’ s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities . new accounting pronouncements see note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements . market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes , foreign currency fluctuations , commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments . policies and procedures in the normal course of business , we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company Â ’ s exposure to changes in interest rates , foreign currencies , commodities , and the fair market value of certain investments in debt and equity securities using a variety of financial instruments . our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs . to achieve these objectives , we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company Â ’ s portfolio of borrowings . by policy , the company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages . our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges . accordingly , the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the u . s . dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets , liabilities , commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses . the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable , but not firmly committed , transactions . the company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities . the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro , british pound , japanese yen and canadian dollar . cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to u . s . dollar denominated borrowings . by policy , the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years . the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the u . s . dollar equivalent value of the related exposures . our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes . the amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities , such as fuel oil and gasoline . it is the company Â ’ s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above . the company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes .

television services in europe , a gain on the sale of the rights and assets related to the power rangersseasonality the company Â ’ s businesses are subject to the effects of seasonality . consequently , the operating results for the quarter and nine months ended july Â   3 , 2010 for each business segment , and for the company as a whole , are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year . media networks revenues are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels . in general , advertising revenues are somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months . affiliate revenues are typically collected ratably throughout the year . certain affiliate revenues at espn are deferred until annual programming commitments are met , and these commitments are typically satisfied during the second half of the company Â ’ s fiscal year which generally results in higher revenue recognition during that period . parks and resorts revenues fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities . peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods . studio entertainment revenues fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical , home entertainment , and television markets . release dates are determined by several factors , including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods . consumer products revenues are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior , which generally results in increased revenues during the company Â ’ s first fiscal quarter , and by the timing and performance of theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts . interactive media revenues fluctuate due to the timing and performance of video game releases which are determined by several factors , including theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts , competition and the timing of holiday periods . revenues from certain of our internet and mobile operations are subject to similar seasonal trends .

libor-based rates plus a spread , which depends on the company Â ’ s public debt rating and can range from 0 . 18 % to 4 . 50 % . as of july Â   3 , 2010 , the company had not borrowed under these bank facilities . the company also has the ability to issue up to $ 800 million of letters of credit under the facility expiring in february 2011 , which if utilized , reduces available borrowings under this facility . as of july Â   3 , 2010 , $ 235 million of letters of credit had been issued under this facility . the company may use commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused bank facilities , in conjunction with term debt issuance and operating cash flow , to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due . on december Â   2 , 2009 , the company declared a $ 653 million dividend ( $ 0 . 35 per share ) related to fiscal 2009 for shareholders of record on december Â   14 , 2009 , which was paid on january Â   19 , 2010 . on december Â   3 , 2008 , the company declared a $ 648 million dividend ( $ 0 . 35 per share ) related to fiscal 2008 for shareholders of record on december Â   15 , 2008 , which was paid on january Â   20 , 2009 . during the nine months ended july Â   3 , 2010 , the company repurchased 45 Â   million shares of its common stock for approximately $ 1 . 5 billion . as of july Â   3 , 2010 , the company had remaining authorization in place to repurchase approximately 134 Â   million additional shares . the repurchase program does not have an expiration date . we believe that the company Â ’ s financial condition is strong and that its cash balances , other liquid assets , operating cash flows , access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity , taken together , provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects . however , the company Â ’ s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by Â   39 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â – ( continued ) Â   macroeconomic factors outside of its control . in addition to macroeconomic factors , the company Â ’ s borrowing costs can be impacted by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies , which are based , in significant part , on the company Â ’ s performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios . as of july Â   3 , 2010 , moody Â ’ s investors service Â ’ s long and short-term debt ratings for the company were a2 and p-1 , respectively , with stable outlook ; standard Â   & poor Â ’ s long and short-term debt ratings for the company were a and a-1 , respectively , with negative outlook ; and fitch Â ’ s long and short-term debt ratings for the company were a and f-1 , respectively , with stable outlook . the company Â ’ s bank facilities contain only one financial covenant , relating to interest coverage , which the company met on july Â   3 , 2010 , by a significant margin . the company Â ’ s bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities , such as euro disney and hong kong disneyland , from any representations , covenants or events of default . euro disney has annual covenants under its debt agreements that limit its investment and financing activities and require it to meet certain financial performance covenants . euro disney was in compliance with these covenants for fiscal 2009 . commitments and contingencies legal matters as disclosed in note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements , the company has exposure for certain legal matters . guarantees see note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company Â ’ s guarantees . tax matters as disclosed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2009 annual report on form 10-k as amended on form 8-k dated february Â   18 , 2010 , the company has exposure for certain tax matters . contractual commitments refer to note 15 in the consolidated financial statements in the 2009 annual report on form 10-k as amended on form 8-k dated february Â   18 , 2010 for information regarding the company Â ’ s contractual commitments . other matters accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies , which are important to our financial position and results of operations , require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management . for a summary of our significant accounting policies , including the accounting policies discussed below , see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2009 annual report on form 10-k as amended on form 8-k dated february Â   18 , 2010 . film and television revenues and costs we expense film and television production , participation and residual costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period Â ’ s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues ( ultimate revenues ) for each production . if our estimate of ultimate revenues decreases , amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated . conversely , if estimates of ultimate revenues increase , film and television cost amortization may be slowed . for film productions , ultimate revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date Â   40 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â – ( continued ) Â   of the initial theatrical release . for television series , we include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode , or if still in production , five years from delivery of the most recent episode , if later . with respect to films intended for theatrical release , the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues ( and therefore affecting future film cost amortization and / or impairment ) is domestic theatrical performance . revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the domestic theatrical release ( e . g . the home video or international theatrical markets ) have historically been highly correlated with domestic theatrical performance . domestic theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film , the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort . upon a film Â ’ s release and determination of domestic theatrical performance , the company Â ’ s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends . the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues for released films is the extent of home entertainment sales achieved . home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home video products as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products . with respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast , the most sensitive factor affecting estimates of ultimate revenues is the program Â ’ s rating and the strength of the advertising market . program ratings , which are an indication of market acceptance , directly affect the company Â ’ s ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program . in addition , television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the eventual sale of the program rights in the syndication , international and home entertainment markets . alternatively , poor ratings may result in a television series cancellation , which would require the immediate write-off of any unamortized production costs . a significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates . we expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired movies , series and other programs based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired or on a straight-line basis over the useful life , as appropriate . amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings . the number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the program Â ’ s ratings in previous airings , expected advertising rates , and availability and quality of alternative programming . accordingly , planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary . rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements are amortized during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement . the estimated values of each year are based on our projection of revenues over the contract period which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue . if the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season Â ’ s relative value , we expense the related contractual payment during the applicable season . if planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly , amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed . costs of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs . the net realizable value of the television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology . a daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type . the company Â ’ s dayparts are : early morning , daytime , late night , primetime , news , children , and sports ( includes network and cable ) . the net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable channel . individual programs are written-off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program . estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions . if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections , film , television and programming cost write-downs may be required . Â   41 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â – ( continued ) Â   revenue recognition the company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business . see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2009 annual report on form 10-k as amended on form 8-k dated february Â   18 , 2010 for a summary of these revenue recognition policies . we reduce home entertainment and software product revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and for customer programs and sales incentives . these estimates are based upon historical return experience , current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products . if we underestimate the level of returns and concessions in a particular period , we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amount . conversely , if we overestimate the level of returns and concessions for a period , we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns and concessions are less than estimated . revenues from advance theme park ticket sales are recognized when the tickets are used . for non-expiring , multi-day tickets , we recognize revenue over a three-year time period based on estimated usage , which is derived from historical usage patterns . if actual usage is different than our estimated usage , revenues may not be recognized in the periods the related services are rendered . in addition , a change in usage patterns would impact the timing of revenue recognition . pension and postretirement medical plan actuarial assumptions the company Â ’ s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions . two critical assumptions , the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets , are important elements of expense and / or liability measurement which we evaluate annually . refer to the 2009 annual report on form 10-k as amended on form 8-k dated february Â   18 , 2010 for estimated impacts of changes in these assumptions . other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns , mortality , turnover and rate of compensation increase . the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date . a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense . the guideline for setting this rate is high-quality long-term corporate bond rates that are currently available . the company Â ’ s discount rate is determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality corporate bonds . the resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves . to determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets , we consider the current and expected asset allocation , as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class . a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense . goodwill , intangible assets , long-lived assets and investments the company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if current events or circumstances require an interim impairment assessment . goodwill is allocated to various reporting units , which are generally an operating segment or one reporting level below the operating segment . the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment . if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value , an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its goodwill . Â   42 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â – ( continued ) Â   to determine the fair value of our reporting units , we generally use a present value technique ( discounted cash flow ) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate . Â   we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units . the discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses . we include in the projected cash flows an estimate of the revenue we believe the reporting unit would receive if the intellectual property developed by the reporting unit that is being used by other reporting units was licensed to an unrelated third party at its fair market value . these amounts are not necessarily the same as those included in segment operating results . we believe our estimates of fair value are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units . in times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy , the company Â ’ s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual . if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions , the impairment test results could differ , and we could be required to record impairment charges . because of the way the accounting rules work , a relatively modest reduction in our estimate of the fair value of our broadcasting reporting unit could result in a significant goodwill impairment charge . the company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts . if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value , an impairment loss is recognized . fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values , as appropriate . the company has cost and equity investments . the fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies , as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments . in assessing the potential impairment for these investments , we consider these factors , as well as the forecasted financial performance of our investees and market values , where available . if these forecasts are not met or market values indicate an other-than-temporary decline in value , impairment charges may be required . allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectibility of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business . in times of domestic or global economic turmoil , our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectibility of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods . if our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low , costs and expenses may increase in future periods , and if it is too high , cost and expenses may decrease in future periods . Â   43 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â – ( continued ) Â   contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and , as required , have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims . these estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results , assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies . it is possible , however , that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings . see note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information on litigation exposure . income tax audits as a matter of course , the company is regularly audited by federal , state and foreign tax authorities . Â   from time to time , these audits result in proposed assessments . Â   our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax liabilities and benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel where appropriate and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings ( or negotiations ) with taxing and legal authorities . the tax liabilities or benefits ultimately realized by the company may differ from those recognized in our financial statements based on a number of factors , including the company Â ’ s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter , relevant legal precedents related to similar matters and the company Â ’ s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities . stock option compensation expense compensation expense for stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial valuation model . the weighted average assumptions used in the binomial valuation model during the nine months ended july Â   3 , 2010 were 32 % for the expected volatility , 1 . 4 for the expected exercise multiple ( the multiple of exercise price to grant price at which exercises are expected to occur on average ) and 3 % for the expected termination rate . although the initial fair value of stock options is not adjusted after the grant date , changes in the company Â ’ s assumptions may change the estimated fair value of and therefore , the expense related to future stock option grants . the assumptions that cause the greatest variation in fair value in the binomial valuation model are the assumed volatility and expected exercise multiple . increases or decreases in either the assumed volatility or expected exercise multiple will cause the binomial option value to increase or decrease , respectively . the volatility assumption considers both historical and implied volatility and may be impacted by the company Â ’ s performance as well as changes in economic and market conditions . the expected exercise multiple may be influenced by the company Â ’ s future stock performance , stock price volatility and employee turnover rate . refer to the 2009 annual report on form 10-k as amended on form 8-k dated february Â   18 , 2010 for estimated impacts of changes in these assumptions . new accounting pronouncements see note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements . market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes , foreign currency fluctuations , commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments . policies and procedures in the normal course of business , we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company Â ’ s exposure to changes in interest rates , foreign currencies , commodities , and the fair market value of certain investments in debt and equity securities using a variety of financial instruments . Â   44 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â – ( continued ) Â   our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs . to achieve these objectives , we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company Â ’ s portfolio of borrowings . by policy , the company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages . our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges . accordingly , the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the u . s . dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets , liabilities , commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues . the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable , but not firmly committed , transactions . the company also uses forward contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities . the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro , british pound , japanese yen and canadian dollar . cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to u . s . dollar denominated borrowings . by policy , the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed five years . the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the u . s . dollar equivalent value of the related exposures . our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes . the amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities , such as fuel oil and gasoline . it is the company Â ’ s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above . the company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes .

Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) our process technology is , and will continue to be , a very important source of differentiation and earnings power for the company . we continue to execute on our Â “ tick-tock Â ” technology development cadence and have accelerated our 32-nanometer factory ramp . as a result of the accelerated ramp , we have raised our 2010 capital spending outlook by $ 400 Â   million , enabling us to meet the anticipated demand of our new 32 nanometer process technology products based on our new microarchitecture , code named sandy bridge , which we expect to introduce later in 2010 . from a financial condition perspective , we ended the second quarter of 2010 with an investment portfolio of $ 17 . 8 Â   billion , consisting of cash and cash equivalents , short-term investments , and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets . the cash generating power of our business was evident in the first half of 2010 with $ 7 . 6 Â   billion of cash from operations . during the first half of 2010 , we returned $ 1 . 7 Â   billion to stockholders through dividends , and in july , our board of directors declared a dividend of $ . 1575 per common share to be paid in september . strategyour goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide digital economy . as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment , we use our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits , as well as our financial resources , global presence , brand recognition , and software development . we believe that we have the scale , capacity , and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to customers Â ’ needs quickly . some of our key focus areas are listed below : Â   Â • Â   customer orientation .

Â   Â   Â • Â   business environment and software Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) we believe that the proliferation of the internet has driven the need for greater performance in pcs and servers . older pcs are increasingly incapable of handling the tasks that businesses and individual consumers demand , such as video streaming and editing , web conferencing , online gaming , social networking , and other memory-intensive applications . as these tasks become even more demanding and require more computing power , we believe that businesses and individual consumers will need and want to buy new pcs . we also believe that increased internet traffic and the increasing use of cloud computing , in which a group of linked servers provide a variety of applications and data to users over the internet , create a need for greater server infrastructure , including server products optimized for energy-efficient performance and virtualization . we believe that the trend of mobile microprocessor unit growth outpacing the growth in desktop microprocessor units will continue and that the demand for mobile microprocessors will result in the increased development of products with form factors and uses that require low-power microprocessors . we also believe that these products will result in demand that is incremental to that of microprocessors designed for notebook and desktop computers , as a growing number of households have multiple devices for different computing functions . our silicon and manufacturing technology leadership allows us to develop low-power microprocessors for these and other new uses and form factors . we believe that intel Â ® tm Â ® we are also focusing on the development of a new highly scalable , many-core architecture aimed at parallel processing , the simultaneous use of multiple cores to execute a computing task . this architecture will initially be used as a software development platform for throughput computing ( the need for large amounts of computing performance consistently over a long period of time ) . over time , this architecture may be utilized in the development of products for scientific and professional workstations as well as high-performance computing applications . in addition , we offer , and are continuing to develop , advanced nand flash memory products , focusing on system-level solutions for intel architecture platforms such as solid-state drives . in support of our strategy to provide advanced flash memory products , we continue to focus on the development of innovative products designed to address the needs of customers for reliable , non-volatile , low-cost , high-density memory . critical accounting estimatesthe methods , estimates , and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated condensed financial statements . some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments , often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain . our most critical accounting estimates include : Â   Â • Â   the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments , which impact gains ( losses ) Â   on equity method investments , net , or gains ( losses ) Â   on other equity investments , net when we record impairments ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets , which impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes ( including the measurement of uncertain tax positions ) , which impact our provision for taxes ; and Â   Â   Â • Â   the valuation of inventory , which impacts gross margin . below , we discuss these policies further , as well as the estimates and judgments involved . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) non-marketable equity investmentswe regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies , which range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models . the carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio , excluding equity derivatives , totaled $ 2 . 8 Â   billion as of june Â   26 , 2010 ( $ 3 . 4 Â   billion as of december Â   26 , 2009 ) . the majority of this balance as of june 26 , 2010 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment . our flash memory market segment investments include our investment in im flash technologies , llc ( imft ) Â   and im flash singapore , llp ( imfs ) Â   of $ 1 . 6 Â   billion ( $ 1 . 6 Â   billion as of december Â   26 , 2009 ) . for further information , see Â “ note 10 : non-marketable equity investments Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q . our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using adjusted cost basis or the equity method of accounting , depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment . our non-marketable equity investments are classified within other long-term assets on the consolidated condensed balance sheets . non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky , and their success is dependent on product development , market acceptance , operational efficiency , other key business factors , and the ability of the investee companies to raise additional funds in financial markets that can be volatile . the companies could fail , or not be able to raise additional funds when the funds are needed or they may receive lower valuations , with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings . these events could cause our investments to become impaired . in addition , financial market volatility could negatively affect our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings , mergers , and private sales . for further information about our investment portfolio risks , see Â “ risk factors Â ” in part Â   ii , item Â   1a of this form 10-q . we determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments quarterly for disclosure purposes ; however , the investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized . we determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using the market and income approaches . the market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies , such as projected revenues , earnings , and comparable performance multiples . the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors , including comparable companies Â ’ sizes , growth rates , industries , development stages , and other relevant factors . the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model , which may include one or multiple discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates for the investee : revenue , based on assumed market segment size and assumed market segment share ; expenses , capital spending , and other costs ; and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies . estimates of market segment size , market segment share , expenses , capital spending , and other costs are developed by the investee and / or intel using historical data and available market data . the valuation of our non-marketable investments also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets , recent financing activities by the investees , the investees Â ’ capital structure , and differences in seniority and rights associated with the investees Â ’ capital structure . for non-marketable equity investments , the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment , such as : Â   Â • Â   the investee Â ’ s revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business prospects ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the technological feasibility of the investee Â ’ s products and technologies ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the general market conditions in the investee Â ’ s industry or geographic area , including adverse regulatory or economic changes ; Â   Â   Â • Â   factors related to the investee Â ’ s ability to remain in business , such as the investee Â ’ s liquidity , debt ratios , and the rate at which the investee is using its cash ; and Â   Â   Â • Â   the investee Â ’ s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation . if the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value , we determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis , which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal . if the investment is considered to be other than temporarily impaired , we write down the investment to its fair value . impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $ 17 Â   million in the second quarter of 2010 ( $ 63 Â   million in the first half of 2010 ) . over the past 12 quarters , including the second quarter of 2010 , impairments of non-marketable equity investments ranged from $ 11 Â   million to $ 896 Â   million per quarter . this range included impairments of $ 896 Â   million during the fourth quarter of 2008 , primarily related to a $ 762 Â   million impairment charge on our investment in clearwire communications , llc ( clearwire llc ) . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) imft / imfsimft and imfs are variable interest entities that are designed to manufacture and sell nand products to intel and micron technology , inc . at manufacturing cost . we determine the fair value of our investment in imft / imfs using the income approach based on a weighted average of multiple discounted cash flow scenarios of our nand solutions group business , which requires the use of unobservable inputs . unobservable inputs that require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments are the estimates for projected revenue and discount rate . changes in management estimates for these unobservable inputs have the most significant effect on the fair value determination . we have not had an other-than-temporary impairment on our investment in imft / imfs . it is reasonably possible that the estimates used in the fair value determination could change in the near term , which could result in an impairment of our investment . long-lived assetswe assess the impairment of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable . factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations , significant negative industry or economic trends , and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets . we measure the recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows . if an asset grouping Â ’ s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows , the asset grouping is considered to be impaired . the impairment is measured by comparing the difference between the asset grouping Â ’ s carrying value and its fair value . fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date . long-lived assets such as goodwill ; intangible assets ; and property , plant and equipment are considered non-financial assets , and are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized . impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows . due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity , we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings . in addition , as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions , we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets , primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements . when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated , we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets Â ’ new , shorter useful lives . over the past 12 quarters , including the second quarter of 2010 , impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets ranged from $ 10 Â   million to $ 300 million per quarter . income taxeswe must make estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes . these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits , benefits , and deductions , and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes , as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions . significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period . we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets . if recovery is not likely , we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable . we believe that we will ultimately recover a majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated condensed balance sheets . however , should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets , our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely . recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by management Â ’ s plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments ; therefore , changes in management Â ’ s plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations . we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process . the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit , including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes , if any . if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit , the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 % likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement . it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts , as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes . we re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis . this evaluation is based on factors such as changes in facts or circumstances , changes in tax law , new audit activity , and effectively settled issues . determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment . such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision . inventorythe valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality . the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products . the estimate of future demand is compared to work-in-process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount , if any , of obsolete or excess inventory . as of june Â   26 , 2010 , our work-in-process inventory totaled $ 1 . 6 billion and finished goods inventory totaled $ 1 . 3 Â   billion . the demand forecast is included in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions . product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base , the stage of the product life cycle of our products , consumer confidence , and customer acceptance of our products , as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost . if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly , we could be required to write off inventory , which would negatively impact our gross margin . in order to determine what costs can be included in the valuation of inventory , we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities , based on historical loadings of wafers compared to total available capacity . if the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level , a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory , and therefore would be recognized as cost of sales in that period , which would negatively impact our gross margin . we refer to these costs as excess capacity charges . over the past 12 quarters , excess capacity charges ranged from zero to $ 680 Â   million per quarter . accounting changes and recent accounting standardsfor a description of accounting changes and recent accounting standards , including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects , if any , on our consolidated condensed financial statements , see Â “ note 2 : accounting changes Â ” and Â “ note 3 : recent accounting standards Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q .

Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) investing activitiesthe increase in cash used for investing activities in the first half of 2010 , compared to the first half of 2009 , was due to an increase in net purchases of trading assets and available-for-sale investments . these increases were partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures due to the timing of the ramp of our latest silicon process technology . financing activitiesthe decrease in cash used for financing activities in the first half of 2010 , compared to the first half of 2009 , was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans , an increase in short-term debt ( drafts payable ) in the first half of 2010 compared to a decrease in short-term debt ( drafts payable ) in the first half of 2009 , and proceeds from government grants . these increases were partially offset by higher dividend payments and an increase in repurchases and retirement of common stock . liquiditycash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity . as of june Â   26 , 2010 , cash and cash equivalents , marketable debt instruments included in trading assets , and short-term investments totaled $ 17 . 8 Â   billion . in addition to the $ 17 . 8 Â   billion , we have $ 4 . 7 Â   billion in loans receivable and other long-term investments that we include when assessing our investment portfolio . the credit quality of our investment portfolio remains high , and we continue to be able to invest in high-credit-quality investments . substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with a / a2 or better rated issuers , and a substantial majority of the issuers are rated aa- / aa3 or better . our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity . we have an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $ 3 . 0 Â   billion , including through the issuance of commercial paper . maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during the first half of 2010 were $ 150 Â   million , although no commercial paper remained outstanding as of june 26 , 2010 . our commercial paper was rated a-1 + by standard & poor Â ’ s and p-1 by moody Â ’ s as of june 26 , 2010 . we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt , equity , and other securities . we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 Â   months , including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test , working capital requirements , and potential dividends , common stock repurchases , and acquisitions or strategic investments . fair value of financial instrumentsfair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date . when determining fair value , we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact , and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability . see Â “ note 4 : fair value Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q . credit risk is factored into the valuation of financial instruments that we measure and record at fair value on a recurring basis . when fair value is determined using pricing models , such as a discounted cash flow model , the issuer Â ’ s credit risk and / or intel Â ’ s credit risk is factored into the calculation of the fair value , as appropriate . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) marketable debt instrumentsas of june Â   26 , 2010 , our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 21 . 5 Â   billion of marketable debt instruments . of these instruments , $ 2 . 0 Â   billion was classified as level 1 , $ 18 . 9 Â   billion as level 2 , and $ 573 Â   million as level 3 . our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 was classified as such due to the usage of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets . management judgment was required to determine the levels for the frequency of transactions that should be met for a market to be considered active . our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into consideration activity of each individual instrument , including the number of days each individual instrument trades . of the $ 18 . 9 Â   billion balance of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2 , approximately 55 % of the balance was classified as level 2 due to the usage of a discounted cash flow model and approximately 45 % due to the usage of non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data . our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes . when observable market data is not available , we corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes using unobservable data , if available . all of our investments in asset-backed securities were classified as level 3 , and substantially all of them were valued using non-binding market consensus prices that we were not able to corroborate with observable market data due to the lack of transparency in the market for asset-backed securities . equity securitiesas of june Â   26 , 2010 , our portfolio of assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 1 . 6 Â   billion of marketable equity securities ( including marketable equity securities receivable ) . of these securities , $ 783 Â   million was classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets . our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one-month period prior to the valuation date for individual securities , including the number of days individual equity securities trade and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding shares of that security . the remaining marketable equity securities of $ 767 Â   million were classified as level 2 because their valuations were either based on quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets or adjusted for security-specific restrictions .

Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) our overall gross margin percentage was better than expected , declining slightly from the record gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter . this slight decline was a result of higher platform ( microprocessor and chipset ) unit costs due to a higher proportion of early ramp 32nm process technology products and , to a lesser extent , lower microprocessor sales volume . more recently introduced products tend to have higher average costs which decline as production ramps . this was partially offset by slightly higher average selling prices due to the higher proportion of premium mobile products . we expect our gross margin percentage to increase in the second quarter as unit costs decline on the continued ramp of 32nm process technology . our product lineup is well positioned across the computing spectrum . the ramp of the 32nm process technology is the fastest in our history . in march Â   2010 , we introduced the intel Â ® Â ® from a financial condition perspective , we ended the first quarter of 2010 with an investment portfolio of $ 16 . 3 Â   billion , consisting of cash and cash equivalents , trading assets , and short-term investments . the cash generating power of our business was evident in the first quarter of 2010 with $ 4 . 1 Â   billion of cash from operations . during the first quarter of 2010 , we returned $ 870 million to stockholders through dividends , and in march , our board of directors declared a dividend of $ . 1575 per common share to be paid in june . strategyour goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide digital economy . as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment , we use our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits , as well as our financial resources , global presence , brand recognition , and software development . we believe that we have the scale , capacity , and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to customers Â ’ needs quickly . some of our key focus areas are listed below : Â   Â • Â   customer orientation . Â   Â • Â   architecture and platforms . Â   Â • Â   silicon and manufacturing technology leadership . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   Â • Â   strategic investments . Â   Â • Â   business environment and softwarewe believe that the proliferation of the internet has driven the need for greater performance in pcs and servers . older pcs are increasingly incapable of handling the tasks that businesses and individual consumers demand , such as video streaming and editing , web conferencing , online gaming , social networking , and other memory-intensive applications . as these tasks become even more demanding and require more computing power , we believe that businesses and individual consumers will need and want to buy new pcs . we also believe that increased internet traffic and the increasing use of cloud computing , in which a group of linked servers provide a variety of applications and data to users over the internet , create a need for greater server infrastructure , including server products optimized for energy-efficient performance and virtualization . we believe that the trend of mobile microprocessor unit growth outpacing the growth in desktop microprocessor units will continue and that the demand for mobile microprocessors will result in the increased development of products with form factors and uses that require low-power microprocessors . we also believe that these products will result in demand that is incremental to that of microprocessors designed for notebook and desktop computers , as a growing number of households have multiple devices for different computing functions . our silicon and manufacturing technology leadership allows us to develop low-power microprocessors for these and other new uses and form factors . we believe that intel atom processors give us the ability to extend intel Â ® we are also focusing on the development of a new highly scalable , many-core architecture aimed at parallel processing , the simultaneous use of multiple cores to execute a computing task . this architecture will initially be used as a software development platform for graphics and throughput computing ( the need for large amounts of computing performance consistently over a long period of time ) . over time , this architecture may be utilized in the development of products for scientific and professional workstations as well as high-performance computing applications . in addition , we offer , and are continuing to develop , advanced nand flash memory products , focusing on system-level solutions for intel architecture platforms such as solid-state drives . in support of our strategy to provide advanced flash memory products , we continue to focus on the development of innovative products designed to address the needs of customers for reliable , non-volatile , low-cost , high-density memory . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) critical accounting estimatesthe methods , estimates , and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated condensed financial statements . some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments , often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain . our most critical accounting estimates include : Â   Â • Â   the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments , which impact gains ( losses ) Â   on equity method investments , net , or gains ( losses ) Â   on other equity investments , net when we record impairments ; Â   Â • Â   the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets , which primarily impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation ; Â   Â • Â   the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes ( including the measurement of uncertain tax positions ) , which impact our provision for taxes ; and Â   Â • Â   the valuation of inventory , which impacts gross margin . below , we discuss these policies further , as well as the estimates and judgments involved . non-marketable equity investmentswe regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies , which range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models . the carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio , excluding equity derivatives , totaled $ 3 . 3 Â   billion as of march Â   27 , 2010 ( $ 3 . 4 Â   billion as of december Â   26 , 2009 ) . the majority of this balance as of march 27 , 2010 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment . our flash memory market segment investments include our investment in im flash technologies , llc ( imft ) Â   and im flash singapore , llp ( imfs ) Â   of $ 1 . 6 Â   billion ( $ 1 . 6 Â   billion as of december Â   26 , 2009 ) . for further information , see Â “ note 10 : non-marketable equity investments Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q . our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using adjusted cost basis or the equity method of accounting , depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment . our non-marketable equity investments are classified within other long-term assets on the consolidated condensed balance sheets . non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky , and a number of the companies in which we invest could fail . their success is dependent on product development , market acceptance , operational efficiency , and other key business factors . depending on their future prospects , the companies may not be able to raise additional funds when the funds are needed or they may receive lower valuations , with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings , and our investments would likely become impaired . additionally , financial markets and credit markets are volatile , which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in , their ability to raise additional capital , and the likelihood of our being able to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings , mergers , and private sales . for further information about our investment portfolio risks , see Â “ risk factors Â ” in part Â   ii , item 1a of this form 10-q . we determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments quarterly for disclosure purposes ; however , the investments are recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized . we determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using the market and income approaches . the market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies , such as projected revenues , earnings , and comparable performance multiples . the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors , including comparable companies Â ’ sizes , growth rates , industries , development stages , and other relevant factors . in addition , the market approach includes the use of quoted prices in active markets . the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model , which may include one or multiple discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates for the investee : revenue , based on assumed market segment size and assumed market segment share ; expenses , capital spending , and other costs ; and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies . estimates of market segment size , market segment share , expenses , capital spending , and other costs are developed by the investee and / or intel using historical data and available market data . the valuation of our non-marketable investments also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets , recent financing activities by the investees , the investees Â ’ capital structure , and differences in seniority and rights associated with the investees Â ’ capital . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) for non-marketable equity investments , the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment , such as : Â   Â • Â   the investee Â ’ s revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business prospects ; Â   Â • Â   the technological feasibility of the investee Â ’ s products and technologies ; Â   Â • Â   the general market conditions in the investee Â ’ s industry or geographic area , including adverse regulatory or economic changes ; Â   Â • Â   factors related to the investee Â ’ s ability to remain in business , such as the investee Â ’ s liquidity , debt ratios , and the rate at which the investee is using its cash ; and Â   Â • Â   the investee Â ’ s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation . if the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value , we determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis , which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal . if the investment is considered to be other than temporarily impaired , we write down the investment to its fair value . impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $ 46 Â   million in the first quarter of 2010 . over the past 12 quarters , including the first quarter of 2010 , impairments of non-marketable equity investments ranged from $ 11 Â   million to $ 896 Â   million per quarter . this range included impairments of $ 896 Â   million during the fourth quarter of 2008 , primarily related to a $ 762 Â   million impairment charge on our investment in clearwire communications , llc ( clearwire llc ) . imft / imfsimft and imfs are variable interest entities that are designed to manufacture and sell nand products to intel and micron technology , inc . at manufacturing cost . we determine the fair value of our investment in imft / imfs using the income approach based on a weighted average of multiple discounted cash flow scenarios of our nand solutions group business , which requires the use of unobservable inputs . unobservable inputs that require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments are the estimates for projected revenue and discount rate . changes in management estimates for these unobservable inputs have the most significant effect on the fair value determination . we did not have an other-than-temporary impairment on our investment in imft / imfs in the first quarters of 2010 and 2009 . it is reasonably possible that the estimates used in the fair value determination could change in the near term , which could result in an impairment of our investment . long-lived assetswe assess the impairment of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable . factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations , significant negative industry or economic trends , and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets . we measure the recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows . if an asset grouping Â ’ s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows , the asset grouping is considered to be impaired . the impairment is measured by comparing the difference between the asset grouping Â ’ s carrying value and its fair value . fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date . long-lived assets such as goodwill ; intangible assets ; and property , plant and equipment are considered non-financial assets , and are recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized . impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows . due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity , we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings . in addition , as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions , we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets , primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements . when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated , we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets Â ’ new , shorter useful lives . over the past 12 quarters , including the first quarter of 2010 , impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets ranged from $ 40 Â   million to $ 300 million per quarter . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) income taxeswe must make estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes . these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits , benefits , and deductions , and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes , as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions . significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period . we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets . if recovery is not likely , we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable . we believe that we will ultimately recover a majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated condensed balance sheets . however , should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets , our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely . recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by management Â ’ s plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments ; therefore , changes in management Â ’ s plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes . the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations . we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process . the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit , including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes , if any . if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit , the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 % likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement . it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts , as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes . we re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis . this evaluation is based on factors such as changes in facts or circumstances , changes in tax law , new audit activity , and effectively settled issues . determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment . such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision . inventorythe valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality . the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products . the estimate of future demand is compared to work-in-process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount , if any , of obsolete or excess inventory . as of march Â   27 , 2010 , we had total work-in-process inventory of $ 1 , 473 Â   million and total finished goods inventory of $ 1 , 049 Â   million . the demand forecast is included in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions . product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base , the stage of the product life cycle of our products , consumer confidence , and customer acceptance of our products , as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost . if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly , we could be required to write off inventory , which would negatively impact our gross margin . in order to determine what costs can be included in the valuation of inventory , we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities , based on historical loadings of wafers compared to total available capacity . if the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level , a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory , and therefore would be recognized as cost of sales in that period , which would negatively impact our gross margin . we refer to these costs as excess capacity charges . over the past 12 quarters , excess capacity charges ranged from zero to $ 680 Â   million per quarter . accounting changes and recent accounting standardsfor a description of accounting changes and recent accounting standards , including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects , if any , on our consolidated condensed financial statements , see Â “ note 2 : accounting changes Â ” and Â “ note 3 : recent accounting standards Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q .

Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) liquiditycash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity . as of march Â   27 , 2010 , cash and cash equivalents , trading assets , and short-term investments totaled $ 16 . 3 Â   billion . in addition to the $ 16 . 3 Â   billion , we have $ 4 . 9 Â   billion in loans receivable and other long-term investments that we include when assessing our investment portfolio . the credit quality of our investment portfolio remains high , and we continue to be able to invest in high-credit-quality investments . substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with a / a2 or better rated issuers , and a substantial majority of the issuers are rated aa- / aa3 or better . our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity . we have an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $ 3 . 0 Â   billion , including through the issuance of commercial paper . maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during the first quarter of 2010 were $ 50 Â   million , although no commercial paper remained outstanding as of march Â   27 , 2010 . our commercial paper was rated a-1 + by standard & poor Â ’ s and p-1 by moody Â ’ s as of march Â   27 , 2010 . we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt , equity , and other securities . we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 Â   months , including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test , working capital requirements , and potential dividends , common stock repurchases , and acquisitions or strategic investments . fair value of financial instrumentsfair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date . when determining fair value , we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact , and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability . see Â “ note 4 : fair value Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q . credit risk is factored into the valuation of financial instruments that we measure and record at fair value on a recurring basis . when fair value is determined using pricing models , such as a discounted cash flow model , the issuer Â ’ s credit risk and / or intel Â ’ s credit risk is factored into the calculation of the fair value , as appropriate . marketable debt instrumentsas of march Â   27 , 2010 , our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 20 . 5 Â   billion of marketable debt instruments . of these instruments , $ 609 Â   million was classified as level 1 , $ 19 . 1 Â   billion as level 2 , and $ 745 Â   million as level 3 . our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 was classified as such due to the usage of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets . management judgment was required to determine the levels at which sufficient volume and frequency of transactions are met for a market to be considered active . our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into consideration four weeks of activity prior to the valuation date of each individual instrument , including the number of days each individual instrument trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding amount of the issued instrument . of the $ 19 . 1 Â   billion balance of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2 , approximately 55 % of the balance was classified as level 2 due to the usage of a discounted cash flow model , approximately 35 % due to the usage of non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data , and approximately 10 % due to the usage of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in less active markets . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes . when observable market data is not available , we corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes using unobservable data , if available . all of our investments in asset-backed securities were classified as level 3 , and substantially all of them were valued using non-binding market consensus prices that we were not able to corroborate with observable market data due to the lack of transparency in the market for asset-backed securities . equity securitiesas of march Â   27 , 2010 , our portfolio of assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 926 Â   million of marketable equity securities . of these securities , $ 602 Â   million was classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets . our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one-month period prior to the valuation date for individual securities , including the number of days individual equity securities trade and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding shares of that security . the remaining marketable equity securities of $ 324 Â   million were classified as level 2 because their valuations were either based on quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets or adjusted for security-specific restrictions .

Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) our strong third quarter financial results emphasizes that we have the right product offerings in the marketplace at the right cost . in the third quarter we began volume production using our new 32nm processor technology that features our 2ndfrom a financial condition perspective , we ended the third quarter of 2009 with a high credit quality investment portfolio of $ 12 . 9 Â   billion , consisting of cash and cash equivalents , debt instruments included in trading assets , and short term investments . during the third quarter of 2009 we generated $ 4 . 0 Â   billion in cash from operations despite paying the Â € finally , in september we announced a broad reorganization to better align our business around the core competencies of intel architecture and our manufacturing operations . we are currently in the process of making these changes to our organization and our systems . strategyour goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide digital and internet connected economy . as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment , we use our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits , as well as our financial resources , global presence , and brand recognition . we believe that we have the scale , capacity , and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to customers Â ’ needs quickly . some of our key focus areas are listed below : Â   Â • Â   customer orientation . Â   Â • Â   architecture and platforms . Â   Â • Â   silicon and manufacturing technology leadership . Â   Â • Â   strategic investments . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   Â • Â   business environment and softwarewe believe that the proliferation of the internet , including user demand for premium content and rich media , drives the need for greater performance in pcs and servers . older pcs are increasingly incapable of handling the tasks that users demand , such as streaming video , uploading photos , and online gaming . as these tasks become even more demanding and require more computing power , we believe that users will need and want to buy new pcs to perform everyday tasks on the internet . we also believe that increased internet traffic and the increasing use of cloud computing , where a group of linked servers provide a variety of applications and data to users over the internet , create a need for greater server infrastructure , including server products optimized for energy-efficient performance and virtualization . in september Â   2009 , we announced a broad reorganization to better align our business around the core competencies of intel architecture and our manufacturing operations . we are currently in the process of making these changes to our organization and our systems . given the scope and size of the business lines being impacted , this reorganization is expected to be in effect and reported in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december Â   26 , 2009 . under the new operating structure , our reportable operating segments will include the pc client group and data center group . the pc client group will include our mobile and desktop products and the data center group will include our server and workstation products . we believe the trend of mobile microprocessor unit growth outpacing the growth in desktop microprocessor units will continue . we believe that the demand for mobile microprocessors will result in the increased development of products with form factors and uses that require low-power microprocessors . we also believe that these products will result in demand that is incremental to that of microprocessors designed for notebook and desktop computers , as a growing number of households have multiple devices for different computing functions . our silicon and manufacturing technology leadership allows us to develop low-power microprocessors for these and other new uses and form factors . we believe that intel atom processors give us the ability to extend intel architecture and drive growth in new market segments , including a growing number of products that require processors specifically designed for embedded devices , handhelds , consumer electronics devices , nettops , and netbooks . we also believe that our intel atom developer program , which we expect to spur new applications that run on products using intel atom processors , will expedite our growth strategy in these new market segments . we believe that the common elements for products in these new market segments are low power consumption and the ability to access the internet . to meet the demands of new and evolving mobile , consumer electronics , and various embedded market segments , we also offer , and are continuing to develop , system on chip ( soc ) products that integrate the core processing functionality of our intel atom processors with specific components , such as graphics , audio , and video , onto a single chip . this integration reduces cost , power consumption , and size . we are collaborating with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company , ltd . ( tsmc ) , a large semiconductor foundry , in an effort to broaden the market opportunities for intel atom processors in soc products by integrating our intel atom processor cores with tsmc Â ’ s process technology platform . we are also focusing on the development of a new highly scalable , many-core architecture aimed at parallel processing , the simultaneous use of multiple cores to execute a computing task . this architecture will initially be used in developing discrete graphics processors designed for gaming and media creation . over time , this architecture may be utilized in the development of products for scientific and professional workstations as well as high-performance computing applications . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) critical accounting estimatesthe methods , estimates , and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our financial statements . some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments , often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain . our most critical accounting estimates include : Â   Â • Â   the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments , which impact gains ( losses ) Â   on equity method investments , net , or gains ( losses ) Â   on other equity investments , net when we record impairments ; Â   Â • Â   the valuation of investments in debt instruments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments , which impact our investment portfolio balance when we assess fair value , and interest and other , net when we record other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale debt instruments within earnings ; Â   Â • Â   the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets , which primarily impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation ; Â   Â • Â   the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes ( including the measurement of uncertain tax positions ) , which impact our provision for taxes ; and Â   Â • Â   the valuation of inventory , which impacts gross margin . below , we discuss these policies further , as well as the estimates and judgments involved . we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies , such as those for revenue recognition , including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors ; however , these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective . non-marketable equity investmentsthe carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio , excluding equity derivatives , totaled $ 3 . 5 Â   billion as of september Â   26 , 2009 ( $ 4 . 1 Â   billion as of december Â   27 , 2008 ) . the majority of this balance as of september Â   26 , 2009 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment . our flash memory market segment investments include our investment in im flash technologies , llc ( imft ) Â   of $ 1 . 4 Â   billion ( $ 1 . 7 Â   billion as of december Â   27 , 2008 ) , our investment in im flash singapore , llp ( imfs ) Â   of $ 305 Â   million ( $ 329 Â   million as of december Â   27 , 2008 ) , and our investment in numonyx b . v . of $ 438 Â   million ( $ 484 Â   million as of december Â   27 , 2008 ) . in addition , we regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies , which range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models . for additional information , see Â “ note 10 : equity method investments Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q . our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using adjusted cost basis or the equity method of accounting , depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment . our non-marketable equity investments are classified in other long-term assets on the consolidated condensed balance sheets . non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky , and a number of the companies in which we invest are likely to fail . their success is dependent on product development , market acceptance , operational efficiency , and other key business factors . depending on their future prospects , the companies may not be able to raise additional funds when the funds are needed or they may receive lower valuations , with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings , and our investments would likely become impaired . additionally , financial markets and credit markets are volatile , which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in , their ability to raise additional capital , and the likelihood of our being able to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings , mergers , and private sales . for further information about our investment portfolio risks , see Â “ risk factors Â ” in part Â   ii , item Â   1a of this form 10-q . we measure the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments quarterly for disclosure purposes ; however , the investments are only recorded at fair value when an impairment charge is recognized . for non-marketable equity investments , the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of events or circumstances identified that impact the fair value of the investment , including : Â   Â • Â   the investee Â ’ s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects ; Â   Â • Â   the technological feasibility of the investee Â ’ s products and technologies ; Â   Â • Â   the general market conditions in the investee Â ’ s industry or geographic area , including adverse regulatory or economic changes ; Â   Â • Â   factors related to the investee Â ’ s ability to remain in business , such as the investee Â ’ s liquidity , debt ratios , and the rate at which the investee is using its cash ; and Â   Â • Â   the investee Â ’ s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) if the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value , we determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired based on our qualitative and quantitative analysis , which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment . if the investment is considered to be other than temporarily impaired , we write down the investment to its fair value . with the exception of clearwire communications , llc ( clearwire llc ) , the fair value of our non-marketable investments are classified as level 3 when impaired , as we use unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the fair value measurement , and the valuation requires management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices and inherent lack of liquidity . if impaired , the fair value of our investment in clearwire llc would be classified as level 2 , as the unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology would not be significant to the fair value measurement . impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $ 50 Â   million in the third quarter of 2009 ( $ 168 Â   million in the first nine months of 2009 ) . over the past 12 quarters , including the third quarter of 2009 , impairments of non-marketable equity investments have ranged from $ 11 Â   million to $ 896 Â   million per quarter . this range includes impairments of $ 896 Â   million during the fourth quarter of 2008 , which were primarily related to a $ 762 Â   million impairment charge on our investment in clearwire llc . the following is a discussion of the methods , estimates , and judgments that management uses in our analysis to determine if our non-marketable equity investments are other than temporarily impaired . imft / imfsimft and imfs are variable interest entities that are designed to manufacture and sell nand products to intel and micron technology , inc . at manufacturing cost . our nand solutions group operating segment purchases 49 % of these nand products from imft and sells them to our customers . as a result , we generate cash flows from these investments and our intangible assets related to the nand product designs through our nand solutions group business . therefore , we determine the fair value of our investments in imft and imfs using the income approach , based on a weighted average of multiple discounted cash flow scenarios of our nand solutions group business . the discounted cash flow scenarios require the use of unobservable inputs , including assumptions of projected revenues ( based on expectations for product volume , product mix , and average selling prices ) , expenses , capital spending , and other costs , as well as a discount rate . estimates of projected revenues , expenses , capital spending , and other costs are developed by imft , imfs , and intel using historical data and available market data . management also determines how multiple discounted cash flow scenarios are weighted in the fair value determination . additionally , the development of several inputs used in our income model ( such as discount rate ) requires the selection of comparable companies within the nand flash memory market segment . the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors , including nand products and services lines within the flash memory market segment , comparable companies Â ’ sizes , growth rates , and other relevant factors . changes in management estimates to the unobservable inputs would change the fair value of the investments . the estimates for projected revenue and discount rate are the assumptions that most significantly affect the fair value determination . we did not have an other-than-temporary impairment on our investments in imft and imfs in the first nine months of 2009 or the first nine months of 2008 . it is reasonably possible that the estimates used in the fair value determination could change in the near term and result in an impairment of our investments . numonyxwe determine the fair value of our investment in numonyx using a combination of the income approach and the market approach . the income approach includes the use of a weighted average of multiple discounted cash flow scenarios of numonyx , which requires the use of unobservable inputs , including assumptions of projected revenues , expenses , capital spending , and other costs , as well as a discount rate calculated based on the risk profile of the flash memory market segment comparable to our investment in numonyx . estimates of projected revenues , expenses , capital spending , and other costs are developed by numonyx and intel . the market approach includes using financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies , such as projected revenues , earnings , and comparable performance multiples . the selection of comparable companies used in the market approach requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors , including nor products and services lines within the flash memory market segment , comparable companies Â ’ sizes , growth rates , and other relevant factors . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) changes in management estimates to the unobservable inputs in our valuation models would change the fair value of the investment . the estimated projected revenue is the assumption that most significantly affects the fair value determination . management judgment is also involved in determining how the income approach and the market approach are weighted in the fair value determination . we did not have an other-than-temporary impairment on our investment in numonyx in the first nine months of 2009 . we recorded a $ 250 Â   million impairment charge on our investment in numonyx during the third quarter of 2008 to write down our investment to its fair value . estimates for revenue , earnings , and future cash flows were revised lower due to a general decline in the nor flash memory market segment . it is reasonably possible that the estimates used in the fair value determination could change in the near term and result in an additional impairment of our investment . other non-marketable equity investmentswe determine the fair value of these non-marketable equity investments using the market approach and / or the income approach . the market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies . the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors , including comparable companies Â ’ sizes , growth rates , industries , development stages , and other relevant factors . the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model , which requires the following significant estimates for the investee : revenue , based on assumed market segment size and assumed market segment share ; estimated costs ; and appropriate discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies . estimates of market segment size , market segment share , and costs are developed by the investee and / or intel using historical data and available market data . the valuation of our other non-marketable investments also takes into account movements of the public equity and venture capital markets , recent financing activities by the investees , changes in the interest rate environment , the investee Â ’ s capital structure , differences in seniority and preferences for instruments issued by investees , and other economic variables . investments in debt instrumentsfair valuethe assessment of the fair value of debt instruments can be difficult and subjective . changes occurring in financial markets can lead to changes in the fair value of financial instruments in relatively short periods of time . there are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value ( see Â “ note 4 : fair value Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q ) . each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value . level 1 instruments represent quoted prices in active markets . therefore , determining fair value for level 1 instruments does not require significant management judgment , and the estimation is not difficult . level 2 instruments include observable inputs other than level 1 prices , such as quoted prices for identical instruments in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions ( less active markets ) , issuer credit ratings , non-binding market consensus prices that can be corroborated with observable market data , model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities , or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities . these level 2 instruments require more management judgment and subjectivity compared to level 1 instruments , including : Â   Â • Â   determining which instruments are most similar to the instrument being priced requires management to identify a sample of similar securities based on the coupon rates , maturity , issuer , credit rating , and instrument type , and subjectively select an individual security or multiple securities that are deemed most similar to the security being priced . Â   Â   Â • Â   determining whether a market is considered active requires management judgment . our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one-month period prior to the valuation date of each individual instrument , including the number of days each individual instrument trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding amount of the issued instrument . Â   Â   Â • Â   determining which model-derived valuations to use in determining fair value requires management judgment . when observable market prices for identical securities or similar securities are not available , we price our marketable debt instruments using non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data or pricing models , such as discounted cash flow models , with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) level 3 instruments include unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities . the determination of fair value for level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity . most of our marketable debt instruments classified as level 3 are valued using a non-binding market consensus price or a non-binding broker quote , both of which we corroborate with unobservable data . non-binding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers . these valuation models incorporate a number of inputs , including non-binding and binding broker quotes ; observable market prices for identical and / or similar securities ; and the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs , and to a lesser degree non-observable market inputs . adjustments to the fair value of instruments priced using non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes , and classified as level 3 , were not significant in the third quarter of 2009 . other-than-temporary impairmentafter determining the fair value of our available-for-sale debt instruments , gains or losses on these investments are recorded to other comprehensive income ( loss ) , until either the investment is sold or we determine that the decline in value is other-than-temporary . determining whether the decline in fair value is other-than-temporary requires management judgment based on the specific facts and circumstances of each investment . for investments in debt instruments , these judgments primarily consider the financial condition and liquidity of the issuer , the issuer Â ’ s credit rating , and any specific events that may cause us to believe that the debt instrument will not mature and be paid in full ; if we have the intent to sell the investment ; and if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell an investment that has unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income before we recover the amortized cost basis . given changing market conditions , we may recognize other-than-temporary impairments on these investments in the future . for available-for-sale debt instruments that are considered other-than-temporarily impaired and that we do not intend to sell and will not be required to sell prior to recovery of our amortized cost basis , we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors . the credit loss component is recognized in earnings and is the difference between the debt instrument Â ’ s amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows . the remaining difference between the debt instrument Â ’ s fair value and the present value of future expected cash flows is due to factors that are not credit related and is recognized in other comprehensive income . as of september Â   26 , 2009 , our investments included $ 12 . 2 Â   billion of available-for-sale debt instruments . we have recognized less than $ 55 Â   million of credit-related other-than-temporary impairment losses in earnings on our available-for-sale debt instruments cumulatively since the beginning of 2008 . as of september Â   26 , 2009 , our cumulative unrealized losses related to debt instruments classified as available-for-sale were approximately $ 90 Â   million ( approximately $ 215 million as of december Â   27 , 2008 ) . as of september Â   26 , 2009 , this amount included approximately $ 35 million of unrecognized losses that could be recognized in the future . long-lived assetswe assess the impairment of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable . factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations , significant negative industry or economic trends , and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets . we measure the recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows . if an asset grouping Â ’ s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows , the asset grouping is considered to be impaired . the impairment is measured by comparing the difference between the asset grouping Â ’ s carrying value and its fair value . fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date . long-lived assets such as goodwill ; intangible assets ; and property , plant and equipment are considered non-financial assets , and are recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized . impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows . due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity , we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings . in addition , as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions , we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets , primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements . when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated , we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets Â ’ new , shorter useful lives . over the past 12 quarters , including the third quarter of 2009 , impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets ranged from $ 40 Â   million to $ 320 million per quarter . for further discussion on asset impairment charges , see Â “ note 17 : restructuring and asset impairment charges Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) income taxeswe must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes . these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits , benefits , and deductions , and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities , which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes , as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions . significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period . we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets . if recovery is not likely , we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable . we believe that we will ultimately recover a majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated condensed balance sheets . however , should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets , our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely . changes in management Â ’ s plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes . the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations . we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process . the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit , including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes , if any . if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit , the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 % likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement . it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts , as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes . we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis . this evaluation is based on factors including , but not limited to , changes in facts or circumstances , changes in tax law , effectively settled issues under audit , and new audit activity . our gross unrecognized tax benefits were $ 377 million as of september Â   26 , 2009 . it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 Â   months . such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision . given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined , we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits . however , we can reasonably expect a minimum reduction of approximately $ 200 Â   million of our existing gross unrealized tax benefits upon settlement or effective settlement with the various tax authorities , the closure of certain audits , and the lapse of statute of limitations within the next 12 Â   months . inventorythe valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality . the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products . the estimate of future demand is compared to work in process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount , if any , of obsolete or excess inventory . as of september Â   26 , 2009 , we had total work-in-process inventory of $ 1 , 072 Â   million and total finished goods inventory of $ 1 , 020 Â   million . the demand forecast is included in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions . product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base , the stage of the product life cycle of our products , consumer confidence , and customer acceptance of our products , as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost . if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly , or if we fail to forecast the demand accurately , we could be required to write off inventory , which would negatively impact our gross margin . in order to determine what costs can be included in the valuation of inventory we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities . if the factory loadings are below normal capacity a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs will not be included in the cost of inventory , and therefore , will be recognized as cost of sales in that period , which negatively impacts our gross margin . accounting changes and recent accounting standardsfor a description of accounting changes and recent accounting standards , including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects , if any , on our consolidated condensed financial statements , see Â “ note 2 : accounting changes Â ” and Â “

our microprocessor and chipset products had unit sale decreases compared to q3 2008 . however , with the ramp of intel atom processors and chipsets , overall microprocessor and chipset units were flat . average selling prices for microprocessors and chipsets decreased compared to q3 2008 primarily due to the ramp of intel atom processors and chipsets , which generally have lower average selling prices than our other microprocessor and chipset products . in addition , a decrease in average selling prices for microprocessors within the mobility group operating segment was partially offset by an increase in average selling prices for enterprise microprocessors within the digital enterprise group operating segment . declines in revenue from the sale of communication products , primarily as a result of prior divestitures , and from the sale of wireless connectivity products were offset by an increase in revenue from the sale of nand flash memory products . revenue in the europe , japan , and americas regions decreased by 29 % , 13 % , and 3 % , respectively compared to q3 2008 , while revenue in the asia-pacific region was flat compared to q3 2008 . our overall gross margin dollars for q3 2009 decreased $ 615 Â   million , or 10 % , compared to q3 2008 . our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 57 . 6 % in q3 2009 , from 58 . 9 % in q3 2008 . the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage decrease in the mobility group operating segment . this was partially offset by the gross margin percentage increase in the nand solutions group operating segment . we derived the substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in q3 2009 and most of our overall gross margin dollars in q3 2008 from the sales of microprocessors in the digital enterprise group and mobility group operating segments . see Â “ business outlook Â ” for a discussion of gross margin expectations .

of 2009 decreased 16 % compared to the first nine months of 2008 . the majority of our microprocessor and chipset products had unit sale decreases compared to the first nine months of 2008 . however , the ramp of intel atom processors and chipsets offset the majority of the decrease in overall microprocessor and chipset units . in addition , average selling prices for microprocessors and chipsets decreased compared to the first nine months of 2008 due to the ramp of intel atom processors and chipsets , which generally have lower average selling prices than our other microprocessor and chipset products . revenue from the sale of nor flash memory products and communication products declined approximately $ 660 Â   million , primarily as a result of the divestiture of these businesses . additionally , revenue from the sale of wireless connectivity products declined . revenue in the europe , japan , americas , and asia-pacific regions decreased by 32 % , 20 % , 15 % , and 11 % , respectively compared to the first nine months of 2008 . our overall gross margin dollars for the first nine months of 2009 decreased $ 3 . 8 Â   billion , or 23 % , compared to the first nine months of 2008 . our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 51 . 8 % in the first nine months of 2009 , from 56 . 1 % in the first nine months of 2008 . the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage decrease in the mobility group and digital enterprise group operating segments . this was partially offset by the gross margin percentage increase in the nand solutions group operating segment . we derived most of our overall gross margin dollars in the first nine months of 2009 and 2008 from the sales of microprocessors in the digital enterprise group and mobility group operating segments . see Â “ business outlook Â ” for a discussion of gross margin expectations . the results for the first nine months of 2009 include a charge of $ 1 . 447 Â   billion incurred as a result of the fine imposed by the european commission ( see Â “ note 24 : contingencies Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form

Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) 2006 efficiency programin the third quarter of 2006 , management approved several actions as part of a restructuring plan designed to improve operational efficiency and financial results . restructuring and asset impairment charges were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   ytd 2009 Â   Â   ytd 2008 Â   employee severance and benefit arrangements Â   $ 8 Â   Â   $ 125 Â   asset impairment charges Â   Â   8 Â   Â   Â   334 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   total restructuring and asset impairment charges Â   $ 16 Â   Â   $ 459 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   during q1 2008 , we incurred $ 275 Â   million in additional asset impairment charges related to assets that we sold in q2 2008 in conjunction with the divestiture of our nor flash memory business . we determined the impairment charges using the revised fair value of the equity and note receivable that we received upon completion of the divestiture , less selling costs . the lower fair value was primarily a result of a decline in the outlook for the flash memory market segment . we had previously incurred $ 85 Â   million in asset impairment charges in 2007 related to assets that we sold in q2 2008 in conjunction with the divestiture of our nor flash memory business . we determined the impairment charges based on the fair value , less selling costs , that we expected to receive upon completion of the divestiture . the following table summarizes the restructuring and asset impairment activity for the 2006 efficiency program during the first nine months of 2009 : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   employee Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   severance and Â   Â   asset Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   benefits Â   Â   impairments Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   total Â   accrued restructuring balance as of december Â   27 , 2008 Â   $ 57 Â   Â   $ Â — Â   Â   $ 57 Â   additional accruals Â   Â   18 Â   Â   Â   8 Â   Â   Â   26 Â   adjustments Â   Â   ( 10 ) Â   Â   Â — Â   Â   Â   ( 10 ) cash payments Â   Â   ( 65 ) Â   Â   Â — Â   Â   Â   ( 65 ) non-cash settlements Â   Â   Â — Â   Â   Â   ( 8 ) Â   Â   ( 8 ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   accrued restructuring balance as of september Â   26 , 2009 Â   $ Â — Â   Â   $ Â — Â   Â   $ Â — Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   we recorded the additional accruals , net of adjustments , as restructuring and asset impairment charges . the 2006 efficiency program is substantially complete as of september Â   26 , 2009 . from q3 2006 through q3 2009 , we incurred a total of $ 1 . 6 Â   billion in restructuring and asset impairment charges related to this plan . these charges included a total of $ 686 Â   million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 11 , 300 employees , of which substantially all employees had left the company as of september Â   26 , 2009 . a substantial majority of these employee actions affected employees within manufacturing , information technology , and marketing . the restructuring and asset impairment charges also included $ 896 Â   million in asset impairment charges . amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costsgains ( losses ) on equity method investments , netgains ( losses ) Â   on equity method investments , net were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   ytd 2009 Â   Â   ytd 2008 Â   equity method losses , net Â   $ ( 144 ) Â   $ ( 212 ) impairment charges Â   Â   ( 32 ) Â   Â   ( 261 ) other , net Â   Â   1 Â   Â   Â   13 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   total gains ( losses ) Â   on equity method investments , net Â   $ ( 175 ) Â   $ ( 460 ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   we recognized lower impairment charges and lower equity method losses in the first nine months of 2009 compared to the first nine months of 2008 . impairment charges in the first nine months of 2008 were primarily related to a $ 250 Â   million impairment charge recognized on our investment in numonyx . our equity method losses include losses related to numonyx ( $ 46 Â   million in the first nine months of 2009 and $ 68 Â   million in the first nine months of 2008 ) , clearwire llc ( $ 43 Â   million in the first nine months of 2009 ) , and clearwire corporation ( $ 118 Â   million in the first nine months of 2008 ) .

Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) we used the majority of the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt to repurchase and retire common stock . during the first nine months of 2009 we repurchased 88 . 2 Â   million shares at a cost of $ 1 . 7 Â   billion ( 324 . 1 Â   million shares at a cost of $ 7 . 1 Â   billion during the first nine months of 2008 ) as part of our common stock repurchase program . as of september Â   26 , 2009 , $ 5 . 7 Â   billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization of $ 25 Â   billion . we base our level of stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions , and this level may fluctuate . our dividend payments totaled $ 2 . 3 Â   billion for the first nine months of 2009 , flat compared to the first nine months of 2008 . proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee equity incentive plans totaled $ 367 Â   million for the first nine months of 2009 compared to $ 1 . 1 Â   billion for the first nine months of 2008 , as a result of significantly lower volume of employee exercises of stock options . liquiditycash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity . as of september Â   26 , 2009 , cash and cash equivalents , debt instruments included in trading assets , and short-term investments totaled $ 12 . 9 Â   billion . our investment policy requires all investments with original maturities at the time of investment of up to 6 Â   months to be rated at least a-1 / p-1 by standard & poor Â ’ s / moody Â ’ s , and specifies a higher minimum rating for investments with longer maturities . for instance , investments with maturities of greater than three years require a minimum rating of aa- / aa3 at the time of investment . government regulations imposed on investment alternatives of our non-u . s . Â   subsidiaries , or the absence of a rated counterparties in certain countries , result in some minor exceptions . substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with a / a2 or better rated issuers , and a substantial majority of the issuers are rated aa- / aa3 or better . additionally , we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterparty Â ’ s relative credit standing . as of september Â   26 , 2009 , the total credit exposure to any single counterparty did not exceed $ 500 Â   million . credit rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments . the amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the amounts , if any , by which a counterparty Â ’ s obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty , because we enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions . the credit quality of our investment portfolio remains high during this difficult credit environment , with credit-related other-than-temporary impairment losses on our available-for-sale debt instruments limited to less than $ 55 Â   million cumulatively since the beginning of 2008 . in addition , we continue to be able to invest in high-credit-quality investments . with the exception of a limited amount of investments for which we have recognized other-than-temporary impairments , we have not seen significant liquidation delays , and for those that have matured we have received the full par value of our original debt investments . we do not intend to sell our debt investments that have unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income ( loss ) . in addition , it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell our debt investments that have unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income ( loss ) Â   before we recover the amortized cost basis . as of september Â   26 , 2009 , our balance of cash and cash equivalents , debt instruments included in trading assets , and short-term investments included $ 10 . 7 Â   billion with a remaining maturity of less than one year . as of september Â   26 , 2009 , our cumulative unrealized losses , net of corresponding hedging activities , related to debt instruments classified as trading assets were approximately $ 50 million ( approximately $ 145 Â   million as of december Â   27 , 2008 ) . as of september Â   26 , 2009 , our cumulative unrealized losses related to debt instruments classified as available-for-sale were approximately $ 90 Â   million ( approximately $ 215 Â   million as of december Â   27 , 2008 ) . substantially all of our unrealized losses can be attributed to fair value fluctuations that occurred in an unstable credit environment that resulted in a decrease in the liquidity for these debt instruments . we continually monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and mitigate our credit and interest rate exposures in accordance with the policies approved by our board of directors . we intend to continue to closely monitor future developments in the credit markets and make appropriate changes to our investment policy as deemed necessary . based on our ability to liquidate our investment portfolio and our expected operating cash flows , we do not anticipate any liquidity constraints as a result of either the current credit environment or potential investment fair value fluctuations . our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity . we have an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $ 3 . 0 Â   billion , including through the issuance of commercial paper . maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during the first nine months of 2009 were approximately $ 610 Â   million , although no commercial paper remained outstanding as of september Â   26 , 2009 . our commercial paper was rated a-1 + by standard & poor Â ’ s and p-1 by moody Â ’ s as of september Â   26 , 2009 . we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt , equity , and other securities . we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 Â   months , including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test , working capital requirements , and potential dividends , common stock repurchases , and acquisitions or strategic investments . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) fair value of financial instrumentsfair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date . when determining fair value , we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact , and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability , such as inherent risk , transfer restrictions , and risk of non-performance . credit risk is factored into the valuation of financial instruments that we measure and record at fair value on a recurring basis . when fair value is determined using observable market prices , the credit risk is incorporated into the market price of the financial instrument . when fair value is determined using pricing models , such as a discounted cash flow model , the issuer Â ’ s credit risk and / or intel Â ’ s credit risk is factored into the calculation of the fair value , as appropriate . during the first nine months of 2009 , changes in counterparty credit risk and our own credit risk did not have a significant impact on the valuation of our assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value . when values are determined using inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the values of the instruments being measured , we classify those instruments as level 3 . as of september Â   26 , 2009 , our financial instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 17 . 2 billion of assets , of which $ 1 . 5 Â   billion ( 9 % ) were classified as level 3 . in addition , our financial instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 373 million of liabilities , of which $ 192 Â   million ( 51 % ) were classified as level 3 . during the first nine months of 2009 , we transferred approximately $ 415 Â   million of assets from level 3 to level 2 . these assets consisted of floating-rate notes that were transferred from level 3 to level 2 due to a greater availability of observable market data and / or non-binding market consensus prices to value or corroborate the value of our instruments . during the first nine months of 2009 , we recognized an insignificant amount of gains or losses on the assets that were transferred from level 3 to level 2 . during the first nine months of 2009 , the level 3 assets and liabilities that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis experienced net unrealized fair value gains totaling $ 69 Â   million . of this amount , gains of $ 60 Â   million were recognized in our consolidated condensed statements of operations and gains of $ 9 Â   million were included in other comprehensive income . during the first nine months of 2009 , we did not experience any significant realized gains ( losses ) related to the level 3 assets or liabilities in our portfolio . marketable debt instrumentsas of september Â   26 , 2009 , our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 15 . 9 Â   billion of marketable debt instruments . of these instruments , $ 672 Â   million was classified as level 1 , $ 13 . 7 Â   billion as level 2 , and $ 1 . 5 Â   billion as level 3 . when available , we use observable market prices for identical securities to value our marketable debt instruments . if observable market prices are not available , we use non-binding market consensus prices that we seek to corroborate with observable market data , if available , or non-observable market data . when prices from multiple sources are available for a given instrument , we use observable market quotes to price our instruments , in lieu of prices from other sources . our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 was classified as such due to the usage of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets . marketable debt instruments in this category generally include certain of our floating-rate notes , corporate bonds , and money market fund deposits . management judgment was required to determine our policy that defines the levels at which sufficient volume and frequency of transactions are met for a market to be considered active . our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one-month period prior to the valuation date of each individual instrument , including the number of days each individual instrument trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding amount of the issued instrument . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) approximately 10 % of our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2 was classified as such due to the usage of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in less active markets . when observable market prices for identical securities are not available , we price our marketable debt instruments using : non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data ; quoted market prices for similar instruments ; or pricing models , such as a discounted cash flow model , with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data . non-binding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers . these valuation models incorporate a number of inputs , including non-binding and binding broker quotes ; observable market prices for identical and / or similar securities ; and the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs and to a lesser degree non-observable market inputs . we corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices with observable market data using statistical models when observable market data exist . the discounted cash flow model uses observable market inputs , such as libor-based yield curves , currency spot and forward rates , and credit ratings . approximately 40 % of our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2 was classified as such due to the usage of non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data and approximately 50 % due to the usage of a discounted cash flow model . marketable debt instruments classified as level 2 generally include commercial paper , bank time deposits , municipal bonds , certain of our money market fund deposits , and a majority of floating-rate notes and corporate bonds . our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes . when observable market data is not available , we corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes using unobservable data , if available . marketable debt instruments in this category generally include asset-backed securities and certain of our floating-rate notes and corporate bonds . all of our investments in asset-backed securities were classified as level 3 , and substantially all of them were valued using non-binding market consensus prices that we were not able to corroborate with observable market data due to the lack of transparency in the market for asset-backed securities . equity securitiesas of september Â   26 , 2009 , our portfolio of assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 766 Â   million of marketable equity securities . of these securities , $ 720 million was classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets . our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one-month period prior to the valuation date for each individual security , including the number of days each individual equity security trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding shares of that security . the fair values of our investments in clearwire corporation ( $ 301 Â   million ) and vmware , inc . ( $ 183 Â   million ) constituted a majority of the fair values of the marketable equity securities that we classified as level 1 . marketable equity securities classified as level 2 ( $ 46 Â   million ) were classified as such because their valuations were either based on quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets or adjusted for security-specific restrictions . contractual obligationsduring the third quarter of 2009 , we issued $ 2 . 0 Â   billion of junior subordinated convertible debentures ( the 2009 debentures ) due in 2039 . the 2009 debentures pay a fixed annual rate of 3 . 25 % , to be paid semiannually beginning february Â   1 , 2010 . our total cash payments ( including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on the consolidated condensed balance sheets and excluding fair value adjustments that affect the amount recorded on the consolidated condensed balance sheets ) over the life of this long-term debt obligation are expected to be approximately $ 4 . 0 Â   billion . any future settlement of convertible debt would reduce total interest payments .

Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) despite the company Â ’ s strong execution , we had a net loss per common share for the quarter of $ 0 . 07 , which included the impact of the decision received from the european commission ( ec ) Â   on may Â   13 , 2009 . we recorded the full amount of the fine , Â € from a financial condition perspective , we were able to generate nearly $ 3 . 4 Â   billion in cash from operations and pay $ 784 Â   million in dividends despite being in a net loss position for the quarter . as of june 27 , 2009 , cash and cash equivalents , debt instruments included in trading assets , and short-term investments totaled $ 11 . 3 billion and continued to be of high credit quality . subsequent to the end of the second quarter of 2009 , we completed the acquisition of wind river systems inc . , a leading software vendor in embedded devices , in exchange for $ 884 Â   million to be paid to the stockholders of wind river . with this acquisition we expect to create a new class of differentiated products for the embedded and handheld market segments . strategyour goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide digital economy . as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment , we use our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits , as well as our financial resources , global presence , and brand recognition . we believe that we have the scale , capacity , and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to customers Â ’ needs quickly . some of our key focus areas are listed below : Â   Â • Â   customer orientation . Â   Â • Â   architecture and platforms . Â   Â • Â   silicon and manufacturing technology leadership . Â   Â • Â   strategic investments . Â   Â • Â   business environment and software Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) we believe that the proliferation of the internet , including user demand for premium content and rich media , drives the need for greater performance in pcs and servers . older pcs are increasingly incapable of handling the tasks that users demand , such as streaming video , uploading photos , and online gaming . as these tasks become even more demanding and require more computing power , we believe that users will need and want to buy new pcs to perform everyday tasks on the internet . we also believe that increased internet traffic creates a need for greater server infrastructure , including server products optimized for energy-efficient performance . we believe the trend of mobile microprocessor unit growth outpacing the growth in desktop microprocessor units will continue . we believe that the demand for mobile microprocessors will result in the increased development of products with form factors and uses that require low-power microprocessors . we also believe that these products will result in demand that is incremental to that of microprocessors designed for notebook and desktop computers , as a growing number of households have multiple devices for different computing functions . our silicon and manufacturing technology leadership allows us to develop low-power microprocessors for these and other new uses and form factors . we believe that intel atom processors give us the ability to extend intel architecture and drive growth in new market segments , including a growing number of products that require processors specifically designed for embedded solutions , handheld solutions , consumer electronics devices , nettops , and netbooks . we believe that the common elements for products in these new market segments are low power consumption and the ability to access the internet . to meet the demands of new and evolving mobile markets segments and various embedded market segments , we also offer , and are continuing to develop , system on chip ( soc ) products that integrate core processing functionality with specific components , such as graphics , audio , and video , onto a single chip to form a purpose-built solution . this integration reduces cost , power consumption , and size . in the first quarter of 2009 , we announced plans to collaborate with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company , ltd . ( tsmc ) , a large semiconductor foundry , in an effort to broaden the market opportunities for intel atom processors in soc products by integrating our intel atom processor cores with tsmc Â ’ s process technology platform . we are also focusing on the development of a new highly scalable , many-core architecture aimed at parallel processing . this architecture will initially be used in developing discrete graphics processors designed for gaming and media creation . over time , this architecture may be utilized in the development of products for scientific and professional workstations as well as high-performance computing applications . strategy by operating segmentthe strategy for our digital enterprise group the strategy for our mobility group the strategy for our nand solutions group Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) the strategy for our digital home group the strategy for our digital health group the strategy for our software and services group critical accounting estimatesthe methods , estimates , and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our financial statements . some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments , often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain . our most critical accounting estimates include : Â   Â • Â   the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments , which impact gains ( losses ) Â   on equity method investments , net , or gains ( losses ) Â   on other equity investments , net when we record impairments ; Â   Â • Â   the valuation of investments in debt instruments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments , which impact our investment portfolio balance when we assess fair value , and interest and other , net when we record credit-related impairments of available-for-sale debt instruments ; Â   Â • Â   the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets , which primarily impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation ; Â   Â • Â   the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes ( including the measurement of uncertain tax positions ) , which impact our provision for taxes ; and Â   Â • Â   the valuation of inventory , which impacts gross margin . below , we discuss these policies further , as well as the estimates and judgments involved . we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies , such as those for revenue recognition , including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors ; however , these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective . non-marketable equity investmentsthe carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio , excluding equity derivatives , totaled $ 3 . 7 Â   billion as of june Â   27 , 2009 ( $ 4 . 1 Â   billion as of december Â   27 , 2008 ) . the majority of this balance as of june Â   27 , 2009 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment . our flash memory market segment investments include our investment in im flash technologies , llc ( imft ) Â   of $ 1 . 5 Â   billion ( $ 1 . 7 Â   billion as of december Â   27 , 2008 ) , our investment in im flash singapore , llp ( imfs ) Â   of $ 308 Â   million ( $ 329 Â   million as of december Â   27 , 2008 ) , and our investment in numonyx b . v . of $ 447 Â   million ( $ 484 Â   million as of december Â   27 , 2008 ) . in addition , we regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies , which range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models . for additional information , see Â “ note 10 : equity method investments Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q . our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using adjusted cost basis or the equity method of accounting , depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment . our non-marketable equity investments are classified in other long-term assets on the consolidated condensed balance sheets . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky , and a number of the companies in which we invest are likely to fail . their success is dependent on product development , market acceptance , operational efficiency , and other key business factors . depending on their future prospects , the companies may not be able to raise additional funds when the funds are needed or they may receive lower valuations , with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings , and our investments would likely become impaired . additionally , the current financial markets are extremely volatile and there has been a tightening of the credit markets , which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in , their ability to raise additional capital , and the likelihood of our being able to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings , mergers , and private sales . for further information about our investment portfolio risks , see Â “ risk factors Â ” in part Â   ii , item Â   1a of this form 10-q . we measure the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments quarterly in accordance with fsp 107-1 / apb 28-1 ; however , the investments are only recorded at fair value when the investments are impaired . the assessment of fair value for non-marketable investments is based on the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards ( sfas ) Â   no . Â   157 , Â “ fair value measurements Â ” ( sfas no . 157 ) . for non-marketable equity investments , the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of events or circumstances identified that impact the fair value of the investment , including : Â   Â • Â   the investee Â ’ s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects ; Â   Â • Â   the technological feasibility of the investee Â ’ s products and technologies ; Â   Â • Â   the general market conditions in the investee Â ’ s industry or geographic area , including adverse regulatory or economic changes ; Â   Â • Â   factors related to the investee Â ’ s ability to remain in business , such as the investee Â ’ s liquidity , debt ratios , and the rate at which the investee is using its cash ; and Â   Â • Â   the investee Â ’ s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation . if the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value , we determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired based on our qualitative and quantitative analysis as well as the severity and duration of the impairment . if the investment is considered to be other than temporarily impaired , we write down the investment to its fair value . with the exception of clearwire communications , llc ( clearwire llc ) , the fair value of our non-marketable investments are classified as level 3 when impaired , as we use unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the fair value measurement , and the valuation requires management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices and inherent lack of liquidity . if impaired , the fair value of our investment in clearwire llc would be classified as level 2 , as the unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology are not significant to the fair value measurement . impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $ 39 Â   million in the second quarter of 2009 ( $ 118 Â   million in the first half of 2009 ) . over the past 12 quarters , including the second quarter of 2009 , impairments of non-marketable equity investments have ranged from $ 11 Â   million to $ 896 million per quarter . this range includes impairments of $ 896 Â   million during the fourth quarter of 2008 , which were primarily related to a $ 762 Â   million impairment charge on our investment in clearwire llc . the following is a discussion of the methods , estimates , and judgments that management uses in our analysis to determine if our non-marketable equity investments are other than temporarily impaired . imft / imfsimft and imfs are variable interest entities that are designed to manufacture and sell nand products to intel and micron technology , inc . at manufacturing cost . our nand solutions group operating segment purchases 49 % of these nand products from imft and sells them to our customers . as a result , we generate cash flows from our investments in imft , imfs , and our intangible assets related to the nand product designs through our nand solutions group business . therefore , we determine the fair value of our investments in imft and imfs using the income approach , based on a weighted average of multiple discounted cash flow scenarios of our nand solutions group business . the discounted cash flow scenarios require the use of unobservable inputs , including assumptions of projected revenues ( including product volume , product mix , and average selling prices ) , expenses , capital spending , and other costs , as well as a discount rate . estimates of projected revenues , expenses , capital spending , and other costs are developed by imft , imfs , and intel using historical data and available market data . management also determines how multiple discounted cash flow scenarios are weighted in the fair value determination . additionally , the development of several inputs used in our income model ( such as discount rate ) requires the selection of comparable companies within the nand flash memory market segment . the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors , including nand products and services lines within the flash memory market segment , comparable companies Â ’ sizes , growth rates , and other relevant factors . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) changes in management estimates to the unobservable inputs would change the fair value of the investment . the estimates for the projected revenue and discount rate are the assumptions that most significantly affect the fair value determination . we did not have an other-than-temporary impairment on our investments in imft and imfs in the first half of 2009 or the first half of 2008 . it is reasonably possible that the estimates used in the fair value determination could change in the near term and result in an impairment of our investment . numonyxwe determine the fair value of our investment in numonyx using a combination of the income approach and the market approach . the income approach includes the use of a weighted average of multiple discounted cash flow scenarios of numonyx , which requires the use of unobservable inputs , including assumptions of projected revenues , expenses , capital spending , and other costs , as well as a discount rate calculated based on the risk profile of the flash memory market segment . estimates of projected revenues , expenses , capital spending , and other costs are developed by numonyx and intel . the market approach includes using financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies , such as projected revenues , expenses , and other costs . the selection of comparable companies used in the market approach requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors , including nor products and services lines within the flash memory market segment , comparable companies Â ’ sizes , growth rates , and other relevant factors . changes in management estimates to the unobservable inputs in our valuation models would change the fair value of the investment . the estimated projected revenue is the assumption that most significantly affects the fair value determination . management judgment is also involved in determining how the income approach and the market approach are weighted in the fair value determination . we did not have an other-than-temporary impairment on our investments in numonyx in the first half of 2009 or the first half of 2008 . it is reasonably possible that the estimates used in the fair value determination could change in the near term and result in an impairment of our investment . other non-marketable equity investmentswe determine the fair value of these non-marketable equity investments using the market approach and / or the income approach . the market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies . the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors , including comparable companies Â ’ sizes , growth rates , products and services lines , development stage , and other relevant factors . the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model , which requires the following significant estimates for the investee : revenue , based on assumed market segment size and assumed market segment share ; estimated costs ; and appropriate discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies . estimates of market segment size , market segment share , and costs are developed by the investee and / or intel using historical data and available market data . the valuation of our other non-marketable investments also takes into account movements of the equity and venture capital markets , recent financing activities by the investees , changes in the interest rate environment , the investee Â ’ s capital structure , liquidation preferences for the investee Â ’ s capital , and other economic variables . investments in debt instrumentsfair valuein the current market environment , the assessment of the fair value of debt instruments can be difficult and subjective . rapid changes occurring in today Â ’ s financial markets can lead to changes in the fair value of financial instruments in relatively short periods of time . sfas no . Â   157 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value ( see Â “ note 4 : fair value Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q ) . each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value . level 1 instruments represent quoted prices in active markets . therefore , determining fair value for level 1 instruments does not require significant management judgment , and the estimation is not difficult . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) level 2 instruments include observable inputs other than level 1 prices , such as quoted prices for identical instruments in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions ( less active markets ) , issuer credit ratings , non-binding market consensus prices that can be corroborated with observable market data , model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities , or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities . these level 2 instruments require more management judgment and subjectivity compared to level 1 instruments , including : Â   Â • Â   determining which instruments are most similar to the instrument being priced requires management to identify a sample of similar securities based on the coupon rates , maturity , issuer , credit rating , and instrument type , and subjectively select an individual security or multiple securities that are deemed most similar to the security being priced . Â   Â • Â   determining whether a market is considered active requires management judgment . our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one-month period prior to the valuation date of each individual instrument , including the number of days each individual instrument trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding amount of the issued instrument . Â   Â • Â   determining which model-derived valuations to use in determining fair value requires management judgment . when observable market prices for identical securities or similar securities are not available , we price our marketable debt instruments using non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data or pricing models , such as discounted cash flow models , with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data . level 3 instruments include unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities . the determination of fair value for level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity . most of our marketable debt instruments classified as level 3 are valued using a non-binding market consensus price or a non-binding broker quote , both of which we corroborate with unobservable data . non-binding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers . these valuation models incorporate a number of inputs , including non-binding and binding broker quotes ; observable market prices for identical and / or similar securities ; and the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs , and to a lesser degree non-observable market inputs . adjustments to the fair value of instruments priced using non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes , and classified as level 3 , were not significant in the second quarter of 2009 . other-than-temporary impairmentafter determining the fair value of our available-for-sale debt instruments , gains or losses on these investments are recorded to other comprehensive income ( loss ) , until either the investment is sold or we determine that the decline in value is other-than-temporary . determining whether the decline in fair value is other-than-temporary requires management judgment based on the specific facts and circumstances of each investment . for investments in debt instruments , these judgments primarily consider the financial condition and liquidity of the issuer , the issuer Â ’ s credit rating , and any specific events that may cause us to believe that the debt instrument will not mature and be paid in full ; if we have the intent to sell the investment ; and if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell an investment that has unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income ( loss ) Â   before we recover the amortized cost basis . given the current market conditions , these judgments could prove to be wrong , and companies with relatively high credit ratings and solid financial conditions may not be able to fulfill their obligations . for available-for-sale debt instruments that are considered other-than-temporarily impaired and that we do not intend to sell and will not be required to sell prior to recovery of our amortized cost basis , we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors . the credit loss component is recognized in earnings and is the difference between the debt instrument Â ’ s amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows . the remaining difference between the debt instrument Â ’ s fair value and the present value of future expected cash flows is due to factors that are not credit related and is recognized in other comprehensive income ( loss ) . as of june Â   27 , 2009 , our investments included $ 11 . 7 Â   billion of available-for-sale debt instruments . we have recognized less than $ 55 Â   million of credit-related other-than-temporary impairment losses in earnings on our available-for-sale debt instruments cumulatively since the beginning of 2008 . as of june Â   27 , 2009 , our cumulative unrealized losses related to debt instruments classified as available-for-sale were approximately $ 165 Â   million ( approximately $ 215 Â   million as of december Â   27 , 2008 ) . as of june Â   27 , 2009 , this amount included approximately $ 110 Â   million of unrecognized losses that could be recognized in the future . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) long-lived assetswe assess the impairment of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable . factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations , significant negative industry or economic trends , and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets . we measure the recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows . if an asset grouping Â ’ s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows , the asset grouping is considered to be impaired . the impairment is measured by comparing the difference between the asset grouping Â ’ s carrying value and its fair value . the assessment of fair value is based on the provisions of sfas no . Â   157 . long-lived assets such as goodwill ; intangible assets ; and property , plant and equipment are considered non-financial assets , and are recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized . impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows . due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity , we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings . in addition , as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions , we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets , primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements . when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated , we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets Â ’ new , shorter useful lives . over the past 12 quarters , including the second quarter of 2009 , impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets ranged from $ 25 Â   million to $ 320 million per quarter . for further discussion on asset impairment charges , see Â “ note 16 : restructuring and asset impairment charges Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q . income taxeswe must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes . these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits , benefits , and deductions , and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities , which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes , as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions . significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period . we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets . if recovery is not likely , we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable . we believe that we will ultimately recover a majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated condensed balance sheets . however , should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets , our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely . changes in management Â ’ s plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes . the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations . we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process . the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit , including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes , if any . if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit , the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 % likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement . it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts , as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes . we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis . this evaluation is based on factors including , but not limited to , changes in facts or circumstances , changes in tax law , effectively settled issues under audit , and new audit activity . such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) inventorythe valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality . the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products . the estimate of future demand is compared to work in process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount , if any , of obsolete or excess inventory . as of june Â   27 , 2009 , we had total work-in-process inventory of $ 1 , 209 million and total finished goods inventory of $ 1 , 211 Â   million . the demand forecast is included in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions . product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base , the stage of the product life cycle of our products , consumer confidence , and customer acceptance of our products , as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost . if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly , or if we fail to forecast the demand accurately , we could be required to write off inventory , which would negatively impact our gross margin . in order to determine what costs can be included in the valuation of inventory we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities . if the factory loadings are below normal capacity a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs will not be included in the cost of inventory , and therefore , will be recognized as cost of sales in that period , which negatively impacts our gross margin . accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncementsfor a description of accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements , including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects , if any , on our consolidated condensed financial statements , see Â “ note 2 : accounting changes Â ” and Â “ note 3 : recent accounting pronouncements Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q .

Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) 2006 efficiency programin the third quarter of 2006 , management approved several actions as part of a restructuring plan designed to improve operational efficiency and financial results . restructuring and asset impairment charges were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   ytd 2009 Â   Â   ytd 2008 Â   employee severance and benefit arrangements Â   $ 8 Â   Â   $ 96 Â   asset impairment charges Â   Â   8 Â   Â   Â   329 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   total restructuring and asset impairment charges Â   $ 16 Â   Â   $ 425 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   during q1 2008 , we incurred $ 275 Â   million in additional asset impairment charges related to assets that we sold in q2 2008 in conjunction with the divestiture of our nor flash memory business . we determined the impairment charges using the revised fair value of the equity and note receivable that we received upon completion of the divestiture , less selling costs . the lower fair value was primarily a result of a decline in the outlook for the flash memory market segment . we had previously incurred $ 85 Â   million in asset impairment charges in 2007 related to assets that we sold in conjunction with the divestiture of our nor flash memory business . we determined the impairment charges based on the fair value , less selling costs , that we expected to receive upon completion of the divestiture . the following table summarizes the restructuring and asset impairment activity for the 2006 efficiency program during the first half of 2009 : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   employee Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   severance and Â   Â   asset Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   benefits Â   Â   impairments Â   Â   total Â   accrued restructuring balance as of december Â   27 , 2008 Â   $ 57 Â   Â   $ Â — Â   Â   $ 57 Â   additional accruals Â   Â   16 Â   Â   Â   8 Â   Â   Â   24 Â   adjustments Â   Â   ( 8 ) Â   Â   Â — Â   Â   Â   ( 8 ) cash payments Â   Â   ( 37 ) Â   Â   Â — Â   Â   Â   ( 37 ) non-cash settlements Â   Â   Â — Â   Â   Â   ( 8 ) Â   Â   ( 8 ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   accrued restructuring balance as of june Â   27 , 2009 Â   $ 28 Â   Â   $ Â — Â   Â   $ 28 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   we recorded the additional accruals , net of adjustments , as restructuring and asset impairment charges . the remaining accrual as of june Â   27 , 2009 was related to severance benefits that are recorded within accrued compensation and benefits . from q3 2006 through q2 2009 , we incurred a total of $ 1 . 6 Â   billion in restructuring and asset impairment charges related to this plan . these charges included a total of $ 686 Â   million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 11 , 300 employees , of which 11 , 000 employees had left the company as of june Â   27 , 2009 . a substantial majority of these employee actions affected employees within manufacturing , information technology , and marketing . we paid $ 658 Â   million of the employee severance and benefit charges incurred as of june Â   27 , 2009 . the restructuring and asset impairment charges also included $ 896 Â   million in asset impairment charges . gains ( losses ) on equity method investments , netgains ( losses ) Â   on equity method investments , net were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   ytd 2009 Â   Â   ytd 2008 Â   equity method losses , net Â   $ ( 103 ) Â   $ ( 92 ) impairment charges Â   Â   ( 13 ) Â   Â   ( 4 ) other , net Â   Â   Â — Â   Â   Â   1 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   total gains ( losses ) Â   on equity method investments , net Â   $ ( 116 ) Â   $ ( 95 ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   net losses on equity method investments were $ 116 Â   million in the first half of 2009 compared to $ 95 million in the first half of 2008 . we recognized higher equity method losses and higher impairment charges in the first half of 2009 compared to the first half of 2008 . our equity method losses include losses related to numonyx ( $ 37 Â   million in the first half of 2009 ) and clearwire llc ( $ 27 million in the first half of 2009 ) . equity method losses in the first half of 2008 also included $ 76 Â   million from clearwire corporation .

Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) financing activitiesfinancing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases and retirement of common stock , payment of dividends to stockholders , and proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans . the decrease in cash used for financing activities in the first half of 2009 , compared to the first half of 2008 , was primarily due to the absence of repurchases and retirement of common stock as part of our common stock repurchase program in the first half of 2009 , partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans . in the first half of 2008 , we repurchased $ 5 . 1 Â   billion , including the purchase of 230 . 7 Â   million shares of common stock as part of our common stock repurchase program . as of june Â   27 , 2009 , $ 7 . 4 Â   billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization of $ 25 Â   billion . we base our level of stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions , and this level may fluctuate . our dividend payment was $ 1 . 6 Â   billion in the first half of 2009 , slightly higher than the $ 1 . 5 Â   billion paid in the first half of 2008 . proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee equity incentive plans totaled $ 248 Â   million for the first half of 2009 compared to $ 828 Â   million for the first half of 2008 , as a result of a lower volume of employee exercises of stock options . liquiditycash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity . as of june Â   27 , 2009 , cash and cash equivalents , debt instruments included in trading assets , and short-term investments totaled $ 11 . 3 Â   billion . our investment policy requires all investments with original maturities at the time of investment of up to 6 Â   months to be rated at least a-1 / p-1 by standard & poor Â ’ s / moody Â ’ s , and specifies a higher minimum rating for investments with longer maturities . for instance , investments with maturities of greater than three years require a minimum rating of aa- / aa3 at the time of investment . government regulations imposed on investment alternatives of our non-u . s . subsidiaries , or the absence of a rated counterparties in certain countries , result in some minor exceptions . substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with a / a2 or better rated issuers , and a substantial majority of the issuers are rated aa- / aa3 or better . additionally , we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterparty Â ’ s relative credit standing . as of june Â   27 , 2009 , the total credit exposure to any single counterparty did not exceed $ 500 Â   million . credit rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments . the amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the amounts , if any , by which a counterparty Â ’ s obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty , because we enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions subject to international swaps and derivatives association , inc . ( isda ) Â   agreements . the credit quality of our investment portfolio remains high during this difficult credit environment , with credit-related other-than-temporary impairment losses on our available-for-sale debt instruments limited to less than $ 55 Â   million cumulatively since the beginning of 2008 . in addition , we continue to be able to invest in high-quality investments . with the exception of a limited amount of investments for which we have recognized other-than-temporary impairments , we have not seen significant liquidation delays , and for those that have matured we have received the full par value of our original debt investments . we do not intend to sell our debt investments that have unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income ( loss ) . in addition , it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell our debt investments that have unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income ( loss ) Â   before we recover the amortized cost basis . as of june Â   27 , 2009 , our balance of cash and cash equivalents , debt instruments included in trading assets , and short-term investments included $ 9 . 7 Â   billion with a remaining maturity of less than one year . as of june Â   27 , 2009 , our cumulative unrealized losses , net of corresponding hedging activities , related to debt instruments classified as trading assets were approximately $ 85 Â   million ( approximately $ 145 Â   million as of december Â   27 , 2008 ) . as of june Â   27 , 2009 , our cumulative unrealized losses related to debt instruments classified as available-for-sale were approximately $ 165 Â   million ( approximately $ 215 Â   million as of december Â   27 , 2008 ) . substantially all of our unrealized losses can be attributed to fair value fluctuations in an unstable credit environment that resulted in a decrease in the market liquidity for debt instruments . we continually monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and mitigate our credit and interest rate exposures in accordance with the policies approved by our board of directors . we intend to continue to closely monitor future developments in the credit markets and make appropriate changes to our investment policy as deemed necessary . based on our ability to liquidate our investment portfolio and our expected operating cash flows , we do not anticipate any liquidity constraints as a result of either the current credit environment or potential investment fair value fluctuations . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity . we have an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $ 3 . 0 Â   billion , including through the issuance of commercial paper . maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during the first half of 2009 were approximately $ 610 Â   million , although no commercial paper remained outstanding as of june Â   27 , 2009 . our commercial paper was rated a-1 + by standard & poor Â ’ s and p-1 by moody Â ’ s as of june Â   27 , 2009 . we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt , equity , and other securities . subsequent to the second quarter of 2009 , we issued $ 2 . 0 Â   billion of 3 . 25 % junior subordinated convertible debentures due in 2039 . we utilized the majority of the proceeds to repurchase shares of our common stock . see Â “ note 17 : borrowings Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q . we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 Â   months , including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test , working capital requirements , and potential dividends , common stock repurchases , and acquisitions or strategic investments . additionally , subsequent to the second quarter of 2009 , cash outlays related to the following have occurred or are expected to occur in the near the future : Â   Â • Â   ec fine of Â € Â   Â • Â   acquisition of wind river , in exchange for $ 884 Â   million to be paid to the stockholders of wind river . fair value of financial instrumentsthe assessment of fair value for our financial instruments is based on the provisions of sfas no . 157 . sfas no . Â   157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value . observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party , whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability . a financial instrument Â ’ s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement . credit risk is factored into the valuation of financial instruments that we measure and record at fair value on a recurring basis . when fair value is determined using observable market prices , the credit risk is incorporated into the market price of the financial instrument . when fair value is determined using pricing models , such as a discounted cash flow model , the issuer Â ’ s credit risk and / or intel Â ’ s credit risk is factored into the calculation of the fair value , as appropriate . during the first half of 2009 , the valuation of our liabilities measured and recorded at fair value as well as our derivative instruments in a current or potential net liability position were not impacted by changes in our credit risk . in addition , changes in counterparty credit risk did not have a significant impact on the valuation of either our marketable debt instruments , loans receivable , or derivative instruments in a current or potential net asset position during the first half of 2009 . when values are determined using inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the values of the instruments being measured , we classify those instruments as level 3 under the sfas no . Â   157 hierarchy . as of june Â   27 , 2009 , our financial instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 15 . 2 Â   billion of assets , of which $ 1 . 4 Â   billion ( 9 % ) were classified as level 3 . in addition , our financial instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 315 Â   million of liabilities , of which $ 172 Â   million ( 55 % ) were classified as level 3 . during the first half of 2009 , we transferred approximately $ 365 Â   million of assets from level 3 to level 2 . these assets consisted of floating-rate notes that were transferred from level 3 to level 2 due to a greater availability of observable market data and / or non-binding market consensus prices to value or corroborate the value of our instruments . during the first half of 2009 , we recognized an insignificant amount of gains or losses on the assets that were transferred from level 3 to level 2 . during the first half of 2009 , the level 3 assets and liabilities that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis experienced net unrealized fair value gains totaling $ 20 Â   million . of this amount , gains of $ 54 Â   million were recognized in our consolidated condensed statements of operations and losses of $ 34 Â   million were included in other comprehensive income ( loss ) . we believe the losses included in other comprehensive income ( loss ) Â   represent a temporary decline in the fair value of available-for-sale investments . during the first half of 2009 , we did not experience any significant realized gains ( losses ) Â   related to the level 3 assets or liabilities in our portfolio . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) marketable debt instrumentsas of june Â   27 , 2009 , our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 14 . 0 Â   billion of marketable debt instruments . of these instruments , approximately $ 1 . 1 Â   billion was classified as level 1 , approximately $ 11 . 5 Â   billion as level 2 , and approximately $ 1 . 4 Â   billion as level 3 . when available , we use observable market prices for identical securities to value our marketable debt instruments . if observable market prices are not available , we use non-binding market consensus prices that we seek to corroborate with observable market data , if available , or non-observable market data . when prices from multiple sources are available for a given instrument , we use observable market quotes to price our instruments , in lieu of prices from other sources . our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 was classified as such due to the usage of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets . marketable debt instruments in this category generally include certain of our floating-rate notes , corporate bonds , and money market fund deposits . management judgment was required to determine our policy that defines the levels at which sufficient volume and frequency of transactions are met for a market to be considered active . our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one-month period prior to the valuation date of each individual instrument , including the number of days each individual instrument trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding amount of the issued instrument . approximately 15 % of our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2 was classified as such due to the usage of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in less active markets . when observable market prices for identical securities are not available , we price our marketable debt instruments using : non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data ; quoted market prices for similar instruments ; or pricing models , such as a discounted cash flow model , with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data . non-binding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers . these valuation models incorporate a number of inputs , including non-binding and binding broker quotes ; observable market prices for identical and / or similar securities ; and the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs and to a lesser degree non-observable market inputs . we corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices with observable market data using statistical models when observable market data exist . the discounted cash flow model uses observable market inputs , such as libor-based yield curves , currency spot and forward rates , and credit ratings . approximately 45 % of our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2 was classified as such due to the usage of non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data and approximately 40 % due to the usage of a discounted cash flow model . marketable debt instruments classified as level 2 generally include commercial paper , bank time deposits , municipal bonds , certain of our money market fund deposits and corporate bonds , and a majority of floating-rate notes . our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes . when observable market data is not available , we corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes using unobservable data , if available . marketable debt instruments in this category generally include asset-backed securities and certain of our floating-rate notes and corporate bonds . all of our investments in asset-backed securities were classified as level 3 , and substantially all of them were valued using non-binding market consensus prices that we were not able to corroborate with observable market data due to the lack of transparency in the market for asset-backed securities . equity securitiesas of june Â   27 , 2009 , our portfolio of assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 513 Â   million of marketable equity securities . of these securities , $ 493 Â   million was classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets . our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one-month period prior to the valuation date for each individual security , including the number of days each individual equity security trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding shares of that security . the fair values of our investments in clearwire corporation ( $ 179 Â   million ) and vmware , inc . ( $ 133 Â   million ) constituted a majority of the fair values of the marketable equity securities that we classified as level 1 . the remaining marketable equity securities ( $ 20 Â   million ) were classified as level 2 because their valuations were either based on quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets or adjusted for security-specific restrictions . as of june Â   27 , 2009 , our portfolio of assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 319 Â   million of equity securities offsetting deferred compensation . all of these securities were classified as level 1 , because their valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) contractual obligationsduring the second quarter of 2009 , we agreed to acquire all outstanding common shares of wind river for $ 884 Â   million to be paid to the stockholders of wind river . we completed the acquisition subsequent to the end of the second quarter of 2009 . subsequent to the end of the second quarter of 2009 , we issued $ 2 . 0 Â   billion of junior subordinated convertible debentures ( the 2009 debentures ) due in 2039 . the 2009 debentures pay a fixed rate of 3 . 25 % cash interest semiannually beginning february Â   1 , 2010 . our total anticipated cash payments ( including anticipated interest payments that will not be recorded on the consolidated condensed balance sheets and excluding fair value adjustments that affect the amount recorded on the consolidated condensed balance sheets ) over the life of this long-term debt obligation are expected to be approximately $ 4 . 0 billion . any future settlement of convertible debt would reduce anticipated interest and / or principal payments .

Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) our tax rate decreased from prior periods due to the first quarter settlement of various federal and state tax matters related to prior years and as a result of a higher percentage of our profits coming from lower tax jurisdictions . we expect the concentration of profits in lower tax jurisdictions to continue in 2009 and expect our tax rate to be approximately 24 % for the second , third , and fourth quarters of 2009 . our product lineup is extremely well positioned across the spectrum of computing . in the first quarter we extended our competitive advantage in the enterprise market segment with the release of the intel Â ® tmfrom a financial condition perspective , we ended the first quarter of 2009 with an investment portfolio valued at $ 12 . 8 Â   billion , consisting of cash and cash equivalents , debt instruments included in trading assets , and short- and long-term investments . the credit quality of our investment portfolio remains high during this difficult credit environment , with other-than-temporary impairments on our available-for-sale debt instruments limited to $ 7 Â   million in the first quarter of 2009 and $ 51 Â   million cumulatively since the beginning of 2008 . in addition , we continue to be able to invest in high-quality investments . however , we have seen a reduction in the volume of available commercial paper from certain market segments . as a result , our investments in short-term government funds have increased , which will reduce our average investment return . despite the continued tightness of the credit markets , we continue to be able to access funds through the credit markets , including through the issuance of commercial paper . with the exception of a limited amount of investments for which we have recognized other-than-temporary impairments , we have not seen significant liquidation delays , and for those that have matured we have received the full par value of our original debt investments . for additional details on our investment portfolio , see Â “ liquidity and capital resources . Â ” during the first quarter of 2009 , we paid $ 779 Â   million to stockholders as dividends , and in march , our board of directors declared a dividend of $ 0 . 14 per common share to be paid in june . strategyour goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide digital economy . as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment , we use our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits , as well as our financial resources , global presence , and brand recognition . we believe that we have the scale , capacity , and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to customers Â ’ needs quickly . some of our key focus areas are listed below : Â   Â • Â   customer orientation . Â   Â • Â   architecture and platforms . Â   Â • Â   silicon and manufacturing technology leadership . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   Â • Â   strategic investments . Â   Â • Â   business environment and softwarewe believe that the proliferation of the internet , including user demand for premium content and rich media , drives the need for greater performance in pcs and servers . a growing number of older pcs are increasingly incapable of handling the tasks that users demand , such as streaming video , uploading photos , and online gaming . as these tasks become even more demanding and require more computing power , we believe that users will need and want to buy new pcs to perform everyday tasks on the internet . we also believe that increased internet traffic creates a need for greater server infrastructure , including server products optimized for energy-efficient performance . while in the first quarter of 2009 sales declined more significantly for mg versus deg , we believe that the trend of mobile microprocessor unit growth outpacing the growth in desktop microprocessor units will eventually resume . we believe that the demand for mobile microprocessors will result in the increased development of products with form factors and uses that require low-power microprocessors . our silicon and manufacturing technology leadership allows us to develop low-power microprocessors for new uses and form factors . we believe that these low-power microprocessors give us the ability to extend intel architecture and drive growth in new market segments , including a growing number of products that require processors specifically designed for embedded solutions , mobile internet devices ( mids ) , consumer electronics devices , nettops , and netbooks . we believe that the common elements for products in these new market segments are low power consumption and the ability to access the internet . to meet the demands of new and evolving mobile markets segments , we also offer , and are continuing to develop , system on chip ( soc ) products that integrate core processing functionality with specific components , such as graphics , audio , and video , onto a single chip to form a purpose-built solution . this integration reduces cost , power consumption , and size . in the first quarter of 2009 , we announced plans to collaborate with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company , ltd .

Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using adjusted cost basis or the equity method of accounting , depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment . our non-marketable equity investments are classified in other long-term assets on the consolidated condensed balance sheets . non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky , and a number of the companies in which we invest are likely to fail . their success is dependent on product development , market acceptance , operational efficiency , and other key business factors . depending on their future prospects , the companies may not be able to raise additional funds when the funds are needed or they may receive lower valuations , with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings , and our investments would likely become impaired . additionally , the current financial markets are extremely volatile and there has been a tightening of the credit markets , which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in , their ability to raise additional capital , and the likelihood of our being able to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings , mergers , and private sales . for further information about our investment portfolio risks , including those specific to our investments in the flash memory market segment , see Â “ risk factors Â ” in part Â   ii , item Â   1a of this form 10-q . we review our investments quarterly for indicators of impairment . for non-marketable equity investments , the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would significantly harm the fair value of the investment . the indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances primarily include : Â   Â • Â   the investee Â ’ s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects ; Â   Â • Â   the technological feasibility of the investee Â ’ s products and technologies ; Â   Â • Â   the general market conditions in the investee Â ’ s industry or geographic area , including adverse regulatory or economic changes ; Â   Â • Â   factors related to the investee Â ’ s ability to remain in business , such as the investee Â ’ s liquidity , debt ratios , and the rate at which the investee is using its cash ; and Â   Â • Â   the investee Â ’ s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation . investments that we identify as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the fair value of the investment is below our carrying value . if the fair value of the investment is below our carrying value , we determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired based on the severity and duration of the impairment . if the investment is considered to be other than temporarily impaired , we write down the investment to its fair value . the assessment of fair value for non-marketable investments is based on the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards ( sfas ) Â   no . Â   157 , Â “ fair value measurements Â ” ( sfas no . Â   157 ) , as amended . with the exception of clearwire communications , llc ( clearwire llc ) , the fair value of our non-marketable investments are classified as level 3 when impaired , as we use unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the fair value measurement , and the valuation requires management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices and inherent lack of liquidity . if impaired , the fair value of our investment in clearwire llc would be classified as level 2 , as the unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology are not significant to the fair value measurement . impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $ 79 Â   million in the first quarter of 2009 . over the past 12 quarters , including the first quarter of 2009 , impairments of non-marketable equity investments have ranged from $ 10 Â   million to $ 896 Â   million per quarter . this range includes impairments of $ 896 Â   million during the fourth quarter of 2008 , which were primarily related to a $ 762 Â   million impairment charge on our investment in clearwire llc . the following is a discussion of the methods , estimates , and judgments that management uses in our analysis to determine if our non-marketable equity investments are other than temporarily impaired . imft / imfsimft and imfs are variable interest entities that are designed to manufacture and sell nand products to intel and micron technology , inc . at manufacturing cost . our nand solutions group operating segment purchases 49 % of these nand products from imft and sells them to our customers . as a result , we generate cash flows from our investments in imft , imfs , and our intangible assets related to the nand product designs through our nand solutions group business . therefore , we determine the fair value of our investments in imft and imfs using the income approach , based on a weighted average of multiple discounted cash flow scenarios of our nand solutions group business . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) the discounted cash flow scenarios require the use of unobservable inputs , including assumptions of projected revenues ( including product volume , product mix , and average selling prices ) , expenses , capital spending , and other costs , as well as a discount rate . estimates of projected revenues , expenses , capital spending , and other costs are developed by imft , imfs , and intel using historical data and available market data . management also determines how multiple discounted cash flow scenarios are weighted in the fair value determination . additionally , the development of several inputs used in our income model ( such as discount rate ) requires the selection of comparable companies within the nand flash memory market segment . the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors , including nand products and services lines within the flash memory market segment , comparable companies Â ’ sizes , growth rates , and other relevant factors . changes in management estimates to the unobservable inputs would change the fair value of the investment . the estimates for the projected revenue and discount rate are the assumptions that most significantly affect the fair value determination . we did not have an other-than-temporary impairment on our investments in imft and imfs in the first quarters of 2009 and 2008 . it is reasonably possible that the estimates used in the fair value determination could change in the near term and result in an impairment of our investment . numonyxwe determine the fair value of our investment in numonyx using a combination of the income approach and the market approach . the income approach includes the use of a weighted average of multiple discounted cash flow scenarios of numonyx , which requires the use of unobservable inputs , including assumptions of projected revenues , expenses , capital spending , and other costs , as well as a discount rate calculated based on the risk profile of the flash memory market segment . estimates of projected revenues , expenses , capital spending , and other costs are developed by numonyx and intel . the market approach includes using financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies , such as projected revenues , expenses , and other costs . the selection of comparable companies used in the market approach requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors , including nor products and services lines within the flash memory market segment , comparable companies Â ’ sizes , growth rates , and other relevant factors . changes in management estimates to the unobservable inputs in our valuation models would change the fair value of the investment . the estimated projected revenue is the assumption that most significantly affects the fair value determination . management judgment is also involved in determining how the income approach and the market approach are weighted in the fair value determination . we did not have an other-than-temporary impairment on our investments in numonyx in the first quarter of 2009 . it is reasonably possible that the estimates used in the fair value determination could change in the near term and result in an impairment of our investment . other non-marketable equity investmentswe determine the fair value of these non-marketable equity investments using the market approach and / or the income approach . the market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies . the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors , including comparable companies Â ’ sizes , growth rates , products and services lines , development stage , and other relevant factors . the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model , which requires the following significant estimates for the investee : revenue , based on assumed market segment size and assumed market segment share ; estimated costs ; and appropriate discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies . estimates of market segment size , market segment share , and costs are developed by the investee and / or intel using historical data and available market data . the valuation of our other non-marketable investments also takes into account movements of the equity and venture capital markets , recent financing activities by the investees , changes in the interest rate environment , the investee Â ’ s capital structure , liquidation preferences for the investee Â ’ s capital , and other economic variables . investments in debt instrumentsfair valuein the current market environment , the assessment of the fair value of debt instruments can be difficult and subjective . the volume of trading activity of certain debt instruments has declined , and the rapid changes occurring in today Â ’ s financial markets can lead to changes in the fair value of financial instruments in relatively short periods of time . sfas no . Â   157 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value ( see Â “ note 4 : fair value Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q ) . each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) level 1 instruments represent quoted prices in active markets . therefore , determining fair value for level 1 instruments does not require significant management judgment , and the estimation is not difficult . level 2 instruments include observable inputs other than level 1 prices , such as quoted prices for identical instruments in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions ( less active markets ) , issuer credit ratings , non-binding market consensus prices that can be corroborated with observable market data , model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities , or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities . these level 2 instruments require more management judgment and subjectivity compared to level 1 instruments , including : Â   Â • Â   determining which instruments are most similar to the instrument being priced requires management to identify a sample of similar securities based on the coupon rates , maturity , issuer , credit rating , and instrument type , and subjectively select an individual security or multiple securities that are deemed most similar to the security being priced . Â   Â • Â   determining whether a market is considered active requires management judgment . our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one-month period prior to the valuation date of each individual instrument , including the number of days each individual instrument trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding amount of the issued instrument . Â   Â • Â   determining which model-derived valuations to use in determining fair value requires management judgment . when observable market prices for identical securities or similar securities are not available , we price our marketable debt instruments using non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data or pricing models , such as discounted cash flow models , with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data . level 3 instruments include unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities . the determination of fair value for level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity . most of our marketable debt instruments classified as level 3 are valued using a non-binding market consensus price or a non-binding broker quote , both of which we corroborate with unobservable data . non-binding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers . these valuation models incorporate a number of inputs , including non-binding and binding broker quotes ; observable market prices for identical and / or similar securities ; and the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs , and to a lesser degree non-observable market inputs . adjustments to the fair value of instruments priced using non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes , and classified as level 3 , were not significant in the first quarter of 2009 . other-than-temporary impairmentafter determining the fair value of our available-for-sale debt instruments , gains or losses on these investments are recorded to other comprehensive income , until either the investment is sold or we determine that the decline in value is other-than-temporary . determining whether the decline in fair value is other-than-temporary requires management judgment based on the specific facts and circumstances of each investment . for investments in debt instruments , these judgments primarily consider the financial condition and liquidity of the issuer , the issuer Â ’ s credit rating , and any specific events that may cause us to believe that the debt instrument will not mature and be paid in full ; and our ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity . given the current market conditions , these judgments could prove to be wrong , and companies with relatively high credit ratings and solid financial conditions may not be able to fulfill their obligations . as of march Â   28 , 2009 , our investments included $ 10 . 1 Â   billion of available-for-sale debt instruments . during the first quarter of 2009 , we recognized $ 7 Â   million in other-than-temporary impairments on our available-for-sale debt instruments ( $ 51 Â   million cumulatively since the beginning of 2008 ) . as of march Â   28 , 2009 , our cumulative unrealized losses related to debt instruments classified as available-for-sale were approximately $ 230 Â   million ( approximately $ 215 million as of december Â   27 , 2008 ) . as of march Â   28 , 2009 , this amount included approximately $ 180 million of unrecognized losses that could be recognized in the future if our other-than-temporary assessment changes . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) long-lived assetswe assess the impairment of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable . factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations , significant negative industry or economic trends , and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets . we measure the recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows . if an asset grouping Â ’ s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows , the asset grouping is considered to be impaired . the impairment is measured by comparing the difference between the asset grouping Â ’ s carrying value and its fair value , based on the best information available , including use of the market approach or the income approach , including the use of discounted cash flow models . long-lived assets such as goodwill ; intangible assets ; and property , plant and equipment are considered non-financial assets , and are carried at fair value only when an impairment charge is recorded . impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows . due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity , we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings . in addition , as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions , we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets , primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements . when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated , we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets Â ’ new , shorter useful lives . over the past 12 quarters , including the first quarter of 2009 , impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets ranged from $ 15 Â   million to $ 320 million per quarter . for further discussion on asset impairment charges , see Â “ note 13 : restructuring and asset impairment charges Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q . income taxeswe must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes . these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits , benefits , and deductions , and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities , which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes , as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions . significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period . we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets . if recovery is not likely , we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable . we believe that we will ultimately recover a majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated condensed balance sheets . however , should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets , our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely . changes in management Â ’ s plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes . the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations . we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process . the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit , including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes , if any . if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit , the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 % likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement . it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts , as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes . we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis . this evaluation is based on factors including , but not limited to , changes in facts or circumstances , changes in tax law , effectively settled issues under audit , and new audit activity . such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) inventorythe valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality . the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products . the estimate of future demand is compared to work in process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount , if any , of obsolete or excess inventory . as of march Â   28 , 2009 , we had total work-in-process inventory of $ 1 , 448 Â   million and total finished goods inventory of $ 1 , 217 Â   million . the demand forecast is included in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions . product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base , the stage of the product life cycle of our products , consumer confidence , and customer acceptance of our products , as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost . if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly , or if we fail to forecast the demand accurately , we could be required to write off inventory , which would negatively impact our gross margin . accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncementsfor a description of accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements , including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects , if any , on our consolidated condensed financial statements , see Â “ note 2 : accounting changes Â ” and Â “ note 3 : recent accounting pronouncements Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q . results of operations first quarter of 2009 compared to first quarter of 2008the following table sets forth certain consolidated condensed statements of income data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   q12009 Â   Â   q12008 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   % of net Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   % of net Â   ( dollars in millions , except per share amounts ) Â   dollars Â   Â   revenue Â   Â   dollars Â   Â   revenue Â   net revenue Â   $ 7 , 145 Â   Â   Â   100 . 0 % Â   $ 9 , 673 Â   Â   Â   100 . 0 % cost of sales Â   Â   3 , 907 Â   Â   Â   54 . 7 % Â   Â   4 , 466 Â   Â   Â   46 . 2 % Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   gross margin Â   Â   3 , 238 Â   Â   Â   45 . 3 % Â   Â   5 , 207 Â   Â   Â   53 . 8 % research and development Â   Â   1 , 317 Â   Â   Â   18 . 4 % Â   Â   1 , 467 Â   Â   Â   15 . 2 % marketing , general and administrative Â   Â   1 , 200 Â   Â   Â   16 . 8 % Â   Â   1 , 349 Â   Â   Â   13 . 9 % restructuring and asset impairment charges Â   Â   74 Â   Â   Â   1 . 0 % Â   Â   329 Â   Â   Â   3 . 4 % Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   operating income Â   Â   647 Â   Â   Â   9 . 1 % Â   Â   2 , 062 Â   Â   Â   21 . 3 % gains ( losses ) Â   on equity method investments , net Â   Â   ( 72 ) Â   Â   ( 1 . 0 ) % Â   Â   ( 52 ) Â   Â   ( 0 . 5 ) % gains ( losses ) Â   on other equity investments , net Â   Â   ( 41 ) Â   Â   ( 0 . 6 ) % Â   Â   ( 7 ) Â   Â   ( 0 . 1 ) % interest and other , net Â   Â   95 Â   Â   Â   1 . 3 % Â   Â   168 Â   Â   Â   1 . 7 % Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   income before taxes Â   Â   629 Â   Â   Â   8 . 8 % Â   Â   2 , 171 Â   Â   Â   22 . 4 % provision for taxes Â   Â   Â — Â   Â   Â   Â — % Â   Â   728 Â   Â   Â   7 . 5 % Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   net income Â   $ 629 Â   Â   Â   8 . 8 % Â   $ 1 , 443 Â   Â   Â   14 . 9 % Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   diluted earnings per share Â   $ 0 . 11 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   $ 0 . 25 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   the following table sets forth information of geographic regions for the periods indicated : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   q12009 Â   Â   q12008 Â   ( dollars in millions ) Â   revenue Â   Â   % of total Â   Â   revenue Â   Â   % of total Â   asia-pacific Â   $ 3 , 647 Â   Â   Â   51 % Â   $ 4 , 788 Â   Â   Â   50 % americas Â   Â   1 , 510 Â   Â   Â   21 % Â   Â   2 , 016 Â   Â   Â   21 % europe1 Â   Â   1 , 273 Â   Â   Â   18 % Â   Â   1 , 863 Â   Â   Â   19 % japan Â   Â   715 Â   Â   Â   10 % Â   Â   1 , 006 Â   Â   Â   10 % Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   total Â   $ 7 , 145 Â   Â   Â   100 % Â   $ 9 , 673 Â   Â   Â   100 % Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   1 Â   region includes europe , the middle east , and africa . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) our net revenue for q1 2009 was $ 7 . 1 Â   billion , a decrease of 26 % compared to q1 2008 . the decrease was primarily due to lower unit sales of microprocessors and chipsets . revenue from the sale of nor flash memory products and communications products declined approximately $ 400 Â   million , primarily as a result of the divestiture of these businesses . revenue in all four geographic regions declined significantly . our overall gross margin dollars for q1 2009 were $ 3 . 2 Â   billion , a decrease of $ 2 . 0 Â   billion , or 38 % , compared to q1 2008 . our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 45 . 3 % in q1 2009 , from 53 . 8 % in q1 2008 . the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage decrease in the digital enterprise group and mobility group operating segments . this was partially offset by the positive impact on gross margin due to the divestiture of our nor flash memory business . we derived substantially all of our overall gross margin dollars and operating profit in q1 2009 and q1 2008 from the sales of microprocessors in the digital enterprise group and mobility group operating segments . see Â “ business outlook Â ” for a discussion of gross margin expectations . digital enterprise groupthe revenue and operating income for the digital enterprise group ( deg ) Â   operating segment for q1 2009 and q1 2008 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   q12009 Â   Â   q12008 Â   microprocessor revenue Â   $ 3 , 258 Â   Â   $ 4 , 236 Â   chipset , motherboard , and other revenue Â   Â   751 Â   Â   Â   1 , 205 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   net revenue Â   $ 4 , 009 Â   Â   $ 5 , 441 Â   operating income Â   $ 703 Â   Â   $ 1 , 763 Â   net revenue for the deg operating segment decreased by $ 1 . 4 Â   billion , or 26 % , in q1 2009 compared to q1 2008 . microprocessors within deg include microprocessors designed for the desktop and enterprise computing market segments as well as embedded microprocessors . the decrease in microprocessor revenue was primarily due to lower enterprise and desktop unit sales . higher enterprise average selling prices were partially offset by lower desktop average selling prices . the decrease in chipset , motherboard , and other revenue was primarily due to lower chipset and motherboard unit sales and lower revenue from the sale of communications products . operating income decreased by $ 1 . 1 Â   billion , or 60 % , in q1 2009 compared to q1 2008 . the decrease in operating income was primarily due to the lower revenue . in addition , during the first quarter of 2009 we recorded approximately $ 250 Â   million of factory underutilization charges , primarily relating to chipsets and microprocessors . this was partially offset by lower microprocessor unit costs . mobility groupthe revenue and operating income for the mobility group ( mg ) Â   operating segment for q1 2009 and q1 2008 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   q12009 Â   Â   q12008 Â   microprocessor revenue Â   $ 2 , 188 Â   Â   $ 2 , 726 Â   chipset and other revenue Â   Â   726 Â   Â   Â   943 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   net revenue Â   $ 2 , 914 Â   Â   $ 3 , 669 Â   operating income Â   $ 244 Â   Â   $ 1 , 166 Â   net revenue for the mg operating segment decreased by $ 755 Â   million , or 21 % , in q1 2009 compared to q1 2008 . the decrease in microprocessor revenue was due to lower microprocessor average selling prices and lower microprocessor unit sales . the lower average selling prices were due to the increase in unit sales of intel atom processors . the decrease in chipset and other revenue was primarily due to lower revenue from the sale of wireless connectivity products and lower chipset unit sales . operating income decreased by $ 922 Â   million , or 79 % , in q1 2009 compared to q1 2008 . the decrease was primarily due to lower microprocessor revenue . in addition , during the first quarter of 2009 we recorded approximately $ 420 Â   million of factory underutilization charges , primarily related to microprocessors and chipsets . this was partially offset by lower microprocessor unit costs .

which 100 employees have left the company as of march Â   28 , 2009 . most of these employee actions occurred within manufacturing . the remaining accrual as of march Â   28 , 2009 was related to severance benefits that are recorded within accrued compensation and benefits . we estimate that these employee severance and benefit charges will result in gross annual savings of approximately $ 240

determined the impairment charges using the revised fair value of the equity and note receivable that we received upon completion of the divestiture , less selling costs . the lower fair value was primarily a result of a decline in the outlook for the flash memory market segment . we had previously incurred $ 85 Â   million in asset impairment charges in 2007 related to assets that we sold in

q1 2009 reduced our effective tax rate by 23 . 7 % compared to the impact of discrete items of q1 2008 , primarily due to the q1 2009 settlement of various federal and state matters related to prior years . business outlookour future results of operations and the topics of other forward-looking statements contained in this form 10-q , including this md & a , involve a number of risks and uncertainties Â — in particular : Â   Â • Â   current economic uncertainty , including the tightening of credit markets , as well as future economic conditions ; Â   Â • Â   our goals and strategies ; Â   Â • Â   new product introductions ; Â   Â • Â   plans to cultivate new businesses ; Â   Â • Â   divestitures or investments ; Â   Â • Â   revenue and pricing ; Â   Â • Â   gross margin and costs ;

Â   capital spending ; Â   Â • Â   depreciation ; Â   Â • Â   potential impairment of investments ; Â   Â • Â   our effective tax rate ; and Â   Â • Â   pending legal proceedings . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) the current uncertainty in global economic conditions makes it particularly difficult to predict product demand and other related matters and makes it more likely that our actual results could differ materially from our expectations . in addition to the various important factors discussed above , a number of other important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations . see the risks described in Â “ risk factors Â ” in part Â   ii , item Â   1a of this form 10-q . in our april Â   14 , 2009 earnings release we stated that we were not providing a revenue forecast as part of our business outlook , but we indicated at that time that for our internal purposes , we were planning for revenue to be approximately flat to the first quarter . our revenue plan is a statement made as of april Â   14 , 2009 , is not a part of business outlook , and is not subject to updating by the company in the period prior to the Â “ quiet period . Â ” our expectations for the remainder of 2009 are as follows : Â   q2 2009 Â   Â • Â   gross margin percentage : Â   Â • Â   depreciation : Â   Â • Â   total spending ( research and development plus marketing , general and administrative expenses ) : Â   Â • Â   restructuring and asset impairment charges : Â   Â • Â   net gains ( losses ) Â   from equity investments and interest and other : Â   full year 2009 Â   Â • Â   capital spending : Â   Â • Â   depreciation : Â   Â • Â   total spending ( research and development plus marketing , general and administrative expenses ) : Â   Â • Â   tax rate : status of business outlookwe expect that our corporate representatives will , from time to time , meet privately with investors , investment analysts , the media , and others , and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the Â “ business outlook Â ” section and elsewhere in this form 10-q , including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this form 10-q . at the same time , we will keep this form 10-q and our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site at www . intc . comfrom the close of business on may Â   29 , 2009 until our quarterly earnings release is published , presently scheduled for july Â   14 , 2009 , we will observe a Â “ quiet period . Â ” during the quiet period , the Â “ business outlook Â ” and other forward-looking statements first published in our form 8-k filed on april Â   14 , 2009 , as reiterated or updated as applicable , in this form 10-q , should be considered historical , speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update . during the quiet period , our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or our financial results or expectations . the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period , and any others that we utilize from time to time , may vary at our discretion . liquidity and capital resourcescash , short-term investments , debt instruments included in trading assets , and debt at the end of each period were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   march 28 , Â   Â   dec . 27 , Â   ( dollars in millions ) Â   2009 Â   Â   2008 Â   cash , short-term investments , and debt instruments included in trading assets Â   $ 10 , 313 Â   Â   $ 11 ,

condition and results of operations ( continued ) in summary , our cash flows were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   three months ended Â   Â   Â   march 28 , Â   Â   march 29 , Â   ( in millions ) Â   2009 Â   Â   2008 Â   net cash provided by operating activities Â   $ 378 Â   Â   $ 2 , 215 Â   net cash provided by ( used for ) investing activities Â   Â   409 Â   Â   Â   ( 921 ) net cash used for financing activities Â   Â   ( 601 ) Â   Â   ( 2 , 718 ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   net increase ( decrease ) Â   in cash and cash equivalents Â   $ 186 Â   Â   $ ( 1 , 424 ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   operating activitiescash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities . cash from operations for the first quarter of 2009 was $ 378 million , a decrease of $ 1 . 8 Â   billion compared to the first quarter of 2008 , primarily due to lower net income and changes in our working capital such as lower accounts payable and lower income taxes payable , partially offset by lower inventories . inventories as of march Â   28 , 2009 decreased compared to december Â   27 , 2008 , due to lower microprocessor , chipset , and raw material inventories . accounts payable as of march Â   28 , 2009 decreased compared to december Â   27 , 2008 on lower production spending . accrued compensation and benefits liabilities decreased compared to december Â   27 , 2008 primarily due to the payout of 2008 year-end profit dependent compensation during the first quarter of 2009 . as of march , 28 , 2009 , our other accrued liabilities included $ 264 Â   million in customer credit balances ( $ 447 Â   million as of december Â   27 , 2008 ) . accounts receivable as of march Â   28 , 2009 increased compared to december Â   27 , 2008 , despite decreased revenue , due to a higher proportion of sales occurring at the end of the first quarter of 2009 . for the first quarter of 2009 , our two largest customers accounted for 40 % of net revenue ( 38 % for the first quarter of 2008 ) with one of those customers accounting for 21 % of our net revenue , and another customer accounting for 19 % of our net revenue . these two largest customers accounted for 40 % of net accounts receivable at march Â   28 , 2009 ( 46 % at december Â   27 , 2008 ) . investing activitiesinvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures , net investment purchases , maturities , and disposals . in the first quarter of 2009 , our investing activities resulted in a net cash inflow of $ 409 million compared to a net cash outflow of $ 921 Â   million in the first quarter of 2008 . this was driven primarily by a decrease in purchases of available-for-sale debt investments which was partially offset by an increase in capital spending . financing activitiesfinancing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases and retirement of common stock , payment of dividends to stockholders , and proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans . the decrease in cash used for financing activities in the first quarter of 2009 , compared to the first quarter of 2008 , was primarily due to the absence of repurchases and retirement of common stock during the first quarter of 2009 . in the first quarter of 2008 , we repurchased 121 . 9 Â   million shares of common stock at a cost of $ 2 . 5 Â   billion . as of march Â   28 , 2009 , $ 7 . 4 Â   billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization of $ 25 Â   billion . we base our level of stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions , and this level may fluctuate . our dividend payment was $ 779 Â   million in the first quarter of 2009 , slightly higher than the $ 739 million paid in the first quarter of 2008 . proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee equity incentive plans totaled $ 247 Â   million for the first quarter of 2009 compared to $ 468 Â   million for the first quarter of 2008 , as a result of a lower volume of employee exercises of stock options . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) liquiditycash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity . as of march Â   28 , 2009 , we also had an investment portfolio valued at $ 12 . 8 Â   billion , consisting of cash and cash equivalents , debt instruments included in trading assets , and short- and long-term investments . our investment policy requires all investments with original maturities at the time of investment of up to 6 Â   months to be rated at least a-1 / p-1 by standard & poor Â ’ s / moody Â ’ s , and specifies a higher minimum rating for investments with longer maturities . for instance , investments with maturities of greater than three years require a minimum rating of aa- / aa3 at the time of investment . government regulations imposed on investment alternatives of our non-u . s . subsidiaries , or the absence of a rated counterparties in certain countries , result in some minor exceptions . substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with a / a2 or better rated issuers , and the majority of the issuers are rated aa- / aa2 or better . additionally , we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterparty Â ’ s relative credit standing . as of march 28 , 2009 , the total credit exposure to any single counterparty did not exceed $ 500 Â   million . credit rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments . the amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the amounts , if any , by which a counterparty Â ’ s obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty , because we enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions subject to international swaps and derivatives association , inc . ( isda ) Â   agreements . the credit quality of our investment portfolio remains high during this difficult credit environment , with other-than-temporary impairments on our available-for-sale debt instruments limited to $ 7 Â   million in the first quarter of 2009 and $ 51 Â   million cumulatively since the beginning of 2008 . in addition , we continue to be able to invest in high-quality investments . however , we have seen a reduction in the volume of available commercial paper from certain market segments . as a result , our investments in short-term government funds have increased , which has reduced our average investment return . with the exception of a limited amount of investments for which we have recognized other-than-temporary impairments , we have not seen significant liquidation delays , and for those that have matured we have received the full par value of our original debt investments . we have the intent and ability to hold our debt investments that have unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amounts invested , which may occur at or near the maturity of those investments . as of march Â   28 , 2009 , $ 8 . 8 Â   billion of our portfolio had a remaining maturity of less than one year . as of march Â   28 , 2009 , our cumulative unrealized losses , net of corresponding hedging activities , related to debt instruments classified as trading assets were approximately $ 120 Â   million ( approximately $ 145 Â   million as of december Â   27 , 2008 ) . as of march Â   28 , 2009 , our cumulative unrealized losses related to debt instruments classified as available-for-sale were approximately $ 230 Â   million ( approximately $ 215 Â   million as of december Â   27 , 2008 ) . substantially all of our unrealized losses can be attributed to fair value fluctuations in an unstable credit environment that resulted in a decrease in the market liquidity for debt instruments . we continually monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and mitigate our credit and interest rate exposures in accordance with the policies approved by our board of directors . we intend to continue to closely monitor future developments in the credit markets and make appropriate changes to our investment policy as deemed necessary . based on our ability to liquidate our investment portfolio and our expected operating cash flows , we do not anticipate any liquidity constraints as a result of either the current credit environment or potential investment fair value fluctuations . our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity . we have an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $ 3 . 0 Â   billion , including through the issuance of commercial paper . maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during the first quarter of 2009 were approximately $ 610 Â   million , although no commercial paper remained outstanding as of march Â   28 , 2009 . our commercial paper was rated a-1 + by standard & poor Â ’ s and p-1 by moody Â ’ s as of march Â   28 , 2009 . despite the tightening of the credit markets , we continue to be able to access funds through the credit markets , including through the issuance of commercial paper . we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt , equity , and other securities . we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 Â   months , including capital expenditures for manufacturing and assembly and test , working capital requirements , and potential dividends , common stock repurchases , and acquisitions or strategic investments . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) fair value of financial instrumentsthe assessment of fair value for our financial instruments is based on the provisions of sfas no . 157 . sfas no . Â   157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value . observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party , whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability . a financial instrument Â ’ s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement . credit risk is factored into the valuation of financial instruments that we measure and record at fair value on a recurring basis . when fair value is determined using observable market prices , the credit risk is incorporated into the market price of the financial instrument . when fair value is determined using pricing models , such as a discounted cash flow model , the issuer Â ’ s credit risk and / or intel Â ’ s credit risk is factored into the calculation of the fair value , as appropriate . during the first quarter of 2009 , the valuation of our liabilities measured and recorded at fair value as well as our derivative instruments in a current or potential net liability position were not impacted by changes in our credit risk . the credit ratings of certain counterparties have deteriorated . however , the deterioration of these credit ratings did not have a significant impact on the valuation of either our marketable debt instruments or derivative instruments in a current or potential net asset position . when values are determined using inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the values of the instruments being measured , we classify those instruments as level 3 under the sfas no . Â   157 hierarchy . as of march Â   28 , 2009 , our financial instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 13 . 4 Â   billion of assets , of which $ 1 . 2 Â   billion ( 9 % ) were classified as level 3 . in addition , our financial instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 382 Â   million of liabilities , of which $ 165 Â   million ( 43 % ) were classified as level 3 . during the first quarter of 2009 , we transferred approximately $ 260 Â   million of assets from level 3 to level 2 . these assets primarily consisted of floating-rate notes that were transferred from level 3 to level 2 due to a greater availability of observable market data and / or non-binding market consensus prices to value or corroborate the value of our instruments . during the first quarter of 2009 , we recognized an insignificant amount of losses on the assets that were transferred from level 3 to level 2 . during the first quarter of 2009 , the level 3 assets and liabilities that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis experienced net unrealized fair value gains totaling $ 15 million . of this amount , gains of $ 36 Â   million were recognized in our consolidated condensed statements of income and losses of $ 21 Â   million were included in other comprehensive income . we believe the losses included in other comprehensive income represent a temporary decline in the fair value of available-for-sale investments . during the first quarter of 2009 , we did not experience any significant realized gains ( losses ) Â   related to the level 3 assets or liabilities in our portfolio . marketable debt instrumentsas of march Â   28 , 2009 , our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 12 . 6 Â   billion of marketable debt instruments . of these instruments , approximately $ 1 . 0 Â   billion was classified as level 1 , approximately $ 10 . 4 Â   billion as level 2 , and approximately $ 1 . 2 Â   billion as level 3 . when available , we use observable market prices for identical securities to value our marketable debt instruments . if observable market prices are not available , we use non-binding market consensus prices that we seek to corroborate with observable market data , if available , or non-observable market data . when prices from multiple sources are available for a given instrument , we use observable market quotes to price our instruments , in lieu of prices from other sources . our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 was classified as such due to the usage of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets . marketable debt instruments in this category generally include certain of our floating-rate notes , corporate bonds , and money market fund deposits . management judgment was required to determine our policy that defines the levels at which sufficient volume and frequency of transactions are met for a market to be considered active . our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one-month period prior to the valuation date of each individual instrument , including the number of days each individual instrument trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding amount of the issued instrument . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) approximately 10 % of our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2 was classified as such due to the usage of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in less active markets . when observable market prices for identical securities are not available , we price our marketable debt instruments using : non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data ; quoted market prices for similar instruments ; or pricing models , such as a discounted cash flow model , with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data . non-binding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers . these valuation models incorporate a number of inputs , including non-binding and binding broker quotes ; observable market prices for identical and / or similar securities ; and the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs and to a lesser degree non-observable market inputs . we corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices with observable market data using statistical models when observable market data exist . the discounted cash flow model uses observable market inputs , such as libor-based yield curves , currency spot and forward rates , and credit ratings . approximately 50 % of our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2 was classified as such due to the usage of non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data and approximately 40 % due to the usage of a discounted cash flow model . marketable debt instruments classified as level 2 generally include commercial paper , bank time deposits , municipal bonds , certain of our money market fund deposits and corporate bonds , and a majority of floating-rate notes . our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes . when observable market data is not available , we corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes using unobservable data , if available . marketable debt instruments in this category generally include asset-backed securities and certain of our floating-rate notes and corporate bonds . all of our investments in asset-backed securities were classified as level 3 , and substantially all of them were valued using non-binding market consensus prices that we were not able to corroborate with observable market data due to the lack of transparency in the market for asset-backed securities . equity securitiesas of march Â   28 , 2009 , our portfolio of assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 412 Â   million of marketable equity securities . of these securities , $ 392 Â   million was classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets . our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one-month period prior to the valuation date for each individual security , including the number of days each individual equity security trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding shares of that security . the fair values of our investments in clearwire corporation ( $ 183 Â   million ) and vmware , inc . ( $ 130 Â   million ) constituted the substantial majority of the fair values of the marketable equity securities that we classified as level 1 . the remaining marketable equity securities ( $ 20 Â   million ) were classified as level 2 because their valuations were either based on quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets or adjusted for security-specific restrictions . as of march Â   28 , 2009 , our portfolio of assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 286 Â   million of equity securities offsetting deferred compensation . all of these securities were classified as level 1 , because their valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets .

Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) gross margin as a percentage of revenue was higher in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the first quarter of 2008 as a result of chipset write-offs taken in the first quarter , and the divestiture of our nor flash memory business in the second quarter , partially offset by the effects of lower microprocessor average selling prices . we expect gross margin as percentage of revenue to increase again in the third quarter due to higher microprocessor volume and unit cost declines as we continue to gain efficiencies in the manufacturing of microprocessors on our 45nm process technology . in the second quarter of 2008 , we recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of $ 96 million . we expect charges as a result of our restructuring program announced in 2006 to decline in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year . divestitures and other headcount reductions have resulted in our headcount being reduced by 20 , 000 employees since the second quarter of 2006 . efficiency efforts have contributed to faster factory throughput , higher yields , and improved equipment utilization . from a financial condition perspective , we ended the second quarter of 2008 with an investment portfolio valued at $ 16 . 2 Â   billion , consisting of cash and cash equivalents , fixed-income trading assets , and short- and long-term investments . substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with a / a2 or better rated issuers , and the majority of the issuers are rated aa- / aa2 or better . see Â “ liquidity and capital resources Â ” for additional details on our investment portfolio . during the first half of 2008 , we repurchased $ 5 . 0 Â   billion of stock through our stock repurchase program and paid $ 1 . 5 Â   billion to stockholders as dividends . strategyour goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide digital economy . as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment , we use our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits , as well as our financial resources , global presence , and brand recognition . we believe that we have the scale , capacity , and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to customers Â ’ needs quickly . some of our key focus areas are listed below : Â   Â • Â   customer orientation . Â   Â • Â   energy-efficient performance . Â   Â • Â   design and manufacturing technology leadership . Â   Â • Â   strategic investments . Â   Â • Â   business environment and software Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) we believe that the proliferation of the internet , including user demand for premium content and rich media , is the primary driver of the need for greater performance in pcs and servers . a growing number of older pcs are increasingly incapable of handling the tasks that users are demanding , such as streaming video , uploading photos , and online gaming . as these tasks become even more demanding and require more computing power , we believe that users will need and want to buy new pcs to perform everyday tasks on the internet . we also believe that increased internet traffic is creating a need for greater server infrastructure , including server products optimized for energy-efficient performance . the trend of mobile microprocessor unit growth outpacing the growth in desktop microprocessor units has accelerated and , while we previously believed a crossover would occur in 2009 , shipments of our mobile microprocessors exceeded our desktop microprocessors for the first time in the second quarter of 2008 . we believe that the demand for mobile microprocessors will result in the increased development of products with form factors and uses that require low-power microprocessors . with our research and development ( r & d ) expenditures , we are investing in areas in which we believe the application of highly integrated intel Â ® strategy by operating segmentwe completed a reorganization in the second quarter of 2008 that transferred the revenue and costs associated with a portion of the digital home group Â ’ s consumer pc components business to the digital enterprise group . the digital home group now focuses on the consumer electronics components business . the strategy by operating segment presented below is based on the new organizational structure . our digital enterprise group the strategy for our mobility group the strategy for our nand products group the flash memory group Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) the strategy for our digital home group the strategy for our digital health group the strategy for our software and solutions group critical accounting estimatesthe methods , estimates , and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our financial statements . some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments , often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain . our most critical accounting estimates include : Â   Â • Â   the valuation of non-marketable equity investments , which impacts net gains ( losses ) Â   on equity investments when we record impairments ; Â   Â • Â   the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets , which primarily impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation ; Â   Â • Â   the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes ( including the measurement of uncertain tax positions ) , which impact our provision for taxes ; Â   Â • Â   the valuation of inventory , which impacts gross margin ; and Â   Â • Â   the valuation and recognition of share-based compensation , which impact gross margin ; r & d expenses ; and marketing , general and administrative expenses . below , we discuss these policies further , as well as the estimates and judgments involved . we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies , such as those for revenue recognition , including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors ; however , these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective . non-marketable equity investmentswe regularly invest in the non-marketable equity instruments of private companies , which range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models . the carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio , excluding equity derivatives , totaled $ 4 . 5 Â   billion as of june Â   28 , 2008 ( $ 3 . 4 Â   billion as of december Â   29 , 2007 ) . the majority of the balance as of june Â   28 , 2008 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment , including our investments in im flash technologies , llc ( imft ) Â   of $ 2 . 1 Â   billion ( $ 2 . 2 Â   billion as of december Â   29 , 2007 ) , our investment in im flash singapore , llp ( imfs ) Â   of $ 346 Â   million ( $ 146 Â   million as of december Â   29 , 2007 ) , and our investment in numonyx of $ 821 Â   million ( see Â “ note 16 : equity investments Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q ) . our non-marketable equity investments are classified in other long-term assets on the consolidated condensed balance sheets . non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky , and a number of these companies are likely to fail . their success is dependent on product development , market acceptance , operational efficiency , and other factors . in addition , depending on their future prospects and on market conditions , they may not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations , with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings , and our investments would likely become impaired . we review our investments quarterly for indicators of impairment ; however , for non-marketable equity investments , the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would significantly harm the fair value of the investment . the indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances include : Â   Â • Â   the investee Â ’ s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects ; Â   Â • Â   the technological feasibility of the investee Â ’ s products and technologies ; Â   Â • Â   the general market conditions in the investee Â ’ s industry or geographic area , including adverse regulatory or economic changes ; Â   Â • Â   factors related to the investee Â ’ s ability to remain in business , such as the investee Â ’ s liquidity , debt ratios , and the rate at which the investee is using its cash ; and Â   Â • Â   the investee Â ’ s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) investments that we identify as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired , in which case we write down the investment to its estimated fair value . we measure fair value using financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies , or a discounted cash flow technique . beginning in the first quarter of 2008 , the assessment of fair value for non-marketable cost method investments is based on the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards ( sfas ) Â   no . Â   157 , Â “ fair value measurements Â ” ( sfas no . Â   157 ) . non-marketable cost method investments that are considered impaired are classified as level 3 instruments ( see Â “ note 3 : fair value Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q ) , as they use unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement and require management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices , inherent lack of liquidity , and the long-term nature of such investments . the valuation of our non-marketable cost method investments also takes into account movements of the equity and venture capital markets , recent financing activities by the investees , changes in the interest rate environment , the investee Â ’ s capital structure , liquidation preferences for the investee Â ’ s capital , and other economic variables . see Â “ note 3 : fair value Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q for further discussion on the adoption of sfas no . Â   157 . approximately $ 12 Â   million of our non-marketable equity investments as of june Â   28 , 2008 were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis due to the recording of other-than-temporary impairment charges . other-than-temporary impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $ 11 million in the second quarter of 2008 ( $ 44 Â   million in the first half of 2008 ) . impairments recognized in the first half of 2008 represented a substantial majority of the carrying value of the impaired non-marketable equity investments . over the past 12 quarters , including the second quarter of 2008 , impairments of non-marketable equity investments have averaged $ 25 Â   million per quarter ( ranging from $ 10 Â   million to $ 44 Â   million per quarter ) . long-lived assetswe assess the impairment of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable . factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations , significant negative industry or economic trends , and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets . recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows . if an asset grouping Â ’ s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows , the asset grouping is considered to be impaired . the impairment is measured by comparing the difference between the asset grouping Â ’ s carrying amount and its fair value , based on the best information available , including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis . impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows . due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity , we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings . in addition , as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions , we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets , primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements . when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated , we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets Â ’ new , shorter useful lives . over the past 12 quarters , including the second quarter of 2008 , impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets have ranged between $ 1 Â   million and $ 320 Â   million per quarter . the restructuring related asset impairments have ranged between zero and $ 317 Â   million per quarter since the program began in the third quarter of 2006 . over the past 12 quarters , other asset impairments have ranged between $ 1 Â   million and $ 26 Â   million per quarter . long-lived assets such as goodwill , intangible assets , and property , plant , and equipment , are considered non-financial assets , and are only measured at fair value when indicators of impairment exist . the accounting and disclosure provisions of sfas no . Â   157 will not be effective for these assets until the first quarter of 2009 . see Â “ note 2 : recent accounting pronouncements and accounting changes Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q for further discussion . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) income taxeswe must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes . these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits , benefits , and deductions , and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities , which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes , as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions . significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period . we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets . if recovery is not likely , we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable . we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated condensed balance sheets . however , should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets , our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely . the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations . in accordance with financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) interpretation no . Â   48 , Â “ accounting for uncertainty in income taxes-an interpretation of sfas no . 109 Â ” ( fin 48 ) , and related guidance , we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process . the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit , including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes , if any . the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 % likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement . it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts , as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes . we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis . this evaluation is based on factors including , but not limited to , changes in facts or circumstances , changes in tax law , effectively settled issues under audit , and new audit activity . such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision . inventorythe valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality . the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products . the demand forecast is included in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions . product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base , the stage of the product life cycle of our products , consumer confidence , and customer acceptance of our products , as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost . if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly , or if we fail to forecast the demand accurately , we could be required to write off inventory , which would negatively impact our gross margin . share-based compensationtotal share-based compensation was $ 243 Â   million during the second quarter of 2008 and $ 462 Â   million for the first half of 2008 ( $ 237 Â   million in the second quarter of 2007 and $ 521 Â   million in the first half of 2007 ) . determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock purchase plans at the date of grant require judgment . we use the black-scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of these share-based awards consistent with the provisions of sfas no . Â   123 ( revised 2004 ) , Â “ share-based payment Â ” ( sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) ) . option pricing models , including the black-scholes model , also require the use of input assumptions , including expected volatility , expected life , expected dividend rate , and expected risk-free rate of return . the assumptions for expected volatility and expected life are the two assumptions that significantly affect the grant date fair value . changes in the expected dividend rate and expected risk-free rate of return do not significantly impact the calculation of fair value , and determining these inputs is not highly subjective . we use implied volatility based on freely traded options in the open market , as we believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility . in determining the appropriateness of implied volatility , we considered the following : Â   Â • Â   the volume of market activity of freely traded options , and determined that there was sufficient market activity ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the ability to reasonably match the input variables of freely traded options to those of options granted by the company , such as the date of grant and the exercise price , and determined that the input assumptions were comparable ; and Â   Â   Â • Â   the term of freely traded options used to derive implied volatility , which is generally one to two years , and determined that the length of term was sufficient . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) due to significant differences in the vesting terms and contractual life of current option grants compared to the majority of our historical grants , management does not believe that our historical share option exercise data provides us with sufficient evidence to estimate expected life . therefore , we use the simplified method of calculating expected life described in the sec Â ’ s staff accounting bulletin 107 ( sab 107 ) , as amended by staff accounting bulletin 110 ( sab 110 ) . we will continue to use the simplified method until we have the historical data necessary to provide a reasonable estimate of expected life , in accordance with sab 107 , as amended by sab 110 . higher volatility and longer expected lives result in an increase to share-based compensation determined at the date of grant . the effect that changes in the volatility and the expected life would have on the weighted average fair value of option awards and the increase in total fair value is as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   q22008 Â   Â   first half 2008 Â   Â   Â   weighted Â   Â   increase in total Â   Â   weighted Â   Â   increase in total Â   Â   Â   average Â   Â   fair value1 Â   Â   average Â   Â   fair value1 Â   Â   Â   fair value Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   Â   fair value Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   as reported Â   $ 5 . 76 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   $ 5 . 82 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   hypothetical : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   increase expected volatility by 5 Â   percentage points2 Â   $ 6 . 55 Â   Â   $ 15 Â   Â   $ 6 . 63 Â   Â   $ 16 Â   increase expected lives by 1 Â   year Â   $ 6 . 16 Â   Â   $ 8 Â   Â   $ 6 . 23 Â   Â   $ 8 Â   Â   1 Â   amounts represent the hypothetical increase in the total fair value determined at the date of grant , which would be amortized over the service period , net of estimated forfeitures . Â   2 Â   for example , an increase from 34 % reported volatility for q2 2008 to a hypothetical 39 % volatility . since the adoption of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) , reported volatility has ranged from 25 % to 38 % . in addition , sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share-based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover . quarterly adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on reported share-based compensation , as we recognize the cumulative effect of the rate adjustments for all expense amortization after january Â   1 , 2006 in the period the estimated forfeiture rates are adjusted . we estimate and adjust forfeiture rates based on a quarterly review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover . if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate , we make an adjustment that will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements . if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate , we make an adjustment that will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements . these adjustments affect our gross margin ; r & d expenses ; and marketing , general and administrative expenses . the effect of forfeiture adjustments in the second quarter and the first half of 2008 was not significant . we record cumulative adjustments to the extent that the related expense is recognized in the financial statements , beginning with implementation of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) in the first quarter of 2006 . adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates could also cause changes in the amount of expense that we recognize in future periods .

net revenue of $ 19 . 1 Â   billion in the first half of 2008 increased 9 % compared to the first half of 2007 . the increase was primarily due to significantly higher microprocessor unit sales , which were partially offset by lower microprocessor average selling prices . higher chipset unit sales were partially offset by lower unit sales of motherboards and lower revenue from the sale of cellular baseband products . lower nor flash memory revenue was partially offset by higher nand flash memory revenue in the first half of 2008 . the lower nor flash memory revenue was primarily a result of the divestiture of the nor flash memory business , while the higher nand flash memory revenue was due to an increase in unit sales associated with the ramp of our nand flash memory business . revenue in all four regions increased in the first half of 2008 compared to the first half of 2007 . revenue in the americas and europe regions increased 13 % and 12 % respectively , while revenue in the asia-pacific region increased 8 % and revenue in the japan region increased 3 % compared to the first half of 2007 . a substantial majority of the revenue growth in mature markets in the first half of 2008 compared to the first half of 2007 occurred in the asia-pacific and americas regions . revenues in emerging markets increased in the first half of 2008 compared to the first half of 2007 , with substantially all of the growth occurring in the europe and americas regions . our overall gross margin dollars for the first half of 2008 were $ 10 . 5 Â   billion , an increase of $ 1 . 9 billion , or 23 % , compared to q2 2007 . our overall gross margin percentage increased to 54 . 6 % in the first half of 2008 , from 48 . 5 % in the first half of 2007 . the increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to gross margin increases in the digital enterprise group operating segment , partially offset by the gross margin percentage decline in the mobility group operating segment . we derived most of our overall gross margin dollars and operating profit in the first half of 2008 and substantially all of our overall gross margin dollars and operating profit in the first half of 2007 from the sale of microprocessors in the digital enterprise group and mobility group operating segments . see Â “ business outlook Â ” later in this section for a discussion of gross margin expectations . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) digital enterprise groupthe revenue and operating income for the digital enterprise group operating segment for the first half of 2008 and the first half of 2007 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   ytd 2008 Â   Â   ytd 2007 Â   microprocessor revenue Â   $ 8 , 344 Â   Â   $ 7 , 350 Â   chipset , motherboard , and other revenue Â   Â   2 , 470 Â   Â   Â   2 , 481 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   net revenue Â   $ 10 , 814 Â   Â   $ 9 , 831 Â   operating income Â   $ 3 , 473 Â   Â   $ 1 , 735 Â   net revenue for the digital enterprise group operating segment increased by $ 983 Â   million , or 10 % , in the first half of 2008 compared to the first half of 2007 . the increase in microprocessor revenue was due to higher enterprise microprocessor unit sales , and to a lesser extent , higher desktop unit sales and average selling prices . a higher mix of enterprise microprocessor unit sales also had a positive impact on total average selling prices within the deg operating segment . chipset , motherboard , and other revenue was approximately flat , with lower unit sales of motherboards and lower chipset average selling prices offset by higher chipset unit sales . operating income increased by $ 1 . 7 Â   billion , or 100 % , in the first half of 2008 compared to the first half of 2007 . the increase in operating income was primarily due to higher microprocessor revenue and approximately $ 330 Â   million of lower start-up costs , primarily related to our 45nm process technology . lower unit cost for microprocessors and chipsets and $ 180 Â   million of lower factory underutilization charges also contributed to the increase in operating income . these increases were partially offset by sales in the first half of 2007 of desktop microprocessor inventory that had been previously written off . mobility groupthe revenue and operating income for the mobility group operating segment for the first half of 2008 and the first half of 2007 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   ytd 2008 Â   Â   ytd 2007 Â   microprocessor revenue Â   $ 5 , 468 Â   Â   $ 4 , 839 Â   chipset and other revenue Â   Â   1 , 998 Â   Â   Â   1 , 764 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   net revenue Â   $ 7 , 466 Â   Â   $ 6 , 603 Â   operating income Â   $ 2 , 417 Â   Â   $ 2 , 634 Â   net revenue for the mobility group operating segment increased by $ 863 Â   million , or 13 % , in the first half of 2008 compared to the first half of 2007 . the increase in microprocessor revenue was due to significantly higher unit sales , partially offset by significantly lower average selling prices . the increase in chipset and other revenue was due to higher chipset unit sales , partially offset by lower revenue from the sale of cellular baseband products . we are winding down the sales from the manufacturing agreement entered into as part of the divestiture of the cellular baseband products business . operating income decreased by $ 217 Â   million , or 8 % , in the first half of 2008 compared to the first half of 2007 . higher operating expenses related to advertising and process development were partially offset by higher microprocessor and chipset revenue . lower microprocessor unit costs were partially offset by higher chipset unit costs due to the ramp of new chipset products and sales in the first half of 2007 of chipset inventory that had been previously been written off . the effects of the wind-down of the cellular baseband products business also contributed to the decrease in operating income . operating expensesoperating expenses for the first half of 2008 and the first half of 2007 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   ytd 2008 Â   Â   ytd 2007 Â   research and development Â   $ 2 , 935 Â   Â   $ 2 , 753 Â   marketing , general and administrative Â   $ 2 , 779 Â   Â   $ 2 , 572 Â   restructuring and asset impairment charges Â   $ 425 Â   Â   $ 157 Â   research and development .

Â   159 , Â “ the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities Â — including an amendment of fasb statement no . Â   115 Â ” ( sfas no . Â   159 ) . there was a smaller reduction in income taxes payable due to significant tax settlements with the irs in the first half of 2007 , partially offset by higher tax payments in the first half of 2008 . accounts receivable were lower compared to december Â   29 , 2007 , due to lower revenue in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 . for the first half of 2008 , our two largest customers accounted for 38 % of net revenue ( 34 % for the first half of 2007 ) , with each of these customers accounting for 19 % of revenue . these two largest customers accounted for 48 % of net accounts receivable at june Â   28 , 2008 ( 35 % at december Â   29 , 2007 ) . investing activitiesinvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures and net investment purchases , maturities , and disposals , and purchases of debt securities , as well as investments in non-marketable and other equity investments . the decrease in cash used in investing activities in the first half of 2008 , compared to the first half of 2007 , was primarily due to an increase in maturities and a decrease in purchases of available-for-sale debt investments . lower capital spending and lower investments in non-marketable equity investments ( primarily related to our investments in imft ) decreased the cash used for investing activities . due to the adoption of sfas no . Â   159 , purchases and maturities for marketable debt instruments classified as trading assets are included in investing activity for the first half of 2008 , which caused an increase in cash outflows from investing activities in the first half of 2008 compared to the first half of 2007 , as the related cash outflows were previously included as operating activities . financing activitiesfinancing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases and retirement of common stock , payment of dividends to stockholders , and proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans . the higher cash used in financing activities in the first half of 2008 , compared to the first half of 2007 , was primarily due to an increase in repurchases and retirement of common stock . for the first half of 2008 , we repurchased $ 5 . 1 Â   billion of common stock , including the repurchase of 230 . 7 Â   million shares of common stock as part of our common stock repurchase program at a cost of $ 5 . 0 Â   billion . for the first half of 2007 , we repurchased $ 537 Â   million of common stock , including the repurchase of 23 . 8 Â   million shares of common stock as part of our common stock repurchase program at a cost of $ 500 Â   million . as of june Â   28 , 2008 , $ 9 . 5 Â   billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization of $ 25 Â   billion . we base our level of stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions , and this level may fluctuate . our dividend payment was $ 1 . 5 Â   billion in the first half of 2008 , higher than the $ 1 . 3 Â   billion paid in the same period of the prior year , due to increases in quarterly cash dividends per common share . for the first half of 2008 , proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee equity incentive plans were $ 828 Â   million compared to $ 1 . 4 Â   billion during the first half of 2007 as a result of a lower volume of employee exercises of stock options . liquiditycash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity . as of june Â   28 , 2008 , we also had an investment portfolio valued at $ 16 . 2 Â   billion , consisting of cash and cash equivalents , fixed-income trading assets , and short- and long-term investments . substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with a / a2 or better rated issuers , and the majority of the issuers are rated aa- / aa2 or better . as of june Â   28 , 2008 , $ 10 . 0 Â   billion of our portfolio had a remaining maturity of less than one year . during the first half of 2008 , we did not recognize significant other-than-temporary impairments on our available-for-sale debt instruments . as of june 28 , 2008 , our cumulative unrealized losses , net of corresponding hedging activities , related to debt instruments classified as trading assets was $ 33 Â   million ( $ 23 Â   million as of december Â   29 , 2007 ) . as of june Â   28 , 2008 , our cumulative unrealized losses , net of corresponding hedging activities , related to debt instruments classified as available-for-sale was $ 53 Â   million ( $ 54 million as of december Â   29 , 2007 ) . these unrealized losses were insignificant in relation to our total available-for-sale portfolio . substantially all of our unrealized losses can be attributed to fair value fluctuations in an unstable credit environment . our portfolio includes $ 1 . 6 Â   billion of asset-backed securities as of june Â   28 , 2008 . approximately one-third of these securities were collateralized by first-lien mortgages , and the remaining were collateralized by student loans , credit card debt , or auto loans . during the first half of 2008 , our asset-backed securities experienced net unrealized fair value declines totaling $ 20 Â   million , of which $ 19 Â   million was recognized in our consolidated condensed statements of income . as of june Â   28 , 2008 , most of our investments in asset-backed securities were rated aaa by moody Â ’ s and substantially all were rated aaa by standard & poor Â ’ s , and the expected weighted average remaining maturity was less than two years . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) we have the intent and ability to hold our debt investments that have unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amounts invested . we continually monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and mitigate our credit and interest rate exposures in accordance with the policies approved by our board of directors . we intend to continue to closely monitor future developments in the credit markets and make appropriate changes to our investment policy as deemed necessary . based on our ability to liquidate our investment portfolio and our expected operating cash flows , we do not anticipate any liquidity constraints as a result of either the current credit environment or potential investment fair value fluctuations . another potential source of liquidity is authorized borrowings for commercial paper , of up to $ 3 . 0 billion . there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program during the first half of 2008 . our commercial paper was rated a-1 + by standard & poor Â ’ s and p-1 by moody Â ’ s as of june Â   28 , 2008 . we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt , equity , and other securities . we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 Â   months , including capital expenditures for the expansion or upgrading of worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test capacity , working capital requirements , the dividend program , potential stock repurchases , and potential acquisitions or strategic investments . off-balance-sheet arrangementsduring the second quarter of 2008 , we guaranteed the repayment of $ 275 Â   million in principal of numonyx Â ’ s payment obligations under its senior credit facility , as well as accrued unpaid interest , expenses of the lenders and penalties . see Â “ note 16 : equity investments Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q for further discussion . contractual obligationsduring the second quarter of 2008 , clearwire and sprint nextel corporation entered into an agreement to reorganize clearwire into a new company . we have agreed to invest $ 1 . 0 Â   billion in this new company . see Â “ note 16 : equity investments Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q for further discussion . the requirement to make the $ 1 . 0 billion investment is subject to certain closing conditions . fair valuebeginning in the first quarter of 2008 , the assessment of fair value for our financial instruments is based on the provisions of sfas no . Â   157 . sfas no . Â   157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that is based on three levels of inputs and requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value . when values are determined using inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the values of the instruments being measured , we classify those instruments as level 3 under the sfas no . Â   157 hierarchy . as of june Â   28 , 2008 , our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 17 . 2 Â   billion of assets , of which $ 2 . 4 Â   billion ( 14 % ) were classified as level 3 instruments . in addition , our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 296 million of liabilities , of which $ 152 Â   million ( 51 % ) were classified as level 3 instruments . in the first half of 2008 , we transferred approximately $ 580 Â   million of assets from level 3 to level 2 . these assets primarily consisted of floating-rate notes and were transferred from level 3 to level 2 as observable market data and / or non-binding market consensus prices that can be corroborated by observable market data to value these instruments became available . during the first half of 2008 , we recognized an insignificant amount of losses on these instruments . during the first half of 2008 , the level 3 assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis experienced net unrealized fair value declines totaling $ 29 Â   million . of these declines , $ 18 Â   million were recognized in our consolidated condensed statements of income . we believe the remaining $ 11 Â   million , included in other comprehensive income , represents a temporary decline in the fair value of available-for-sale investments . we did not experience any significant realized gains ( losses ) Â   related to the level 3 assets or liabilities in our portfolio . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) as of june Â   28 , 2008 , investments in floating-rate notes and corporate bonds represented $ 7 . 9 billion ( 46 % ) of our portfolio of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis . of these instruments , $ 219 Â   million were classified as level 1 because their valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets . another $ 6 . 9 Â   billion were classified as level 2 because their valuations were based on one of the following : Â   Â • Â   observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in less active markets ; Â   Â   Â • Â   non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data ; Â   Â   Â • Â   quoted prices for similar instruments ; or Â   Â   Â • Â   pricing models , such as discounted cash flows , with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data . the remaining $ 770 Â   million of these instruments , the majority of them floating-rate notes , were classified as level 3 because their valuations were based on non-binding market consensus prices or non-binding broker quotes that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data . as of june Â   28 , 2008 , investments in commercial paper , bank time deposits , and money market fund deposits represented $ 6 . 2 Â   billion ( 36 % ) of our portfolio of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis . of these instruments , all $ 837 Â   million of the money market fund deposits were classified as level 1 . the remaining instruments were classified as level 2 because their valuations were based on pricing models with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data . as of june Â   28 , 2008 , investments in asset-backed securities represented $ 1 . 6 Â   billion ( 10 % ) of our portfolio of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis . all of these instruments were classified as level 3 , and substantially all of them were valued using non-binding market consensus prices that we were not able to corroborate by observable market data due to the lack of visibility and / or liquidity in the market for asset-backed securities . as of june Â   28 , 2008 , investments in marketable equity securities represented $ 644 Â   million ( 4 % ) of our portfolio of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis . of these instruments , $ 66 million were classified as level 1 because their valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets . the remaining $ 578 Â   million were classified as level 2 because their valuations were either based on quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets or adjusted for security specific restrictions . the fair values of two of these investments , vmware , inc . ( $ 473 Â   million ) and micron ( $ 101 Â   million ) , constituted substantially all of the fair values of the marketable equity securities that we classified as level 2 . in measuring the fair value of our investment in vmware , our valuation reflects a discount from the quoted price of vmware Â ’ s stock due to a transfer restriction . in measuring the fair value of our investment in micron , our valuation reflects a discount from the quoted market price of micron Â ’ s stock due to our investment being in a form of rights exchangeable into unregistered micron stock . as of june Â   28 , 2008 , investments in equity securities offsetting deferred compensation represented $ 443 Â   million ( 3 % ) of our portfolio of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis . all of these instruments were classified as level 1 because their valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets . business outlookour future results of operations and the topics of other forward-looking statements contained in this form 10-q , including this md & a , involve a number of risks and uncertainties Â — in particular , our goals and strategies ; new product introductions ; plans to cultivate new businesses ; pending divestitures or investments ; future economic conditions ; revenue ; pricing ; gross margin and costs ; capital spending ; depreciation ; r & d expenses ; marketing , general and administrative expenses ; potential impairment of investments ; our effective tax rate ; pending legal proceedings ; net gains ( losses ) Â   from equity investments ; and interest and other , net . we are focusing on efforts to improve operational efficiency and reduce spending that may result in several actions that could have an impact on expense levels and gross margin . in addition to the various important factors discussed above , a number of other important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations . see the risks described in Â “ risk factors Â ” in part Â   ii , item Â   1a of this form 10-q . our expectations for the third quarter of 2008 are as follows : Â   Â • Â   revenue : Â   Â   Â • Â   gross margin : Â   Â   Â • Â   depreciation : Â   Â   Â • Â   total spending : Â   Â   Â • Â   restructuring and asset impairment charges : Â   Â   Â • Â   net gains ( losses ) Â   from equity investments and interest and other : Â   Â   Â • Â   tax rate : Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) our expectations for fiscal year 2008 are as follows : Â   Â • Â   gross margin : Â   Â   Â • Â   depreciation : Â   Â   Â • Â   r & d spending : Â   Â   Â • Â   marketing , general and administrative expenses : Â   Â   Â • Â   capital spending : Â   Â   Â • Â   tax rate : status of business outlook and scheduled business updatewe expect that our corporate representatives will , from time to time , meet privately with investors , investment analysts , the media , and others , and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the Â “ business outlook Â ” section and elsewhere in this form 10-q , including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this form 10-q . at the same time , we will keep this form 10-q and our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site at www . intc . comfrom the close of business on august Â   29 , 2008 until our quarterly earnings release is published , presently scheduled for october Â   14 , 2008 , we will observe a Â “ quiet period .

Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) the trend of mobile microprocessor unit growth outpacing the growth in desktop microprocessor units has accelerated and while we previously believed a crossover would occur in 2009 , we now believe this crossover will occur within 2008 . as demand increases for mobile products , system price points expand to include new lower priced mobile microprocessors , including low power , cost-optimized processors . we expect continuing erosion in average selling prices for mobile microprocessors due to the increase in demand at these lower price points . prices for mobile microprocessors are higher than comparable desktop microprocessors ; therefore the shift in our mix to mobile microprocessors has a positive effect on our results . gross margin as a percentage of revenue was lower in the first quarter of 2008 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 as a result of lower microprocessor unit sales , chipset inventory write-offs , higher microprocessor unit costs as we transition to products using our 45-nm process technology , and higher start-up costs associated with that transition . more recently introduced products tend to have higher costs with the initial overall development and production ramp . however , our product costs are expected to decline in the second quarter and decline further in the second half of 2008 . in the fourth quarter of 2007 , we recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of $ 234 million , of which $ 85 Â   million related to our nor flash memory assets . in the first quarter of 2008 , we recorded $ 329 Â   million of restructuring and asset impairment charges , including an additional asset impairment charge of $ 275 Â   million related to the nor flash memory assets sold to numonyx subsequent to quarter close . our outlook for q2 2008 is for additional restructuring and asset impairment charges of $ 250 Â   million . we expect charges as a result of our restructuring program announced in 2006 to decline in the second half of the year . our tax rate has increased , as compared to prior periods , primarily as a result of a higher proportion of profits being generated in higher-tax jurisdictions . we expect the higher tax rate will continue until we ramp additional production in lower tax jurisdictions . from a financial condition perspective , we ended the first quarter of 2008 with an investment portfolio valued at $ 17 . 7 Â   billion , consisting of cash and cash equivalents , fixed-income trading assets , and short- and long-term investments . substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with a / a2 or better rated issuers , and the substantial majority of the issuers are rated aa- / aa2 or better . see Â “ liquidity and capital resources Â ” for additional details on our investment portfolio . during the first quarter of 2008 , we repurchased $ 2 . 5 Â   billion of stock through our stock repurchase program and paid $ 739 Â   million to stockholders as dividends . in january our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend amount by 13 % , from $ 0 . 1125 to $ 0 . 1275 per common share . in march , the board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend payout by an additional 10 % and declared a dividend of $ 0 . 14 per common share to be paid in june . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) strategyour goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide digital economy . as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment , we use our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits , as well as our financial resources , global presence , and brand recognition . we believe that we have the scale , capacity , and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to customers Â ’ needs quickly . some of our key focus areas are listed below : Â   Â • Â   customer orientation . Â   Â • Â   energy-efficient performance . Â   Â • Â   design and manufacturing technology leadership . Â   Â • Â   strategic investments . Â   Â • Â   business environment and softwarewe believe that the proliferation of the internet , including user demand for premium content and rich media , is the primary driver of the need for greater performance in pcs and servers . a growing number of older pcs are increasingly incapable of handling the tasks that users are demanding , such as streaming video , uploading photos , and online gaming . as these tasks become even more demanding and require more computing power , we believe that users will need and want to buy new pcs to perform everyday tasks on the internet . we also believe that increased internet traffic is creating a need for greater server infrastructure , including server products optimized for energy-efficient performance . the trend of mobile microprocessor unit growth outpacing the growth in desktop microprocessor units has accelerated and , while we previously believed a crossover would occur in 2009 , we now believe this crossover will occur within 2008 . we believe that the demand for mobile microprocessors will result in the increased development of products with form factors and uses that require low-power and low-cost microprocessors . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) with our research and development ( r & d ) expenditures , we are investing in areas in which we believe the application of highly integrated intel Â ® strategy by operating segmentsubsequent to the end of the first quarter , we completed a reorganization that transferred the revenue and costs associated with the digital home group Â ’ s consumer pc components business to the digital enterprise group . after the reorganization , the digital home group will focus on the consumer electronics components business . the strategy by operating segment presented below is based on the new organizational structure . our digital enterprise group the strategy for our mobility group the strategy for our nand products group beginning in the second quarter of 2008 , the flash memory group the strategy for our digital home group the strategy for our digital health group the strategy for our software and solutions group Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) critical accounting estimatesthe methods , estimates , and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our financial statements . some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments , often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain . our most critical accounting estimates include : Â   Â • Â   the valuation of non-marketable equity investments , which impacts net gains ( losses ) Â   on equity investments when we record impairments ; Â   Â • Â   the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets , which primarily impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation ; Â   Â • Â   the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes ( including the measurement of uncertain tax positions ) , which impact our provision for taxes ; Â   Â • Â   the valuation of inventory , which impacts gross margin ; and Â   Â • Â   the valuation and recognition of share-based compensation , which impact gross margin ; r & d expenses ; and marketing , general and administrative expenses . below , we discuss these policies further , as well as the estimates and judgments involved . we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies , such as those for revenue recognition , including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors ; however , these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective . non-marketable equity investmentswe regularly invest in the non-marketable equity instruments of private companies , which range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models . the carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio , excluding equity derivatives , totaled $ 3 . 6 Â   billion as of march Â   29 , 2008 ( $ 3 . 4 Â   billion as of december Â   29 , 2007 ) and included our investment in im flash technologies , llc ( imft ) Â   of $ 2 . 2 Â   billion ( $ 2 . 2 Â   billion as of december Â   29 , 2007 ) . our non-marketable equity investments are classified in other long-term assets on the consolidated condensed balance sheets . non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky , and a number of these companies are likely to fail . their success is dependent on product development , market acceptance , operational efficiency , and other factors . in addition , depending on their future prospects and on market conditions , they may not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations , with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings , and our investments would likely become impaired . we review our investments quarterly for indicators of impairment ; however , for non-marketable equity investments , the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would significantly harm the fair value of the investment . the indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances include : Â   Â • Â   the investee Â ’ s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects ; Â   Â • Â   the technological feasibility of the investee Â ’ s products and technologies ; Â   Â • Â   the general market conditions in the investee Â ’ s industry or geographic area , including adverse regulatory or economic changes ; Â   Â • Â   factors related to the investee Â ’ s ability to remain in business , such as the investee Â ’ s liquidity , debt ratios , and the rate at which the investee is using its cash ; and Â   Â • Â   the investee Â ’ s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation . investments that we identify as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired , in which case we write down the investment to its estimated fair value . we measure fair value using financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies , or a discounted cash flow technique . beginning in the first quarter of 2008 , the assessment of fair value is based on the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards ( sfas ) Â   no . Â   157 , Â “ fair value measurements Â ” ( sfas no . Â   157 ) . non-marketable investments that are considered impaired are classified as level 3 instruments ( see Â “ note 3 : fair value Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q ) , as they use unobservable inputs and require management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices , inherent lack of liquidity , and the long-term nature of such investments . the valuation of our non-marketable equity investments also takes into account movements of the equity and venture capital markets , recent financing activities by the investees , changes in the interest rate environment , the investee Â ’ s capital structure , liquidation preferences for the investee Â ’ s capital , and other economic variables . see Â “ note 3 : fair value Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q for further discussion on the adoption of sfas no . Â   157 . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) approximately $ 3 Â   million of our non-marketable equity investments as of march Â   29 , 2008 were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis due to the recording of other-than-temporary impairment charges . other-than-temporary impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $ 33 million in the first quarter of 2008 . these impairments represented most of the carrying value of the impaired non-marketable equity investments . over the past 12 quarters , including the first quarter of 2008 , impairments of non-marketable equity investments have averaged $ 27 Â   million per quarter ( ranging from $ 10 Â   million to $ 44 Â   million per quarter ) . long-lived assetswe assess the impairment of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable . factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations , significant negative industry or economic trends , and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets . recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows . if an asset grouping Â ’ s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows , the asset grouping is considered to be impaired . the impairment is measured by comparing the difference between the asset grouping Â ’ s carrying amount and its fair value , based on the best information available , including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis . impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows . due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity , we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings . in addition , as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions , we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets , primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements . when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated , we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets Â ’ new , shorter useful lives . over the past 12 quarters , including the first quarter of 2008 , impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets have ranged between $ 1 Â   million and $ 320 Â   million per quarter . the restructuring related asset impairments have ranged between zero and $ 317 Â   million per quarter since the program began in the third quarter of 2006 . over the past 12 quarters , other asset impairments have ranged between $ 1 Â   million and $ 26 Â   million per quarter . long-lived assets such as goodwill , intangible assets , and property , plant , and equipment , are considered non-financial assets , and are only measured at fair value when indicators of impairment exist . therefore , the accounting and disclosure provisions of sfas no . Â   157 will not be effective for these assets until the first quarter of 2009 . see Â “ note 2 : recent accounting pronouncements and accounting changes Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q for further discussion . income taxeswe must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes . these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits , benefits , and deductions , and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities , which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes , as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions . significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period . we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets . if recovery is not likely , we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable . we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated condensed balance sheets . however , should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets , our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely . the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations . in accordance with financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) interpretation no . Â   48 , Â “ accounting for uncertainty in income taxes Â – an interpretation of sfas no . 109 Â ” ( fin 48 ) , and related guidance , we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process . the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit , including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes , if any . the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 % likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement . it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts , as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes . we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis . this evaluation is based on factors including , but not limited to , changes in facts or circumstances , changes in tax law , effectively settled issues under audit , and new audit activity . such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) inventorythe valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality . the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products . the demand forecast is included in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions . product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base , the stage of the product life cycle of our products , consumer confidence , and customer acceptance of our products , as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost . if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly , or if we fail to forecast the demand accurately , we could be required to write off inventory , which would negatively impact our gross margin . share-based compensationtotal share-based compensation during the first quarter of 2008 was $ 219 Â   million ( $ 284 Â   million during the first quarter of 2007 ) . determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock purchase plans at the date of grant require judgment . we use the black-scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of these share-based awards consistent with the provisions of sfas no . Â   123 ( revised 2004 ) , Â “ share-based payment Â ” ( sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) ) . option pricing models , including the black-scholes model , also require the use of input assumptions , including expected volatility , expected life , expected dividend rate , and expected risk-free rate of return . the assumptions for expected volatility and expected life are the two assumptions that significantly affect the grant date fair value . changes in the expected dividend rate and expected risk-free rate of return do not significantly impact the calculation of fair value , and determining these inputs is not highly subjective . we use implied volatility based on freely traded options in the open market , as we believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility . in determining the appropriateness of implied volatility , we considered the following : Â   Â • Â   the volume of market activity of freely traded options , and determined that there was sufficient market activity ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the ability to reasonably match the input variables of freely traded options to those of options granted by the company , such as the date of grant and the exercise price , and determined that the input assumptions were comparable ; and Â   Â   Â • Â   the term of freely traded options used to derive implied volatility , which is generally one to two years , and determined that the length of term was sufficient . due to significant differences in the vesting terms and contractual life of current option grants compared to the majority of our historical grants , management does not believe that our historical share option exercise data provides us with sufficient evidence to estimate expected life . therefore , we use the simplified method of calculating expected life described in the sec Â ’ s staff accounting bulletin 107 ( sab 107 ) , as amended by staff accounting bulletin 110 ( sab 110 ) . we will continue to use the simplified method until we have the historical data necessary to provide a reasonable estimate of expected life , in accordance with sab 107 , as amended by sab 110 . higher volatility and longer expected lives result in an increase to share-based compensation determined at the date of grant . the effect that changes in the volatility and the expected life would have on the weighted average fair value of option awards and the increase in total fair value during the first quarter of 2008 is as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   q12008 Â   Â   Â   weighted average Â   Â   increase in total Â   Â   Â   fair value per Â   Â   fair value1 Â   Â   Â   share Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   as reported Â   $ 6 . 61 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   hypothetical : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   increase expected volatility by 5 Â   percentage points2 Â   $ 7 . 36 Â   Â   $ 1 Â   increase expected life by 1 Â   year Â   $ 6 . 87 Â   Â   $ Â — Â   Â   1 Â   amounts represent the hypothetical increase in the total fair value determined at the date of grant , which would be amortized over the service period , net of estimated forfeitures . Â   2 Â   for example , an increase from 38 % reported volatility for q1 2008 to a hypothetical 43 % volatility . since the adoption of sfas no .

Â   123 ( r ) requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share-based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover . quarterly adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on reported share-based compensation , as we recognize the cumulative effect of the rate adjustments for all expense amortization after january Â   1 , 2006 in the period the estimated forfeiture rates are adjusted . we estimate and adjust forfeiture rates based on a quarterly review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover . if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate , we make an adjustment that will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements . if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate , we make an adjustment that will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements . these adjustments affect our gross margin ; r & d expenses ; and marketing , general and administrative expenses . the effect of forfeiture adjustments in the first quarter of 2008 was not significant . we record cumulative adjustments to the extent that the related expense is recognized in the financial statements , beginning with implementation of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) in the first quarter of 2006 . adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates could also cause changes in the amount of expense that we recognize in future periods . results of operations first quarter of 2008 compared to first quarter of 2007the following table sets forth certain consolidated condensed statements of income data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   q12008 Â   Â   q12007 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   % of net Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   % of net Â   ( dollars in millions , except per share amounts ) Â   dollars Â   Â   revenue Â   Â   dollars Â   Â   revenue Â   net revenue Â   $ 9 , 673 Â   Â   Â   100 . 0 % Â   $ 8 , 852 Â   Â   Â   100 . 0 % cost of sales Â   Â   4 , 466 Â   Â   Â   46 . 2 % Â   Â   4 , 420 Â   Â   Â   49 . 9 % Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   gross margin Â   Â   5 , 207 Â   Â   Â   53 . 8 % Â   Â   4 , 432 Â   Â   Â   50 . 1 % research and development Â   Â   1 , 467 Â   Â   Â   15 . 2 % Â   Â   1 , 400 Â   Â   Â   15 . 8 % marketing , general and administrative Â   Â   1 , 349 Â   Â   Â   13 . 9 % Â   Â   1 , 282 Â   Â   Â   14 . 5 % restructuring and asset impairment charges Â   Â   329 Â   Â   Â   3 . 4 % Â   Â   75 Â   Â   Â   0 . 9 % Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   operating income Â   Â   2 , 062 Â   Â   Â   21 . 3 % Â   Â   1 , 675 Â   Â   Â   18 . 9 % gains ( losses ) Â   on equity investments , net Â   Â   ( 59 ) Â   Â   ( 0 . 6 ) % Â   Â   29 Â   Â   Â   0 . 4 % interest and other , net Â   Â   168 Â   Â   Â   1 . 7 % Â   Â   169 Â   Â   Â   1 . 9 % Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   income before taxes Â   Â   2 , 171 Â   Â   Â   22 . 4 % Â   Â   1 , 873 Â   Â   Â   21 . 2 % provision for taxes Â   Â   728 Â   Â   Â   7 . 5 % Â   Â   237 Â   Â   Â   2 . 7 % Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   net income Â   $ 1 , 443 Â   Â   Â   14 . 9 % Â   $ 1 , 636 Â   Â   Â   18 . 5 % Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   diluted earnings per share Â   $ 0 . 25 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   $ 0 . 28 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   the following table sets forth information of geographic regions for the periods indicated : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   q12008 Â   Â   q12007 Â   ( dollars in millions ) Â   revenue Â   Â   % of total Â   Â   revenue Â   Â   % of total Â   asia-pacific Â   $ 4 , 788 Â   Â   Â   50 % Â   $ 4 , 432 Â   Â   Â   50 % americas Â   Â   2 , 016 Â   Â   Â   21 % Â   Â   1 , 727 Â   Â   Â   20 % europe Â   Â   1 , 863 Â   Â   Â   19 % Â   Â   1 , 722 Â   Â   Â   19 % japan Â   Â   1 , 006 Â   Â   Â   10 % Â   Â   971 Â   Â   Â   11 % Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   total Â   $ 9 , 673 Â   Â   Â   100 % Â   $ 8 , 852 Â   Â   Â   100 % Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   our net revenue for q1 2008 was $ 9 . 7 Â   billion , an increase of 9 % compared to q1 2007 . the increase was primarily due to significantly higher microprocessor unit sales , which were partially offset by lower microprocessor average selling prices . higher nand flash memory revenue was partially offset by lower nor flash memory revenue , which declined $ 112 Â   million to $ 330 Â   million in q1 2008 due to lower nor flash memory volume and average selling prices . higher nand flash memory revenue was due to an increase in unit sales associated with the ramp of our nand flash memory business . revenue in the americas region increased by 17 % compared to q1 2007 . in addition , revenue in the asia-pacific and europe regions each increased by 8 % and revenue in the japan region increased by 4 % compared to q1 2007 . revenue from both mature and emerging markets increased in q1 2008 compared to q1 2007 . most of the revenue growth in mature markets occurred in the asia-pacific and americas regions . a majority of the increase in emerging markets occurred in the europe region . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) our overall gross margin dollars for q1 2008 were $ 5 . 2 Â   billion , an increase of $ 775 Â   million , or 17 % , compared to q1 2007 . our overall gross margin percentage increased to 53 . 8 % in q1 2008 , from 50 . 1 % in q1 2007 . the increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage increase in the digital enterprise group operating segment , partially offset by the gross margin percentage decline in the mobility group operating segment . we derived most of our overall gross margin dollars and operating profit in q1 2008 and q1 2007 from the sale of microprocessors in the digital enterprise group and mobility group operating segments . see Â “ business outlook Â ” for a discussion of gross margin expectations . digital enterprise groupthe revenue and operating income for the digital enterprise group ( deg ) Â   operating segment for q1 2008 and q1 2007 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   q12008 Â   Â   q12007 Â   microprocessor revenue Â   $ 4 , 123 Â   Â   $ 3 , 561 Â   chipset , motherboard , and other revenue Â   Â   1 , 175 Â   Â   Â   1 , 193 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   net revenue Â   $ 5 , 298 Â   Â   $ 4 , 754 Â   operating income Â   $ 1 , 722 Â   Â   $ 931 Â   net revenue for the deg operating segment increased by $ 544 Â   million , or 11 % , in q1 2008 compared to q1 2007 . microprocessors within deg include microprocessors designed for the desktop and enterprise computing market segments as well as embedded microprocessors . the increase in microprocessor revenue was due to higher enterprise unit sales , and to a lesser extent , higher desktop unit sales . this higher mix of enterprise microprocessor unit sales also had a positive impact on total average selling prices within the deg operating segment . chipset , motherboard , and other revenue was approximately flat , with lower motherboard unit sales offset by higher chipset revenue . operating income increased by $ 791 Â   million , or 85 % , in q1 2008 compared to q1 2007 . the increase in operating income was due to higher microprocessor revenue , and to a lesser extent , lower desktop microprocessor unit costs , lower factory underutilization charges of $ 130 Â   million , and lower start-up costs of $ 150 Â   million , primarily due to the completion of the startup phase and qualification for sale of our 45-nanometer process technology . these increases were partially offset by sales in q1 2007 of desktop microprocessor inventory that had been previously written off . mobility groupthe revenue and operating income for the mobility group ( mg ) Â   operating segment for q1 2008 and q1 2007 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   q12008 Â   Â   q12007 Â   microprocessor revenue Â   $ 2 , 726 Â   Â   $ 2 , 441 Â   chipset and other revenue Â   Â   943 Â   Â   Â   866 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   net revenue Â   $ 3 , 669 Â   Â   $ 3 , 307 Â   operating income Â   $ 1 , 185 Â   Â   $ 1 , 382 Â   net revenue for the mg operating segment increased by $ 362 Â   million , or 11 % , in q1 2008 compared to q1 2007 . the increase in microprocessor revenue was due to significantly higher unit sales , partially offset by significantly lower average selling prices . the increase in chipset and other revenue was due to higher unit sales of chipsets , partially offset by lower revenue from sales of cellular baseband products . we are winding down the sales from the manufacturing agreement entered into as part of the divestiture of the cellular baseband products business . operating income decreased by $ 197 Â   million , or 14 % , in q1 2008 compared to q1 2007 . the decrease in operating income was primarily due to higher operating expenses related to process development and advertising . higher chipset unit costs and sales in q1 2007 of mobility microprocessor inventory that had been previously written off were more than offset by lower microprocessor unit costs and higher microprocessor and chipset revenue .

Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) we estimate that employee severance and benefit charges to date will result in gross annual savings of approximately $ 1 . 0 Â   billion , a portion of which we began to realize as early as q3 2006 . we are realizing these savings within marketing , general and administrative expenses , cost of sales , and r & d . our outlook for q2 2008 is for additional restructuring and asset impairment charges of $ 250 million . we may incur additional restructuring charges in the future for employee severance and benefit arrangements , as well as facility-related or other exit activities . gains ( losses ) on equity investments , interest and other , and provision for taxesgains ( losses ) Â   on equity investments , net ; interest and other , net ; and provision for taxes for q1 2008 and q1 2007 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   q12008 Â   Â   q12007 Â   gains ( losses ) Â   on equity investments , net Â   $ ( 59 ) Â   $ 29 Â   interest and other , net Â   $ 168 Â   Â   $ 169 Â   provision for taxes Â   $ ( 728 ) Â   $ ( 237 ) gains ( losses ) Â   on equity investments , net , for q1 2008 was a net loss of $ 59 Â   million compared to a net gain of $ 29 Â   million in q1 2007 . in q1 2008 , we recognized higher losses from our equity method investments , primarily from our investment in clearwire corporation . in addition , gains ( losses ) Â   on equity investments , net , for q1 2007 included a gain of $ 39 Â   million as a result of the initial public offering of clearwire . interest and other , net was approximately flat at $ 168 Â   million in q1 2008 compared to $ 169 Â   million in q1 2007 . approximately $ 60 Â   million of fair value losses experienced in q1 2008 on our trading assets were offset by a $ 39 Â   million gain on divestiture in q1 2008 and higher interest income . interest income was higher in q1 2008 compared to q1 2007 as a result of higher average investment balances , partially offset by lower interest rates . for details of our net losses recognized within gains ( losses ) Â   on equity investments , net and interest and other , net , attributable to financial instruments categorized as level 3 under the sfas no .

Â   159 , Â “ the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities Â — including an amendment of fasb statement no . 115 Â ” ( sfas no . Â   159 ) . accounts receivable were higher compared to december Â   29 , 2007 , despite decreased revenue , due to a higher proportion of sales occurring at the end of the first quarter of 2008 and lower cash collections . for the first quarter of 2008 , our two largest customers accounted for 38 % of net revenue ( 34 % for the first quarter of 2007 ) , with each of these customers accounting for 19 % of revenue . additionally , these two largest customers accounted for 41 % of net accounts receivable at march Â   29 , 2008 ( 33 % at march Â   31 , 2007 ) . investing activitiesinvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures and net investment purchases , maturities , and disposals , and purchases and investments in non-marketable and other investments . the decrease in cash used in investing activities in the first quarter of 2008 , compared to the first quarter of 2007 , was primarily due to an increase in maturities and a decrease in purchases of available-for-sale investments as well as lower capital spending . purchases and investments in non-marketable equity investments were lower in the first quarter of 2008 due to an additional $ 288 million investment in imft in the first quarter of 2007 . in addition , due to the adoption of sfas no . Â   159 , purchases and maturities for marketable debt instruments classified as trading assets are included in investing activity for the first quarter of 2008 . financing activitiesfinancing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases and retirement of common stock , payment of dividends to stockholders , and proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans . the higher cash used in financing activities in the first quarter of 2008 , compared to the first quarter of 2007 , was primarily due to an increase in repurchases and retirement of common stock . for the first quarter of 2008 , we purchased 121 . 9 Â   million shares of common stock as part of our common stock repurchase program at a cost of $ 2 . 5 Â   billion compared to 19 . 2 Â   million shares for $ 400 million in the first quarter of 2007 . as of march Â   29 , 2008 , $ 12 . 0 Â   billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization of $ 25 Â   billion . we base our level of stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions , and this level may fluctuate . our dividend payment was $ 739 Â   million in the first quarter of 2008 , higher than the $ 650 Â   million paid in the same period of the prior year , due to an increase from $ 0 . 1125 to $ 0 . 1275 in quarterly cash dividends per common share effective for the first quarter of 2008 . on march Â   19 , 2008 , our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $ 0 . 14 per common share for the second quarter of 2008 , which represents an additional 10 % increase in our quarterly cash dividend amount . additional financing activities for the first quarter of 2008 include proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee equity incentive plans of $ 468 Â   million ( $ 586 Â   million during the first quarter of 2007 ) . liquiditycash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity . as of march Â   29 , 2008 , we also had an investment portfolio valued at $ 17 . 7 Â   billion , consisting of cash and cash equivalents , fixed-income trading assets , and short- and long-term investments . substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with a / a2 or better rated issuers , and the substantial majority of the issuers are rated aa- / aa2 or better . as of march Â   29 , 2008 , $ 11 . 6 Â   billion of our portfolio had a remaining maturity of less than one year . during the first quarter of 2008 , we did not recognize significant other-than-temporary impairments on our portfolio of available-for-sale investments . as of march Â   29 , 2008 , our cumulative unrealized losses , net of corresponding hedging activities , related to debt instruments classified as trading assets was $ 58 Â   million , of which a loss of $ 35 Â   million was recognized in the first quarter of 2008 . as of march Â   29 , 2008 , our cumulative unrealized losses , net of corresponding hedging activities , related to debt instruments classified as available-for-sale was $ 66 Â   million . these unrealized losses were insignificant in relation to our total available-for-sale portfolio . substantially all of our unrealized losses can be attributed to fair value fluctuations in an unstable credit environment . our portfolio includes $ 1 . 8 Â   billion of asset-backed securities as of march Â   29 , 2008 . approximately one-third of these securities were collateralized by first-lien mortgages , and the remaining were collateralized by credit card debt , student loans , or auto loans . during the first quarter of 2008 , our asset-backed securities experienced net unrealized fair value declines totaling $ 37 Â   million , of which $ 34 Â   million was recognized in our consolidated condensed statements of income . as of march 29 , 2008 , substantially all of our investments in asset-backed securities were rated aaa / aaa , and the expected weighted average remaining maturity was less than two years . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) we have the intent and ability to hold our debt investments that have unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amounts invested . we continually monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and mitigate our credit and interest rate exposures in accordance with the policies approved by our board of directors . we intend to continue to closely monitor future developments in the credit markets and make appropriate changes to our investment policy as deemed necessary . based on our ability to liquidate our investment portfolio and our expected operating cash flows , we do not anticipate any liquidity constraints as a result of either the current credit environment or potential investment fair value fluctuations . another potential source of liquidity is authorized borrowings for commercial paper , of up to $ 3 . 0 billion . there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program during the first quarter of 2008 . our commercial paper was rated a-1 + by standard & poor Â ’ s and p-1 by moody Â ’ s as of march Â   29 , 2008 . we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec pursuant to which we may offer an indeterminate amount of debt , equity , and other securities . we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 Â   months , including capital expenditures for the expansion or upgrading of worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test capacity , working capital requirements , the dividend program , potential stock repurchases , and potential acquisitions or strategic investments . off-balance-sheet arrangementsas of march Â   29 , 2008 , we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements , as defined in item Â   303 ( a ) ( 4 ) ( ii ) of sec regulation Â   s-k . subsequent to the end of the first quarter , we have guaranteed the repayment of $ 275 Â   million in principal of numonyx Â ’ s payment obligations under its senior credit facility , as well as accrued unpaid interest , expenses of the lenders and penalties . see Â “ note 12 : divestitures Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q for further discussion . fair valuebeginning in the first quarter of 2008 , the assessment of fair value for our financial instruments is based on the provisions of sfas no . Â   157 . sfas no . Â   157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that is based on three levels of inputs and requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value . when values are determined using inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the values of the instruments being measured , we classify those instruments as level 3 under the sfas no . Â   157 hierarchy . as of march Â   29 , 2008 , our portfolio of financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 18 . 6 Â   billion of assets and $ 320 Â   million of liabilities . of these assets , $ 3 . 2 billion ( 17 % ) were classified as level 3 instruments . of these liabilities , $ 160 Â   million ( 50 % ) were classified as level 3 instruments . assets classified as level 3 included net transfers from level 2 to level 3 of approximately $ 455 Â   million in the first quarter of 2008 . these assets primarily consisted of floating-rate notes and were transferred from level 2 to level 3 due to limited availability of observable market data with which to value or corroborate the value of our instruments . during the first quarter of 2008 , we recognized an insignificant amount of losses on these instruments . during the first quarter of 2008 , the level 3 assets and liabilities in our portfolio of financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis experienced net unrealized fair value declines totaling $ 49 Â   million . of these declines , $ 37 Â   million were recognized in our consolidated condensed statements of income . we believe the remaining $ 12 Â   million , included in other comprehensive income , represents a temporary decline in the fair value of available-for-sale investments . we did not experience any realized gains ( losses ) Â   related to the level 3 assets or liabilities in our portfolio . as of march Â   29 , 2008 , investments in floating-rate notes and corporate bonds represented $ 8 . 4 billion ( 45 % ) of our portfolio of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis . of these instruments , $ 189 Â   million were classified as level 1 because their valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets . another $ 6 . 8 Â   billion were classified as level 2 because their valuations were based on one of the following : Â   Â • Â   quoted prices for identical securities from markets that are less active ; Â   Â   Â • Â   quoted prices for similar securities ; Â   Â   Â • Â   indicator prices corroborated by observable market quotes ; or Â   Â   Â • Â   pricing models with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data . the remaining $ 1 . 4 Â   billion of these instruments , the substantial majority of them floating-rate notes , were classified as level 3 because their valuations were based on either : non-binding broker quotes ; or indicator prices that we were unable to corroborate with observable market quotes . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) as of march Â   29 , 2008 , investments in commercial paper , bank time deposits , and money market fund deposits represented $ 6 . 9 Â   billion ( 37 % ) of our portfolio of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis . of these instruments , all $ 1 . 9 Â   billion of the money market fund deposits were classified as level 1 . the remaining instruments were classified as level 2 because their valuations were based on pricing models with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data . as of march Â   29 , 2008 , investments in asset-backed securities represented $ 1 . 8 Â   billion ( 10 % ) of our portfolio of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis . all of these instruments were classified as level 3 , and substantially all of them were valued using indicator prices that we were not able to corroborate by observable market quotes due to the lack of visibility and / or liquidity in the market for asset-backed securities . as of march Â   29 , 2008 , investments in marketable equity securities represented $ 530 Â   million ( 3 % ) of our portfolio of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis . of these instruments , $ 38 million were classified as level 1 because their valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets . the remaining $ 492 Â   million were classified as level 2 because their valuations were either based on quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets or adjusted for security specific restrictions . the fair values of two of these investments , vmware , inc . ( $ 396 Â   million ) and micron ( $ 90 Â   million ) , constituted substantially all of the fair values of the marketable equity securities that we classified as level 2 . in measuring the fair value of our investment in vmware , our valuation reflects a discount from the quoted price of vmware Â ’ s stock due to a transfer restriction . in measuring the fair value of our investment in micron , our valuation reflects a discount from the quoted market price of micron Â ’ s stock due to our investment being in a form of rights exchangeable into unregistered micron stock . as of march Â   29 , 2008 , investments in equity securities offsetting deferred compensation represented $ 454 Â   million ( 2 % ) of our portfolio of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis . all of these instruments were classified as level 1 because their valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets . business outlookour future results of operations and the topics of other forward-looking statements contained in this form 10-q , including this md & a , involve a number of risks and uncertainties Â — in particular , our goals and strategies ; new product introductions ; plans to cultivate new businesses ; pending divestitures ; future economic conditions ; revenue ; pricing ; gross margin and costs ; capital spending ; depreciation ; r & d expenses ; marketing , general and administrative expenses ; potential impairment of investments ; our effective tax rate ; pending legal proceedings ; net gains ( losses ) from equity investments ; and interest and other , net . we are focusing on efforts to improve operational efficiency and reduce spending that may result in several actions that could have an impact on expense levels and gross margin . in addition to the various important factors discussed above , a number of other important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations . see the risks described in Â “ risk factors Â ” in part Â   ii , item Â   1a of this form 10-q . our expectations for the second quarter of 2008 are as follows : Â   Â • Â   revenue : Â   Â   Â • Â   gross margin : Â   Â   Â • Â   depreciation : Â   Â   Â • Â   total spending : Â   Â   Â • Â   restructuring and asset impairment charges : Â   Â   Â • Â   net gains from equity investments and interest and other : Â   Â   Â • Â   tax rate : our expectations for fiscal year 2008 are as follows : Â   Â • Â   gross margin : Â   Â   Â • Â   depreciation : Â   Â   Â • Â   r & d spending : Â   Â   Â • Â   marketing , general and administrative expenses : Â   Â   Â • Â   capital spending : Â   Â   Â • Â   tax rate : Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) status of business outlook and scheduled business updatewe expect that our corporate representatives will , from time to time , meet privately with investors , investment analysts , the media , and others , and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the Â “ business outlook Â ” section and elsewhere in this form 10-q , including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this form 10-q . at the same time , we will keep this form 10-q and our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site at www . intc . comfrom the close of business on may Â   30 , 2008 until our quarterly earnings release is published , presently scheduled for july Â   15 , 2008 , we will observe a Â “ quiet period .

Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) our overall gross margin dollars for the third quarter of 2007 increased 27 % compared to the second quarter of 2007 , and increased 20 % compared to the third quarter of 2006 . our overall gross margin percentage for the third quarter of 2007 was 51 . 2 % , compared to 46 . 9 % in the second quarter of 2007 and 49 . 1 % in the third quarter of 2006 . overall higher revenue , lower start-up costs , and lower microprocessor unit costs contributed to the increase in gross margin . these increases were partially offset by inventory write-offs as we ramped our new 45-nanometer process technology and built products that had not yet qualified for sale . in addition , a litigation settlement agreement with transmeta corporation reduced gross margin in the third quarter by 1 . 2 Â   percentage points . our operating income increased by 56 % from the third quarter of 2006 due in part to strong and growing worldwide demand across all geographies and business segments . chipset orders increased in the third quarter and we have entered the fourth quarter anticipating a strong demand environment . as a result , factory utilization is near capacity , driving unit costs lower and improving our operating income . we have experienced , and expect to continue to experience , an overall shift in sales mix from desktop microprocessors to mobile microprocessors . mobility microprocessor revenue increased by 18 % compared to the second quarter of 2007 , and by 26 % compared to the third quarter of 2006 . we believe that our mobile microprocessors unit sales will surpass our desktop microprocessor unit sales in 2009 . due to the wide price differences among mobile , desktop , and server microprocessors , the mix and types of performance capabilities of microprocessors sold affect the average selling price of our products and have a substantial impact on our revenue . our results also have benefited greatly from our technological innovations and our strong product line up . during the third quarter of 2007 we launched our first quad-core product designed for high-end multi-processor servers . this launch completes our transition to the core microarchitecture across all product lines . in november , we plan to launch our penryn family of processors using our next-generation 45-nanometer process technology , which we believe will further extend our technology leadership . as we ramp our 45-nanometer process technology , we expect to see positive impacts to our gross margin as our start-up costs decrease and we transition costs from manufacturing to research and development . our next generation microarchitecture is currently scheduled for production in the second half of 2008 , which is in line with our stated plan to introduce a new microarchitecture approximately every two years and ramp the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years . the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid advances in technology and new product introductions . our failure to respond quickly to technological developments and incorporate new features into our products could harm our ability to compete . our ongoing restructuring efforts also contributed to our improved operating income . results for the third quarter of 2007 include restructuring and asset impairment charges of $ 125 Â   million and we continue to implement plans to improve our business efficiencies to reduce costs . our headcount of 88 , 100 has decreased by 11 , 800 employees compared to the third quarter of 2006 and we expect headcount to continue to decline to approximately 86 , 000 by year-end . spending as a percentage of revenue has decreased from 32 % in the third quarter of 2006 to 29 % in the third quarter of 2007 . from a financial condition perspective , we ended the third quarter of 2007 with $ 10 . 8 Â   billion in cash and short-term investments , and returned $ 1 . 25 Â   billion to stockholders through stock repurchases and $ 2 . 0 Â   billion as dividends during the first nine months of 2007 . we entered into a definitive agreement in may Â   2007 to form a private , independent nor flash memory company with stmicroelectronics n . v . and francisco partners l . p . in october Â   2007 , we received clearance from the u . s . federal trade commission to proceed with the numonyx flash memory transaction . subject to satisfaction of the other closing conditions , we expect the transaction to close by the end of the fourth quarter of 2007 . see Â “ note 13 : pending divestiture Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q for further discussion . in october Â   2007 , stacy j . smith was appointed chief financial officer , succeeding andy d . bryant who was appointed chief administrative officer . mr .

Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) investments identified as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired , in which case we write down the investment to its estimated fair value . when an investee is not considered viable from a financial or technological point of view , we write off the investment , since we consider the estimated fair value to be nominal . if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount or requires a new round of equity funding to stay in operation and the new funding does not appear imminent , we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired , unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise . impairments of investments in our portfolio of non-marketable equity investments were $ 26 Â   million in the third quarter of 2007 and $ 106 Â   million for the first nine months of 2007 ( $ 14 Â   million in the third quarter of 2006 and $ 47 Â   million for the first nine months of 2006 ) . over the past twelve quarters , including the third quarter of 2007 , impairments of investments in our portfolio of non-marketable equity investments have ranged between $ 10 Â   million and $ 44 Â   million per quarter . income taxes . we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets . if recovery is not likely , we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable . we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated condensed balance sheets . however , should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets , our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery is not likely . in addition , the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations . in the first quarter of 2007 , we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no . Â   48 , Â “ accounting for uncertainty in income taxes Â – an interpretation of fasb statement no . Â   109 Â ” ( fin 48 ) , and related guidance . see Â “ note 16 : taxes Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q for further discussion . as a result of the implementation of fin 48 , we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process prescribed within the interpretation . the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit , including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes , if any . the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 % likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement . it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts , as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes . we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis . this evaluation is based on factors including , but not limited to , changes in facts or circumstances , changes in tax law , effectively settled issues under audit , and new audit activity . such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision . long-lived assets . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows . due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity , we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings . in addition , as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions , we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets , primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements . when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated , and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the assets , we accelerate the rate of depreciation charges in order to depreciate the assets over their new shorter useful lives . impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets were $ 111 Â   million during the third quarter of 2007 and $ 181 Â   million for the first nine months of 2007 ( less than $ 20 Â   million in the third quarter of 2006 and first nine months of 2006 ) . over the past twelve quarters , including the third quarter of 2007 , impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets have ranged between $ 1 Â   million and $ 320 Â   million per quarter . this range includes restructuring charges for asset impairments occurring since the fourth quarter of 2006 . inventory . share-based compensation . we use implied volatility based on freely traded options in the open market , as we believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility . in determining the appropriateness of implied volatility , we considered the following : Â   Â • Â   the volume of market activity of freely traded options , and determined that there was sufficient market activity ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the ability to reasonably match the input variables of freely traded options to those of options granted by the company , such as the date of grant and the exercise price , and determined that the input assumptions were comparable ; and Â   Â   Â • Â   the term of freely traded options used to derive implied volatility , which is generally one to two years , and determined that the length of term was sufficient . we use the simplified calculation of expected life described in the u . s . securities and exchange commission Â ’ s staff accounting bulletin 107 ( sab 107 ) , due to differences in the vesting terms and contractual life of current option grants compared to our historical grants . the simplified calculation of expected life is allowed under sab 107 through the end of our 2007 fiscal year . we are currently analyzing the historical option exercise behavior of our employees to establish a new method for estimating expected life . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) higher volatility and longer expected lives result in an increase to share-based compensation determined at the date of grant . the effect that changes in the volatility and the expected life would have on the weighted average fair value of grants and the increase in total fair value during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2007 is as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   q3 2007 Â   Â   ytd 2007 Â   Â   Â   weighted Â   Â   increase in total Â   Â   weighted Â   Â   increase in total Â   Â   Â   average Â   Â   fair value1 Â   Â   average Â   Â   fair value1 Â   Â   Â   fair value Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   Â   fair value Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   as reported Â   $ 6 . 85 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   $ 5 . 26 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   hypothetical : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   increase expected volatility by 5 Â   percentage points2 Â   $ 7 . 71 Â   Â   $ Â — Â   Â   $ 6 . 03 Â   Â   $ 14 Â   increase expected lives by 1 Â   year Â   $ 7 . 48 Â   Â   $ Â — Â   Â   $ 5 . 72 Â   Â   $ Â   Â   9 Â   Â   Â   1 Â   amounts represent the hypothetical increase in the total fair value determined at the date of grant , which is amortized over the vesting period , net of estimated forfeitures . Â   Â   2 Â   for example , an increase from 28 % as reported volatility for q3 2007 to a hypothetical 33 % volatility . in addition , sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share-based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover . quarterly adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on reported share-based compensation , as we recognize the cumulative effect of the rate adjustments for all expense amortization after january Â   1 , 2006 in the period the estimated forfeiture rates are adjusted . we estimate and adjust forfeiture rates based on a quarterly review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover . if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate , we make an adjustment that will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements . if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate , we make an adjustment that will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements . these adjustments affect our gross margin ; research and development expenses ; and marketing , general and administrative expenses . the effect of forfeiture adjustments in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2007 was insignificant . we record cumulative adjustments to the extent that the related expense is recognized in the financial statements , beginning with implementation of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) in the first quarter of 2006 . therefore , the potential impact from cumulative forfeiture adjustments will increase in future periods . the expense that we recognize in future periods could also differ significantly from the current period and from our forecasts due to adjustments in the assumed forfeiture rates .

billion , an increase of 15 % compared to q3 2006 . the primary driver of the increase in revenue was a significant increase in microprocessor and chipset unit sales . our q3 2007 revenue in the asia-pacific region increased 21 % , revenue in the europe region increased 13 % , revenue in the americas region increased 9 % , and revenue in japan increased 8 % compared to q3 2006 . revenue from both mature and emerging markets increased in q3 2007 compared to q3 2006 . while the increase in mature markets occurred in all four geographic regions , the majority of the growth in revenue occurred in the asia-pacific region . a substantial majority of the increase in emerging markets also occurred in the asia-pacific region . our overall gross margin dollars increased significantly by 20 % in q3 2007 compared to q3 2006 . our overall gross margin percentage increased to 51 . 2 % in q3 2007 , from 49 . 1 % in q3 2006 . as a result of a litigation settlement agreement with transmeta , we recorded a $ 113 Â   million charge to cost of sales , of which $ 84 Â   million was allocated to the digital enterprise group operating segment and $ 29 million was allocated to the mobility group operating segment . the charge related to this settlement with transmeta reduced the q3 2007 gross margin by 1 . 2 Â   percentage points . see Â “ note 19 : contingencies Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q for further discussion . the increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to gross margin increases in the digital enterprise group operating segment , partially offset by gross margin declines in the mobility group operating segment . we derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars and operating profit from the sale of microprocessors in q3 2006 , and most of our overall gross margin dollars and operating profit from the sale of microprocessors in q3 2007 . see Â “ business outlook

Â   the rate for the first nine months of 2007 includes the reversal of previously accrued taxes of $ 481 Â   million ( including $ 50 Â   million of accrued interest ) relating to settlements with the u . s . internal revenue service ( irs ) Â   in the first and second quarters of 2007 . see Â “ note 16 : taxes Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q for further discussion . the tax rate for the first nine months of 2007 was also positively impacted by higher domestic manufacturing deduction benefits and higher research and development credits ; however , this was mostly offset by the elimination of the tax benefit for export sales . liquidity and capital resourcescash , short-term investments , fixed income debt instruments included in trading assets , and debt at the end of each period were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   sept . 29 , Â   Â   dec . 30 , Â   ( dollars in millions ) Â   2007 Â   Â   2006 Â   cash , short-term investments , and fixed income debt instruments included in trading assets Â   $ 12 , 528 Â   Â   $ 9 , 552 Â   short-term and long-term debt Â   Â   $ 1 , 990 Â   Â   $ 2 , 028 Â   debt as % of stockholders Â ’ equity Â   Â   4 . 9 % Â   Â   5 . 5 % in summary , our cash flows were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   nine months ended Â   Â   Â   sept . 29 , Â   Â   sept . 30 , Â   ( in millions ) Â   2007 Â   Â   2006 Â   net cash provided by operating activities Â   Â   $ 7 , 853 Â   Â   $ 6 , 449 Â   net cash used for investing activities Â   Â   Â   ( 7 , 764 ) Â   Â   ( 3 , 323 ) net cash used for financing activities Â   Â   ( 843 ) Â   Â   ( 5 , 981 ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   net increase ( decrease ) Â   in cash and cash equivalents Â   $ ( 754 ) Â   $ ( 2 , 855 ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   operating activitiescash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities . the increase in cash provided by operating activities for the first nine months of 2007 compared to the first nine months of 2006 was primarily due to lower inventory levels and higher net income in the first nine months of 2007 partially offset by higher purchases of trading assets . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) inventories as of september Â   29 , 2007 decreased compared to december Â   30 , 2006 levels , with the substantial majority of the decline due to lower microprocessor inventory , and to a lesser extent lower chipset inventory . trading assets increased compared to december Â   30 , 2006 , primarily due to purchases exceeding maturities . additionally , accounts receivable as of september Â   29 , 2007 increased compared to december Â   30 , 2006 , due to higher revenue . for the first nine months of 2007 , our two largest customers accounted for 34 % of net revenue , with one of these customers accounting for 18 % of revenue and another customer accounting for 16 % . for the first nine months of 2006 , these two largest customers accounted for 35 % of net revenue . additionally , these two largest customers accounted for 42 % of net accounts receivable at september Â   29 , 2007 ( 46 % at september Â   30 , 2006 ) . investing activitiesinvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures , net investment purchases , maturities and disposals , and purchases and investments in non-marketable and other investments . the increase in cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of 2007 , compared to the first nine months of 2006 , was primarily due to increased purchases of available-for-sale investments partially offset by lower capital spending . capital spending has decreased in the first nine months of 2007 to $ 3 . 7 Â   billion compared to $ 4 . 7 Â   billion in the first nine months of 2006 . financing activitiesfinancing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases and retirement of common stock , payment of dividends to stockholders , and proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans . the lower cash used in financing activities in the first nine months of 2007 , compared to the first nine months of 2006 , was primarily due to a decrease in repurchases and retirement of common stock and an increase in proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans . for the first nine months of 2007 , we purchased 54 . 2 Â   million shares of common stock for $ 1 . 25 Â   billion compared to 219 . 4 Â   million shares for $ 4 . 4 Â   billion in the first nine months of 2006 . we base our level of stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions and this level may fluctuate from quarter to quarter . at september Â   29 , 2007 , $ 16 . 0 Â   billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization . for the first nine months of 2007 , proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee equity incentive plans were $ 2 . 2 Â   billion compared to $ 767 Â   million during the first nine months of 2006 as a result of a higher volume of employee exercises of stock options and a higher weighted average exercise price . our dividend payments were $ 2 . 0 Â   billion in the first nine months of 2007 , higher than the $ 1 . 7 Â   billion paid in the same period of the prior year , due to an increase from $ 0 . 10 to $ 0 . 1125 in quarterly cash dividends per common share effective for the first quarter of 2007 . liquiditywe use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity . another potential source of liquidity is authorized borrowings , including commercial paper of up to $ 3 . 0 Â   billion . there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program during the first nine months of 2007 . we also have a shelf registration on file with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) Â   pursuant to which we may offer an indeterminate amount of debt , equity , and other securities . we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 Â   months , including capital expenditures for the expansion or upgrading of worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test capacity , working capital requirements , the dividend program , potential stock repurchases , and potential future acquisitions or strategic investments . contractual obligationsas a result of the adoption of fin 48 , we reclassified unrecognized tax benefits to long-term income taxes payable . long-term income taxes payable includes uncertain tax positions , reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and foreign tax credits , and may also include other certain long-term tax liabilities . as of september Â   29 , 2007 , we had $ 1 . 0 Â   billion of income tax liabilities . we expect to settle / make payments on approximately $ 200 Â   million of these income tax liabilities in the next twelve months . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) business outlookour future results of operations and the other forward-looking statements contained in this form 10-q , including this md & a , involve a number of risks and uncertainties Â — in particular , the statements regarding our goals and strategies , new product introductions , plans to cultivate new businesses , pending divestitures , future economic conditions , revenue , pricing , gross margin and costs , capital spending , depreciation , research and development expenses , potential impairment of investments , the tax rate , and pending legal proceedings . our future results of operations may also be affected by the amount , type , and valuation of share-based awards granted as well as the amount of awards cancelled due to employee turnover and the timing of award exercises by employees . we are focusing on efforts to improve operational efficiency and reduce spending that may result in several actions that could have an impact on expense levels and gross margin . in addition to the various important factors discussed above , a number of other important factors could cause actual results to differ significantly from our expectations . see the risks described in Â “ risk factors Â ” in part Â   ii , item Â   1a of this form Â   10-q . for the fourth quarter of 2007 , we expect revenue to be between $ 10 . 5 Â   billion and $ 11 . 1 Â   billion , compared to our third quarter revenue of $ 10 . 1 Â   billion . the midpoint of this range would be a sequential increase of 7 % , which is at the low end of our seasonal patterns . our microprocessor business generally has followed a seasonal trend ; however , there can be no assurance that this trend will continue . historically , our sales of microprocessors have been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year . consumer purchases of pcs have been higher in the second half of the year , primarily due to back-to-school and holiday demand . in addition , technology purchases from businesses have tended to be higher in the second half of the year . our financial results are substantially dependent on sales of microprocessors . revenue is partly a function of the mix of types and performance capabilities of microprocessors sold , as well as the mix of chipsets , flash memory and other semiconductor products sold , all of which are difficult to forecast . because of the wide price differences among mobile , desktop , and server microprocessors , the mix of types and performance levels of microprocessors sold affects the average selling price that we will realize and has a large impact on our revenue and gross margin . revenue is affected by the timing of new intel product introductions and the demand for and market acceptance of our products ; actions taken by our competitors , including new product offerings and introductions , marketing programs and pricing pressures , and our response to such actions ; our ability to respond quickly to technological developments and to incorporate new features into our products ; and the availability of sufficient components from suppliers to meet demand . factors that could cause demand to be different from our expectations include customer acceptance of our products and our competitors products ; changes in customer order patterns , including order cancellations ; changes in the level of inventory at customers ; and changes in business and economic conditions , including conditions in the credit market that could affect consumer confidence and result in lower than expected demand for our products . we expect the gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter of 2007 to be approximately 57 % , plus or minus a couple of points . the 57 % midpoint is higher than the gross margin of 51 . 2 % in the third quarter , primarily due to expected lower unit costs and a successful ramp of the 45-nanometer manufacturing process . in addition , the third quarter included a $ 113 Â   million charge to cost of sales related to a settlement agreement with transmeta . our gross margin varies with revenue levels , including product mix and pricing ; capacity utilization ; variations in inventory valuation , including variations related to the timing of qualifying products for sale ; excess or obsolete inventory ; manufacturing yields ; changes in unit costs ; impairment of long-lived assets , including manufacturing , assembly and test , and intangible assets ; and the timing and execution of the manufacturing ramp and associated costs , including start-up costs . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) we have continued to expand our semiconductor manufacturing and assembly and test capacity over the last few years , and we continue to plan capacity based on our overall strategy and the acceptance of our products in specific market segments . we currently expect that capital spending in 2007 will be approximately $ 4 . 9 Â   billion , plus or minus $ 200 Â   million . this capital-spending plan is dependent on expectations regarding production efficiencies and delivery times of various machinery and equipment , and construction schedules . if the demand for our products does not grow and continue to move toward higher performance products in the various market segments , revenue and gross margin would be harmed , manufacturing and assembly and test capacity would be underutilized , and the rate of capital spending could be reduced . we could be required to record an impairment of our manufacturing or assembly and test equipment and facilities , or factory-planning decisions may cause us to record accelerated depreciation . in addition , if demand for our products is reduced or we fail to accurately forecast demand , we could be required to write off inventory , which would have a negative impact on our gross margin . however , in the long term , revenue and gross margin may also be affected if we do not add capacity fast enough to meet market demand . we expect depreciation expense to be approximately $ 1 . 1 Â   billion for the fourth quarter of 2007 . spending on research and development , plus marketing , general and administrative expenses ( total spending ) in the fourth quarter of 2007 is expected to be between $ 2 . 8 Â   billion and $ 3 . 0 Â   billion , which is approximately flat compared to the third quarter of 2007 . research and development spending in 2007 is expected to be approximately $ 5 . 8 Â   billion , which is higher than our previous expectation of approximately $ 5 . 7 Â   billion . marketing , general and administrative expenses in 2007 are expected to be approximately $ 5 . 3 Â   billion , which is higher than our previous expectation of approximately $ 5 . 1 Â   billion . we continue to focus on controlling our total spending through cost-saving actions and expect total spending as a percentage of revenue to decrease in 2007 compared to 2006 . restructuring and asset impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2007 are expected to be approximately $ 130 Â   million . expenses , particularly certain marketing and compensation expenses vary depending on the level of demand for our products , the level of revenue and profit , and impairments of long-lived assets . we expect the net gains from equity investments and interest and other for the fourth quarter of 2007 to be approximately $ 150 Â   million . our expectations for gains ( losses ) Â   from equity investments include our expectations for mergers , stock offerings , equity method income / loss , and impairment charges on public and private equity investments , and are based on our experience . it is not possible to know at the present time whether specific investments are likely to be impaired or the extent or timing of individual impairments . in addition , our expectations for gains or losses from equity investments and interest and other could vary depending on fixed income and equity market volatility ; gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities ; gains or losses from equity method investments ; gains or losses realized on divestitures ; impairment charges related to marketable , non-marketable and other investments ; interest rates ; cash balances ; and changes in the fair value of derivative instruments . the tax rate for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately 29 % . the estimated effective tax rate is based on tax law in effect at september Â   29 , 2007 and current expected income . the tax rate may also be affected by the closing of acquisitions or divestitures ; the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed ; changes in estimates of credits , benefits , and deductions ; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities , including payment of interest and penalties ; and the ability to realize deferred tax assets . we believe that we have the product offerings and introductions , facilities , personnel , and competitive and financial resources for continued business success , but future revenue , costs , gross margin , and profits are all influenced by a number of factors , including those discussed above , all of which are inherently difficult to forecast . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) status of business outlook and scheduled business updatewe expect that our corporate representatives will , from time to time , meet privately with investors , investment analysts , the media and others , and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the business outlook section and elsewhere in this form Â   10-q , including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this form Â   10-q . at the same time , we will keep this form Â   10-q and our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site ( www . intc . com ) . the public can continue to rely on the business outlook published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered , unless we publish a notice stating otherwise . the statements in the business outlook and other forward-looking statements in this form Â   10-q are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and sec filings and at other times . from the close of business on november Â   30 , 2007 until our quarterly earnings release is published , presently scheduled for january Â   15 , 2008 , we will observe a Â “ quiet period . Â ” during the quiet period , the business outlook and other forward-looking statements first published in our form 8-k filed on october Â   16 , 2007 , as reiterated or updated as applicable should be considered historical , speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update . during the quiet period , our representatives will not comment on the business outlook or our financial results or expectations . the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period , and any others that we utilize , from time to time , may vary at our discretion .

Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) within a highly competitive market , our desktop and mobile average selling prices remained approximately flat in the first quarter of 2007 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 . however , server average selling prices were lower . while the percentage of server processors we sell with multiple cores is increasing , system builders can obtain similar performance from servers with only one or two multiple core processors compared to servers with multiple single core processors . in line with the shift toward multi-core processors , shipments of our quad-core server processors , which were launched in the fourth quarter of 2006 , nearly doubled in the first quarter of 2007 . although the mix between desktop and mobile remained relatively unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2006 to the first quarter of 2007 , we have experienced , and expect to continue to experience , an overall shift from desktop processors to mobile processors . due to the wide price differences among mobile , desktop , and server microprocessors , the mix and types of performance capabilities of microprocessors sold affect the average selling price of our products and have a substantial impact on our revenue . maintaining scale is key to our strategy of ramping new manufacturing and processor technologies quickly , delivering high performance , and lowering unit costs . our current microprocessor offerings are built on our 65-nanometer process technology . we expect to release our next-generation 45-nanometer products in the second half of 2007 . start-up charges related to these products are expected to be more heavily concentrated in the first half of 2007 . as a result , we expect our gross margins to improve in the second half of 2007 . additionally , as part of our continued focus on technology leadership , we have announced that our next generation microarchitecture will be released in 2008 . in january Â   2007 , we announced that we will begin producing our next-generation penryn family of processors using our industry-leading 45-nanometer hi-k process technology with its hafnium-based high-k + metal gate transistor design , a new material which enables higher and more energy-efficient processor performance . the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid advances in technology and new product introductions . our failure to respond quickly to technological developments and incorporate new features into our products could harm our ability to compete . in addition , our ability to enforce our patents , copyrights , software licenses , and other intellectual property is subject to general litigation risks , as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries . we continue to implement plans to increase our business efficiencies to reduce costs . headcount has declined from 103 , 300 in the first quarter of 2006 to 91 , 800 in the first quarter of 2007 . spending in the first quarter of 2007 was $ 529 Â   million lower than the first quarter of 2006 . as a percentage of revenue , spending has declined nearly six percentage points from the first quarter of 2006 . results for the first quarter of 2007 included restructuring and asset impairment charges of $ 75 million . from a financial condition perspective , we ended the first quarter of 2007 with $ 7 . 6 Â   billion in cash and short-term investments , and returned $ 400 Â   million to stockholders through stock repurchases and $ 650 Â   million as dividends during the first quarter of 2007 . other highlights & product releases Â   Â • Â   we announced plans to invest $ 2 . 5 Â   billion to build a 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility in dalian , china and to invest $ 300 Â   million to build a semiconductor assembly and test facility in ho chi minh city , vietnam . additionally , we announced that our rio rancho , new mexico fabrication facility will be re-tooled to become the company Â ’ s fourth 300-millimeter fabrication facility capable of producing 45-nanometer microprocessors . Â   Â • Â   intel and sun microsystems , inc . announced a broad strategic alliance that will result in sun delivering a comprehensive family of enterprise and telecommunications servers and workstations based on intel Â ® Â ® Â   Â • Â   we launched two quad-core intel Â ® Â ® Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   Â • Â   we introduced the intel Â ® Â ® Â   Â • Â   we launched the intel Â ® strategyour strategy focuses on considering customer needs when developing the next generation of products and platforms . in turn , our products and platforms help enable the design and development of new form factors and usage models for businesses and consumers . we believe that end users , original equipment manufacturers ( oems ) , third-party vendors , and service providers of computing and communications systems and devices want platform products . we define a platform as a collection of ingredients that are designed and configured to work together to provide an optimized end-user solution compared to when the ingredients are sold separately . we refer to the platforms within our product offerings as processor technologies . these processor technologies consist of various product ingredients based on standards and industry initiatives ; hardware and software that may include technologies such as hyper-threading technology ( ht technology ) , intel Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® we also believe that users of computing and communications systems and devices want improved overall performance and energy-efficient performance . improved overall performance can include faster processing performance and other capabilities such as multithreading and multitasking . performance can also be improved through enhanced connectivity , security , manageability , reliability , ease of use , and interoperability among devices . improved energy-efficient performance involves balancing the addition of these and other types of improved performance factors with lower power consumption . lower power consumption may reduce system heat output , thereby providing power savings , and reducing the total cost of ownership for the end user . it is our goal to incorporate these improvements into our various platforms to meet end-user demands . in line with these efforts , we are focusing on further development of multi-core microprocessors . multi-core microprocessors contain two or more processor cores . performance gains from a single core processor typically came from increasing the clock speed at which the core operates , resulting in the use of more power and an increase in heat output . by incorporating multiple cores into our processors , each core is able to run at a lower clock speed , dividing among them the power normally given to a single core , resulting in improved multitasking and energy efficiency . our strategy for developing microprocessors with improved performance is to synchronize the introduction of a new microarchitecture with improvements in silicon process technology . we plan to introduce a new microarchitecture approximately every two years and ramp the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years . this coordinated schedule allows us to develop and introduce new products based on a common microarchitecture quickly , without waiting for the next generation of silicon process technology . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) we make equity investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and to support our key business initiatives , including investments through our intel capital program . we generally focus on investing in companies and initiatives to stimulate growth in the digital economy , create new business opportunities for intel , and expand global markets for our products . the investments may support , for example , intel product initiatives , emerging trends in the technology industry , or worldwide internet deployment . we invest in companies that develop software , hardware , or services supporting our technologies . our current investment focus areas include helping to enable mobile wireless devices ; advancing the digital home ; providing access to premium digital content via the internet ; enhancing the digital enterprise ; advancing high-performance communications infrastructures ; and developing the next generation of silicon production technologies . our focus areas tend to develop and change over time due to rapid advancements in technology . we plan to continue to cultivate new businesses and work with the computing , communications , and consumer electronics industries through standards bodies , trade associations , oems , original design manufacturers , and independent software and operating system vendors , to encourage the industry to offer products that take advantage of the latest market trends and usage models . these efforts include helping to expand the infrastructure for wireless connectivity , including wireless broadband . we also provide development tools and support to help software developers create software applications and operating systems that take advantage of our platform solutions . we frequently participate in industry initiatives designed to discuss and agree upon technical specifications and other aspects of technologies that could be adopted as standards by standards-setting organizations . in addition , we work collaboratively with other companies to protect digital content and the consumer . beginning in the first quarter of 2007 , the channel platforms group began directly supporting intel Â ’ s operating segments . digital enterprise groupthe digital enterprise group ( deg ) Â   designs and offers computing and communications products and platforms for businesses , service providers , and consumers . deg products are incorporated into desktop computers , enterprise computer servers , workstations , and the infrastructure for the internet . we develop platforms based on our processors , chipsets , board-level products , wired connectivity products , and products for network and server storage . deg platforms for businesses are designed to increase employee productivity and reduce total cost of ownership by , for example , enabling remote manageability , diagnosis , and repair of pcs . the products and platforms that deg offers are designed for various market segments , and include microprocessors that are optimized for use in the desktop and server computing market segments ;

Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) flash memory groupthe strategy for the flash memory group is to offer advanced nor and nand flash memory for products such as cellular phones , memory cards , digital audio players , and embedded form factors . in support of our strategy to provide advanced flash memory products we continue to focus on the development of innovative products designed to address the needs of customers for reliable , non-volatile , low cost , high density memory . we offer a broad range of memory densities , leading-edge packaging technology , and high-performance functionality . we offer nor flash memory products such as intel strataflash Â ® we offer a variety of stacked memory products , including products based on our nor flash , as well as our nor flash plus ram or nand flash , which in some instances we purchase from third-party vendors . stacking of memory products refers to packaging several memory chips together which allows for space savings by providing lower profile package heights . digital home groupthe strategy for the digital home group is to design and offer products and platforms for use in consumer products such as pcs , digital tvs , networked media , and devices designed to access the internet and share digital media and other content through a variety of linked digital devices within the home . we are focusing on the design of components for consumer-optimized digital home pcs and other living-room entertainment platforms and applications . we offer intel Â ® Â ® digital health groupthe strategy for the digital health group is to design and deliver technology-enabled products and explore global business opportunities in healthcare information technology , healthcare research , diagnostics , and productivity , as well as personal healthcare . in support of this strategy , the digital health group is focusing on the design of technology solutions and platforms for the digital hospital and consumer / home health products . specifically , the digital health group is focusing on the development of a new category of technology-enabled products and services for home healthcare , including products and services for the elderly and caregivers . the digital health group is also working with standards organizations to advance standards and policies to enable innovation and interoperability across the healthcare ecosystem . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) critical accounting estimatesthe methods , estimates , and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements . some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments , often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain . our most critical accounting estimates include : Â   Â • Â   the valuation of non-marketable equity investments , which impacts net gains ( losses ) Â   on equity investments when we record impairments ; Â   Â • Â   the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities , which impact our tax provision ; Â   Â • Â   the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets , which primarily impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record impairments of assets or accelerate their depreciation ; Â   Â • Â   the valuation of inventory , which impacts gross margin ; and Â   Â • Â   the valuation and recognition of share-based compensation , which impact gross margin , research and development expenses , and marketing , general and administrative expenses . below , we discuss these policies further , as well as the estimates and judgments involved . we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies , such as those for revenue recognition , including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors ; however , these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective . non-marketable equity investments . in the first quarter of 2007 , clearwire corporation became a public company and therefore is no longer considered a non-marketable equity investment . our investment in clearwire remains classified under other long-term assets . see Â “ note 8 : equity investments Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q for further discussion . non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky , and a number of these companies are likely to fail . their success is dependent on product development , market acceptance , operational efficiency , and other factors . in addition , depending on their future prospects and market conditions , they may not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations , with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings , and our investments would likely become impaired . we review our investments quarterly for indicators of impairment ; however , for non-marketable equity investments , the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would significantly harm the fair value of the investment . the indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances include : Â   Â • Â   the investee Â ’ s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects ; Â   Â • Â   the technological feasibility of the investee Â ’ s products and technologies ; Â   Â • Â   the general market conditions in the investee Â ’ s industry or geographic area , including regulatory or economic changes ; Â   Â • Â   factors related to the investee Â ’ s ability to remain in business , such as the investee Â ’ s liquidity , debt ratios , and the rate at which the investee is using its cash ; and Â   Â • Â   the investee Â ’ s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) investments identified as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired , in which case we write-down the investment to its estimated fair value . when an investee is not considered viable from a financial or technological point of view , we write off the investment , since we consider the estimated fair value to be nominal . if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount or requires a new round of equity funding to stay in operation and the new funding does not appear imminent , we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired , unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise . impairments of investments in our portfolio of non-marketable equity investments were $ 36 Â   million in the first quarter of 2007 ( $ 23 Â   million in the first quarter of 2006 ) . over the past twelve quarters , including the first quarter of 2007 , impairments of investments in our portfolio of non-marketable equity investments have ranged between $ 10 Â   million and $ 41 Â   million per quarter . income taxes . we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes . these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits , and deductions , and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities , which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes , as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions . significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period . we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets . if recovery is not likely , we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable . we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated condensed balance sheets . however , should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets , our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not probable . in addition , the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations . as a result of the implementation of fin 48 , we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process prescribed within the interpretation . the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit , including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes , if any . the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 % likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement . it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts , as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes . we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis . this evaluation is based on factors including , but not limited to , changes in facts or circumstances , changes in tax law , effectively settled issues under audit , and new audit activity . such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period . long-lived assets . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows . due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity , we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings . in addition , as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions , we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets , primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements . when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated , and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the assets , we accelerate the rate of depreciation charges in order to depreciate the assets over their new shorter useful lives . impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets were $ 56 Â   million during the first quarter of 2007 ( less than $ 15 million in the first quarter of 2006 ) . over the past twelve quarters , impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets have ranged between $ 1 Â   million and $ 320 Â   million per quarter . this range includes the asset impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of 2007 relating to our communications and application processor business . inventory . share-based compensation . we use implied volatility based on freely traded options in the open market , as we believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility . in determining the appropriateness of implied volatility , we considered the following : Â   Â • Â   the volume of market activity of freely traded options , and determined that there was sufficient market activity ; Â   Â • Â   the ability to reasonably match the input variables of freely traded options to those of options granted by the company , such as the date of grant and the exercise price , and determined that the input assumptions were comparable ; and Â   Â • Â   the length of term of freely traded options used to derive implied volatility , which is generally one to two years , and determined that the length of term was sufficient . we use the simplified calculation of expected life described in the u . s . securities and exchange commission Â ’ s staff accounting bulletin 107 ( sab 107 ) , due to changes in the vesting terms and contractual life of current option grants compared to our historical grants . if we determined that another method used to estimate expected volatility or expected life was more reasonable than our current methods , or if another method for calculating these input assumptions was prescribed by authoritative guidance , the fair value calculated for share-based awards could change significantly . in addition , the simplified calculation of expected life is only allowed under sab 107 through the end of fiscal 2007 , after which time we will determine an alternate method for estimating the useful life of options granted . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) higher volatility and longer expected lives result in an increase to share-based compensation determined at the date of grant . the effect that changes in the volatility and the expected life would have on the weighted average fair value of grants and the increase in total fair value during the first quarter of 2007 is as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   q12007 Â   Â   weighted Â   Â   increase in total Â   Â   average fair Â   Â   fair value1 Â   Â   value per share Â   Â   ( in millions ) as reported Â   Â   $ Â   Â   5 . 78 Â   Â   Â   Â   hypothetical : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   increase expected volatility by 5 Â   percentage points2 Â   Â   $ Â   Â   6 . 58 Â   Â   $ Â   Â   1increase expected life by 1 Â   year Â   Â   $ Â   Â   6 . 16 Â   Â   Â   $ Â   Â   1 Â   1 Â   amounts represent the hypothetical increase in the total fair value determined at the date of grant , which would be amortized over the vesting period , net of estimated forfeitures . Â   2 Â   for example , an increase from 26 % as reported volatility for q1 2007 to a hypothetical 31 % volatility . in addition , sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share-based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover . quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported share-based compensation , as we recognize the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after january Â   1 , 2006 in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed . we estimate and adjust forfeiture rates based on a quarterly review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover . if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate , we make an adjustment that will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements . if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate , we make an adjustment that will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements . these adjustments affect our gross margin ; research and development expenses ; and marketing , general and administrative expenses . the effect of forfeiture adjustments in the first quarter of 2007 and 2006 was insignificant . we record cumulative adjustments to the extent that the related expense is recognized in the financial statements , beginning with implementation of sfas no .

Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) digital enterprise groupthe revenue and operating income for the digital enterprise group operating segment for the first quarter of 2007 and 2006 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   q12007 Â   Â   q12006microprocessor revenue Â   $ 3 , 561 Â   Â   $ 3 , 892chipset , motherboard , and other revenue Â   Â   1 , 193 Â   Â   Â   1 , 255 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   net revenue Â   $ 4 , 754 Â   Â   $ 5 , 147operating income Â   $ 931 Â   Â   $ 1 , 175net revenue for the digital enterprise group operating segment decreased by $ 393 Â   million , or 8 % , in q1 2007 compared to q1 2006 . the decline in net revenue was primarily due to a decline in microprocessor revenue . chipset , motherboard , and other revenue decreased slightly . the decrease in microprocessor revenue was due to lower desktop average selling prices , partially offset by an increase in server average selling prices . the decrease in chipset , motherboard , and other revenue was due to a decrease in chipset revenue . microprocessors within the digital enterprise group include microprocessors designed for the desktop and enterprise computing market segments as well as embedded microprocessors . operating income decreased by $ 244 Â   million , or 21 % , in q1 2007 compared to q1 2006 . the decrease in operating income was primarily due to the revenue decline . approximately $ 180 Â   million of higher start-up costs , primarily related to our 45-nanometer process technology , as well as $ 130 Â   million of higher factory underutilization charges , was offset by lower operating expenses . sales of desktop microprocessor inventory that had been previously written off further offset the decline in revenue . mobility groupthe revenue and operating income for the mobility group operating segment for the first quarter of 2007 and 2006 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   q12007 Â   Â   q12006microprocessor revenue Â   $ 2 , 441 Â   Â   $ 2 , 347chipset and other revenue Â   Â   866 Â   Â   Â   632 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   net revenue Â   $ 3 , 307 Â   Â   $ 2 , 979operating income Â   $ 1 , 381 Â   Â   $ 1 , 050net revenue for the mobility group operating segment increased by $ 328 Â   million , or 11 % , in q1 2007 compared to q1 2006 . microprocessor revenue increased slightly by $ 94 Â   million , or 4 % , in q1 2007 compared to q1 2006 , while chipsets and other revenue increased significantly by $ 234 Â   million , or 37 % , in q1 2007 compared to q1 2006 . the increase in microprocessor revenue was due to higher unit sales , largely offset by lower average selling prices . the substantial majority of the increase in chipset and other revenue was due to higher revenue from sales of chipsets and cellular baseband processors , and to a lesser extent , higher revenue from sales of wireless connectivity products . in december Â   2006 , we sold certain assets of the business line that included application and cellular baseband processors used in handheld devices , however we continue to manufacture and sell these devices as part of a manufacturing and transition services agreement . operating income increased significantly by $ 331 Â   million , or 32 % , in q1 2007 compared to q1 2006 . the increase in operating income was due to higher revenue and lower operating expenses . these increases were partially offset by approximately $ 85 Â   million of higher start-up costs , primarily related to our 45-nanometer process technology . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) flash memory groupthe revenue and operating loss for the flash memory group operating segment for the first quarter of 2007 and 2006 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   q12007 Â   Â   q12006 Â   net revenue Â   $ 469 Â   Â   $ 544 Â   operating loss Â   $ ( 283 ) Â   $ ( 125 ) net revenue for the flash memory group operating segment decreased by $ 75 Â   million , or 14 % , in q1 2007 compared to q1 2006 . the decrease in revenue was due to lower average selling prices of both nor and nand flash memory devices , and lower nor royalties . in q1 2006 , we began shipping nand flash memory products manufactured by imft . operating loss increased from $ 125 Â   million in q1 2006 to $ 283 Â   million in q1 2007 . the operating loss increase was driven by lower overall revenue and higher costs related to our new nand flash memory business , partially offset by lower nor flash memory business operating expenses . share-based compensationshare-based compensation decreased by $ 90 Â   million from $ 374 Â   million in q1 2006 to $ 284 Â   million in q1 2007 . there were fewer options vesting in q1 2007 as compared to q1 2006 . additionally , the weighted average fair value of options vesting was lower in q1 2007 as compared to q1 2006 primarily due to a lower weighted average volatility rate and a lower weighted average grant price . operating expensesoperating expenses for the first quarter of 2007 and 2006 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   q12007 Â   Â   q12006research and development Â   $ 1 , 400 Â   Â   $ 1 , 562marketing , general and administrative Â   $ 1 , 277 Â   Â   $ 1 , 644restructuring and asset impairment charges Â   $ 75 Â   Â   $ Â — amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs Â   $ 5 Â   Â   $ 19research and development . marketing , general and administrativeresearch and development along with marketing , general and administrative expenses were 30 % of net revenue in q1 2007 ( 36 % of net revenue in q1 2006 ) . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) restructuring and asset impairment charges . we did not incur restructuring charges in the first quarter of 2006 . the following table summarizes the restructuring and asset impairment activity for the first quarter of 2007 : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â

  $ 25 Â   Â   $ Â — Â   Â   $ 25 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   the additional accruals , net of adjustments , have been reflected as restructuring and asset impairment charges on the consolidated condensed statements of income . the remaining accrual as of march Â   31 , 2007 relates to severance benefits that we expect to pay within the next 12 Â   months . as such , we record the restructuring accrual as a current liability within accrued compensation and benefits on the consolidated condensed balance sheets . we expect to record additional employee severance and benefit charges of approximately $ 60 Â   million in the second quarter of 2007 . in addition , we may incur restructuring charges in the future for facility-related or other exit activities . we estimate that the employee severance and benefit charges incurred to date under the restructuring plan will result in gross annual savings of approximately $ 650 Â   million . we expect to realize these savings within cost of sales ; research and development ; and marketing , general and administrative expenses . amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) gains on equity investments , interest and other , and provision for taxesgains on equity investments , net ; interest and other , net ; and provision for taxes for the first quarter of 2007 and 2006 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   q12007 Â   Â   q12006gains on equity

for under the equity method and certain equity derivatives , for q1 2007 were $ 29 Â   million compared to $ 2 Â   million for q1 2006 . the increase was primarily due to a gain of $ 39 Â   million realized as a result of clearwire Â ’ s ipo . see Â “ note 8 : equity investments Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q for further discussion . this gain was partially offset by intel Â ’ s proportionate share of clearwire Â ’ s operating loss and higher impairment charges on equity investments ( $ 36 million in q1 2007 and $ 23 Â   million in q1 2006 ) . interest and other , net increased to $ 169 Â   million in q1 2007 compared to $ 154 Â   million in q1 2006 , reflecting higher interest income as a result of higher interest rates , partially offset by lower average investment balances . our effective income tax rate for q1 2007 was 12 . 7 % , compared to 27 . 6 % for q1 2006 . the rate for q1 2007 includes the reversal of previously accrued taxes of $ 326 Â   million relating to a settlement with the u . s . internal revenue service ( irs ) . see Â “ note 14 : taxes Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q for further discussion . the q1 2007 tax rate was also impacted by the elimination of the tax benefit for export sales , however this was partially offset by the impact of higher domestic manufacturing deduction benefits . the rate for q1 2006 includes a tax benefit related to non-u . s . research and development tax credits . liquidity and capital resourcesour financial condition remains strong . cash , short-term investments , fixed income debt instruments included in trading assets , and debt at the end of each period were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â

financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) operating activitiescash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities . the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for the first quarter of 2007 as compared to the first quarter of 2006 is primarily due to higher income tax payments related to the settlement with the irs that was reached in the first quarter of 2007 . trading assets increased compared to december Â   30 , 2006 , primarily due to purchases exceeding maturities . accrued compensation and benefits liabilities decreased compared to december Â   30 , 2006 , primarily due to the payout of 2006 Â   year-end employee bonuses during the first quarter of 2007 . inventories as of march Â   31 , 2007 were approximately flat compared to december Â   30 , 2006 levels . additionally , accounts receivable were slightly higher compared to december Â   30 , 2006 , despite decreased revenue , due to a higher proportion of sales occurring at the end of the first quarter of 2007 and lower cash collections . for the first quarter of 2007 , our two largest customers accounted for 34 % of net revenue , with one of these customers accounting for 18 % of revenue and another customer accounting for 16 % . for the first quarter of 2006 , these two largest customers accounted for 37 % of net revenue . additionally , these two largest customers accounted for 47 % of net accounts receivable at march Â   31 , 2007 ( 49 % at april Â   1 , 2006 ) . investing activitiesinvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures , the proceeds from investment maturities and disposals , and purchases and investments in non-marketable and other equity investments . the increase in cash used in investing activities in the first quarter of 2007 , compared to the first quarter of 2006 , was primarily due to an increase in purchases and a decrease in maturities of available-for-sale investments , partially offset by lower capital spending . purchases and investments in non-marketable equity investments for the first quarter of 2007 included $ 288 Â   million for our investment in imft ( $ 500 Â   million in the first quarter of 2006 ) and $ 67 Â   million for our investment in imfs . financing activitiesfinancing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases and retirement of common stock and payment of dividends to stockholders , partially offset by proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans . the lower cash used in financing activities in the first quarter of 2007 , compared to the first quarter of 2006 , was primarily due to a decrease in repurchases and retirement of common stock . for the first quarter of 2007 , we purchased 19 . 2 Â   million shares of common stock for $ 400 Â   million compared to 138 . 5 Â   million shares for $ 2 . 9 Â   billion in the first quarter of 2006 . we base our level of stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions and this level may fluctuate from quarter to quarter . at march Â   31 , 2007 , $ 16 . 9 Â   billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization . our dividend payments were $ 650 Â   million in the first quarter of 2007 , higher than the $ 585 Â   million paid in the same period of the prior year , due to an increase from $ 0 . 10 to $ 0 . 1125 in cash dividends per common share effective for the first quarter of 2007 , partially offset by lower outstanding shares . additional financing activities for the first quarter of 2007 include proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee equity incentive plans of $ 586 Â   million ( $ 376 Â   million during the first quarter of 2006 ) . liquidityduring the first quarter of 2007 , our level of cash declined as our cash provided by operations was less than our cash used for investing and financing activities . we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity . another potential source of liquidity is authorized borrowings , including commercial paper of $ 3 . 0 Â   billion . there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program during the first quarter of 2007 . we also have a shelf registration on file with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) Â   pursuant to which we may offer an indeterminate amount of debt , equity , and other securities . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 Â   months , including capital expenditures for the expansion or upgrading of worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test capacity , working capital requirements , the dividend program , potential stock repurchases and potential future acquisitions or strategic investments , and cash payments associated with our restructuring plan . employee equity incentive plansour equity incentive plans are broad-based , long-term retention programs that are intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests . under the 2006 equity incentive plan ( the 2006 plan ) , 175 Â   million shares of common stock were made available for issuance as equity awards to employees and non-employee directors through june Â   30 , 2008 . a maximum of 80 Â   million of these shares can be awarded as restricted stock or restricted stock units . we are requesting stockholder approval at our may Â   2007 annual stockholders Â ’ meeting , to extend the term of the 2006 plan by two years , to june Â   30 , 2010 , and make an additional 119 million common shares available for issuance as equity awards to employees and non-employee directors during that period . if approved , the shares of common stock made available for issuance as equity awards would increase to 294 Â   million , of which a maximum of 168 Â   million shares could be awarded as restricted stock or restricted sock units . the 2006 stock purchase plan allows eligible employees to purchase shares of intel Â ’ s common stock at 85 % of the market price on specific dates . under the 2006 stock purchase plan , 240 Â   million shares of common stock were made available for issuance through august Â   2011 . our goal has been to keep the potential incremental dilution related to our equity incentive plans to a long-term average of less than 2 % annually . the dilution percentage is calculated using equity-based awards granted during the period , net of awards cancelled due to employees leaving and expired stock options , divided by the total outstanding shares at the beginning of the year . for purposes of this disclosure , equity-based awards include stock option grants and restricted stock unit grants , but exclude rights granted under the stock purchase plan and awards assumed in connection with acquisitions . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) equity-based awards granted to employees , including officers , and non-employee directors from 2003 through the first quarter of 2007 are summarized as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ytd Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( shares in millions ) Â   2007 Â   2006 Â   2005 Â   2004 Â   2003total equity-based awards granted Â   Â   2 Â   Â   Â   82 Â   Â   Â   119 Â   Â   Â   115 Â   Â   Â   110 Â   less : equity-based awards cancelled Â   Â   ( 34 ) Â   Â   ( 67 ) Â   Â   ( 38 ) Â   Â   ( 32 ) Â   Â   ( 40 ) net equity-based awards granted Â   Â   ( 32 ) Â   Â   15 Â   Â   Â   81 Â   Â   Â   83 Â   Â   Â   70 Â   dilution % -net equity-based awards granted as % of outstanding shares1 Â   Â   n / m2 Â   Â   0 . 2 % Â   Â   1 . 3 % Â   Â   1 . 3 % Â   Â   1 . 1 % equity-based awards granted to listed officers3 Â   Â   38 . 7 % Â   Â   1 . 6 % Â   Â   1 . 4 % Â   Â   1 . 1 % Â   Â   2 . 4 % equity-based awards granted to listed officers3 1 Â   Â   < 0 . 1 % Â   Â   < 0 . 1 % Â   Â   < 0 . 1 % Â   Â   < 0 . 1 % Â   Â   < 0 . 1 % cumulative equity-based awards held by listed officers3 Â   Â   2 . 2 % Â   Â   1 . 9 % Â   Â   1 . 9 % Â   Â   2 . 1 % Â   Â   2 . 1 % share-based compensation434 Â   Â   1 . 4 % Â   Â   1 . 4 % Â   Â   Â — Â   Â   Â   Â — Â   Â   Â   Â — Â   Â   1 Â   outstanding shares as of the beginning of each period .

Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) business outlookour future results of operations and the other forward-looking statements contained in this form 10-q , including this md & a , involve a number of risks and uncertainties Â — in particular , the statements regarding our goals and strategies , new product introductions , plans to cultivate new businesses , future economic conditions , revenue , pricing , gross margin and costs , capital spending , depreciation , research and development expenses , potential impairment of investments , the tax rate , and pending legal proceedings . our future results of operations may also be affected by the amount , type , and valuation of share-based awards granted as well as the amount of awards cancelled due to employee turnover and the timing of award exercises by employees . we are focusing on efforts to improve operational efficiency and reduce spending that may result in several actions that could have an impact on expense levels and gross margin . in addition to the various important factors discussed above , a number of other important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations . see the risks described in Â “ risk factors Â ” in part Â   ii , item Â   1a of this form 10-q . for the second quarter of 2007 , we expect revenue to be between $ 8 . 2 Â   billion and $ 8 . 8 Â   billion , compared to first quarter revenue of $ 8 . 9 Â   billion . the midpoint of this range would be a sequential decrease of 4 % , which is consistent with seasonal patterns . our microprocessor business generally has followed a seasonal trend ; however , there can be no assurance that this trend will continue . historically , our sales of microprocessors have been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year . consumer purchases of pcs have been higher in the second half of the year , primarily due to back-to-school and holiday demand . in addition , technology purchases from businesses have tended to be higher in the second half of the year . our financial results are substantially dependent on sales of microprocessors . revenue is partly a function of the mix of types and performance capabilities of microprocessors sold , as well as the mix of chipsets , flash memory and other semiconductor products sold , all of which are difficult to forecast . because of the wide price differences among mobile , desktop , and server microprocessors , the mix of types and performance levels of microprocessors sold affects the average selling price that we will realize and has a large impact on our revenue and gross margin . revenue is affected by the timing of new intel product introductions and the demand for and market acceptance of our products ; actions taken by our competitors , including new product offerings , marketing programs and pricing pressures , and our response to such actions ; our ability to respond quickly to technological developments and to incorporate new features into our products ; and the availability of sufficient components from suppliers to meet demand . factors that could cause demand to be different from our expectations include customer acceptance of our products and our competitors products ; changes in customer order patterns , including order cancellations ; changes in the level of inventory at customers ; and changes in business and economic conditions . we expect the gross margin percentage in the second quarter of 2007 to be approximately 48 % , plus or minus a couple of points . the 48 % midpoint is lower than the gross margin of 50 . 1 % in the first quarter , primarily due to lower revenue , lower sell through of previously reserved products , and higher start-up costs related to our 45-nanometer process technology . we expect the decreases to our gross margin percentage to be partially offset by lower microprocessor unit costs and lower excess capacity charges . our gross margin expectation for 2007 is 51 % , plus or minus a couple of points , which is higher than previous expectations of 50 % primarily due to lower microprocessor unit costs and higher microprocessor average selling prices compared to previous expectations . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) our gross margin varies primarily with revenue levels . variability of other factors will also continue to affect cost of sales and the gross margin percentage , including product mix and pricing ; capacity utilization ; variations in inventory valuation ; excess or obsolete inventory ; manufacturing yields ; changes in unit costs ; impairment of long-lived assets , including manufacturing , assembly and test , and intangible assets ; and the timing and execution of the manufacturing ramp and associated costs , including start-up costs . we have continued to expand our semiconductor manufacturing and assembly and test capacity over the last few years , and we continue to plan capacity based on our overall strategy and the acceptance of our products in specific market segments . we currently expect that capital spending in 2007 will be approximately $ 5 . 5 Â   billion , plus or minus $ 200 Â   million . this capital-spending plan is dependent on expectations regarding production efficiencies and delivery times of various machinery and equipment , and construction schedules . if the demand for our products does not grow and continue to move toward higher performance products in the various market segments , revenue and gross margin would be harmed , manufacturing and assembly and test capacity would be underutilized , and the rate of capital spending could be reduced . we could be required to record an impairment of our manufacturing or assembly and test equipment and facilities , or factory-planning decisions may cause us to record accelerated depreciation . in addition , if demand for our products is reduced or we fail to accurately forecast demand , we could be required to write off inventory , which would have a negative impact on our gross margin . however , in the long term , revenue and gross margin may also be affected if we do not add capacity fast enough to meet market demand . we expect depreciation expense to be between $ 1 . 1 Â   billion and $ 1 . 2 Â   billion for the second quarter of 2007 and approximately $ 4 . 8 Â   billion , plus or minus $ 100 Â   million for the full year 2007 . spending on research and development , plus marketing , general and administrative expenses ( total spending ) in the second quarter of 2007 is expected to be between $ 2 . 6 Â   billion and $ 2 . 7 Â   billion and is approximately flat compared to $ 2 . 7 Â   billion in the first quarter of 2007 . research and development spending in 2007 is expected to be approximately $ 5 . 6 Â   billion , which is higher than our previous expectation of approximately $ 5 . 4 Â   billion . marketing , general and administrative expenses in 2007 are expected to be approximately $ 5 . 1 Â   billion , which is lower than our previous expectation of approximately $ 5 . 3 Â   billion . we continue to focus on controlling our total spending through cost-saving actions . restructuring charges related to employee severance and benefit arrangements in the second quarter of 2007 are expected to be approximately $ 60 Â   million . expenses , particularly certain marketing and compensation expenses vary depending on the level of demand for our products , the level of revenue and profit , and impairments of long-lived assets . we expect the net gains from equity investments and interest and other for the second quarter of 2007 to be approximately $ 150 Â   million . our expectations for gains ( losses ) Â   from equity investments include our expectations for mergers , stock offerings , and impairment charges on public and private equity investments , and are based on our experience . it is not possible to know at the present time whether specific investments are likely to be impaired or the extent or timing of individual impairments . in addition , our expectations for gains or losses from equity investments and interest and other could vary depending on equity market levels and volatility ; gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities ; gains or losses from equity method investments ; impairment charges related to marketable , non-marketable and other investments ; interest rates , cash balances , and changes in the fair value of derivative instruments . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) the tax rate for the second , third , and fourth quarters is expected to be approximately 31 % . the estimated effective tax rate is based on tax law in effect at march Â   31 , 2007 and current expected income . the tax rate may also be affected by the closing of acquisitions or divestitures ; the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed ; changes in estimates of credits , benefits , and deductions ; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities , including payment of interest and penalties ; and the ability to realize deferred tax assets . we believe that we have the product offerings , facilities , personnel , and competitive and financial resources for continued business success , but future revenue , costs , gross margin , and profits are all influenced by a number of factors , including those discussed above , all of which are inherently difficult to forecast . status of business outlook and scheduled business updatewe expect that our corporate representatives will , from time to time , meet privately with investors , investment analysts , the media and others , and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the business outlook section and elsewhere in this form 10-q , including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this form 10-q . at the same time , we will keep this form 10-q and our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site ( www . intc . com ) . the public can continue to rely on the business outlook published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered , unless we publish a notice stating otherwise . the statements in the business outlook and other forward-looking statements in this form 10-q are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and sec filings and at other times . from the close of business on june Â   1 , 2007 until our quarterly earnings release is published , presently scheduled for july Â   17 , 2007 , we will observe a Â “ quiet period . Â ” during the quiet period , the business outlook and other forward-looking statements first published in our form 8-k filed on april Â   17 , 2007 , as reiterated or updated as applicable , in our filings with the sec on forms 10-k and 10-q , should be considered historical , speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update . during the quiet period , our representatives will not comment on the business outlook or our financial results or expectations . the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period , and any others that we utilize , from time to time , may vary at our discretion .

< date > 2006-09-30 < / date > < price > 20 . 57 < / price > < company > intc < / company > we begin management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( md & a ) with a discussion on our use of non-gaap financial measures . we then discuss intel Â ’ s overall strategy and the strategy for our major operating segments to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the direction in which our business and products are moving . the strategy section is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results . we then discuss our results of operations , beginning with an Â “ overview . Â ” following the analysis of our results , we provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows , and discuss our financial condition in the section entitled Â “ liquidity and capital resources . Â ” we then conclude this md & a with our business outlook section , discussing our outlook for the fourth quarter and for 2006 . the various sections of this md & a contain a number of forward-looking statements . words such as Â “ expects , Â ” Â “ goals , Â ” Â “ plans , Â ” Â “ believes , Â ” Â “ continues , Â ” Â “ may , Â ” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements . in addition , any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance , our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses , and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements . such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in the Â “ business outlook Â ” section ( also see item Â   1a Â “ risk factors Â ” in part Â   ii of this form 10-q ) . our actual results may differ materially , and these forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures , mergers , acquisitions , or other business combinations that had not been completed as of november Â   1 , 2006 . non-gaap financial measuresin addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with united states ( u . s . ) generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ) , this md & a contains non-gaap financial measures that exclude the effects of share-based compensation and the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards ( sfas ) Â   no . Â   123 ( revised 2004 ) , Â “ share-based payment Â ” ( sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) ) . the non-gaap financial measures used by management and disclosed by the company exclude the income statement effects of all forms of share-based compensation and the effects of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) upon the number of diluted common shares used in calculating non-gaap diluted earnings per share . the non-gaap financial measures disclosed by the company should not be considered a substitute for , or superior to , financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap , and the financial results calculated in accordance with gaap and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated . the non-gaap financial measures used by the company may be calculated differently from , and therefore may not be comparable to , similarly titled measures used by other companies . the company has provided reconciliations of the non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures . the company applied the modified prospective method of adoption of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) , under which the effects of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) are reflected in the company Â ’ s gaap financial statement presentations for and after the first quarter 2006 , but are not reflected in results for prior periods . in managing the company Â ’ s business on a consolidated basis , consistent with how we managed our business prior to the adoption of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) , management develops an annual budget that includes all components of the income statement , exclusive of share-based compensation . gross margin , expenses ( research and development and marketing , general and administrative ) , operating income , income taxes , net income and diluted earnings per share ( eps ) Â   are the primary consolidated financial measures management uses for planning and forecasting future periods that are affected by share-based compensation . the company Â ’ s budget and planning process commences with a segment-level evaluation which excludes share-based compensation , and culminates with the preparation of a consolidated annual and / or quarterly budget that includes these non-gaap financial measures . this budget , once finalized and approved , serves as the basis for the allocation of resources and management of operations . the number of full-time equivalent employees working in manufacturing , research and development and marketing , general and administrative related roles is determined through the budgeting process exclusive of share-based compensation . segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation charges and therefore the budget and planning process , which involves headcount planning , excludes the effects of share-based compensation . in addition , our tax strategies are determined on a consolidated basis exclusive of the expenses and related tax benefit relating to share-based compensation . the accounting expense impact of share-based compensation is not discussed nor considered when assessing and determining the appropriate level of budgeted expenses for gross margin , research and development , and marketing , general and administrative expenses . accordingly , such Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) amounts are also excluded from the budgeted operating income , net income , and earnings per share . gaap-basis financial statements which include the effects of share-based compensation are only reviewed and analyzed for purposes of external reporting where gaap-basis financial statements are necessary . under our budget and planning process , consistent with our practice prior to the adoption of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) , when we seek to reduce unit costs with the goal of increasing gross margin , management does not consider the effects of share-based compensation . when assessing the level of research and development efforts currently or prospectively , consistent with our practice prior to the adoption of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) , management does not consider the effects of share-based compensation . when making decisions about project spending , administrative budgets , or marketing programs , management does not consider the effects of share-based compensation . in addition to using the budget process for planning and resource allocation , on a quarterly basis we analyze the performance of our business on a consolidated basis by comparing our gross margin , expenses ( research and development and marketing , general and administrative ) , operating income , net income , and diluted earnings per share , each excluding share-based compensation , to the prior period and forecasted amounts developed during the budget and planning process , also excluding share-based compensation . we use these quarterly assessments to evaluate the performance of the business against prior periods and budget and to develop our business outlook which we communicate to investors . consistent with our practice prior to the adoption of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) , the company Â ’ s share-based compensation programs are established and managed on a company-wide basis , including specification of grant types and amount ranges for employees by category and grade . our philosophy relative to share-based compensation programs is built on the principle that equity compensation should seek to align employees Â ’ actions and behaviors with stockholders Â ’ interest ; be market competitive ; be able to attract , motivate and retain the best employees ; and support intel Â ’ s belief in a broad-based approach . share based compensation granted to employees is in addition to , not in lieu of , cash compensation . accordingly , our share-based compensation programs are evaluated separately from the cost of our other compensation programs . specifically , our share-based compensation programs are carefully evaluated from the perspective of the resulting dilution and other metrics , and not from the resulting expense to be recorded . for example , our goal has been to keep the potential incremental dilution related to our equity incentive plans ( stock options and restricted stock units ) to a long-term average of less than 2 % annually . the dilution percentage is calculated using the new equity-based awards , net of equity-based awards cancelled due to employees leaving the company and expired stock options , divided by the total outstanding shares at the beginning of the year . further , as noted above , segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation charges , and these charges do not impact their business unit Â ’ s operating income ( loss ) . accordingly , share-based compensation charges also are excluded from the company Â ’ s measure of segment profitability ( operating income ) . therefore , when evaluating segment and operating income , management and the board of directors exclude share-based compensation . operating income and net income , both on a per-share basis , are calculated excluding share-based compensation for purposes of evaluating profit-dependent cash incentive compensation paid to employees , including senior management . for example , for 2006 , the executive compensation cash incentive plan formula measures eps as the greater of ( a ) Â   intel Â ’ s operating income or ( b ) Â   intel Â ’ s net income ( in both cases excluding the effect of share-based compensation ) , divided by intel Â ’ s weighted average diluted common shares outstanding , excluding the effects of share-based compensation . the calculation of diluted common shares outstanding , excluding the effects of share-based compensation , excludes the proceeds from the remaining unamortized share-based compensation , and adjusts the proceeds from tax benefits by excluding the effects of share-based compensation . the calculation of diluted common shares outstanding , excluding the effects of share-based compensation , is similar to the calculation of diluted common shares outstanding , as reported , prior to the adoption of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) . accordingly , when budgeting for the company Â ’ s profit-dependent cash incentives , the company applies the formula above to calculate earnings per share excluding share-based compensation so as to be able to factor the appropriate amount of profit dependent cash incentive into the budget . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) the company discloses this non-gaap information to the public to enable investors to more easily assess the company Â ’ s performance on the same basis applied by management and to ease comparison on both a gaap and non-gaap basis to our prior period results . in particular , as the company begins to apply sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) , the company believes that it is useful to investors to understand how the expenses and other adjustments associated with the application of sfas no . 123 ( r ) are being reflected on the company Â ’ s income statements . management believes gross margin , excluding share-based compensation , research and development , excluding share-based compensation , and marketing , general , and administrative expense , excluding share-based compensation , are useful information for investors because the gaap measure when compared in isolation with 2005 would indicate a level of increase in those expenses inconsistent with actual performance . we believe that the non-gaap measures serve to provide a baseline for investors in this first year of adoption to compare actual results for the current year , excluding share-based compensation , to the prior year gaap amounts , which exclude share-based compensation . we believe this comparison also is useful to allow investors to more easily evaluate our results from a period-to-period comparability perspective . management believes operating income and net income , excluding share-based compensation , is useful information to investors because it assists investors in evaluating operating income and net income consistent with how management evaluates performance and to understand the basis for the company Â ’ s profit dependent cash incentive plan . especially in this first year of applying the provisions of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) , we believe operating and net income as reported in our income statement are not comparable to prior year period amounts , and may lead investors to believe business has declined more significantly than would be caused by actual changes in the business ( as opposed to changes in accounting treatment between years ) . when presenting net income , excluding share-based compensation , we believe it appropriate to exclude the related tax benefit recognized in the financial statements for purposes of presenting net income or eps , excluding share-based compensation . providing diluted earnings per share , excluding share-based compensation assists investors in evaluating diluted earnings per share compared to prior periods . especially in this first year of applying the provisions of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) , we believe diluted earnings per share as reported in our income statement is not comparable to prior year amounts . the basis for the company Â ’ s decision to use these non-gaap measures excluding share-based compensation is that management has determined in this first year of adoption of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) to continue to evaluate the business on the same basis as prior to the adoption of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) until there is greater familiarity with its effects and until the second year after adoption of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) , when financial information is prepared and presented on a consistent basis with the prior year . share-based compensation represents : 1 . 2 points of gross margin , $ 107 Â   million of research and development expenses , $ 125 Â   million of marketing , general and administrative expenses , $ 335 Â   million reduction in total operating income , $ 248 Â   million reduction in total net income , and a $ 0 . 05 reduction in diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended september Â   30 , 2006 , compared to zero for all such measures in the quarter ended october Â   1 , 2005 . share-based compensation represents : 1 . 0 points of gross margin , $ 368 Â   million of research and development expenses , $ 418 million of marketing , general and administrative expenses , $ 1 . 0 Â   billion reduction in total operating income , $ 751 Â   million reduction in total net income , and a $ 0 . 13 reduction in diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2006 , compared to zero for all such measures for the nine months ended october Â   1 , 2005 . unlike other forms of compensation , share-based compensation was not recognized prior to january Â   1 , 2006 when we adopted the provisions of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) . additionally , when management determines the annual merit and promotional budget for compensation , the effects of share-based compensation on the company Â ’ s financial statements are not considered . rather share-based awards are generally granted via a fixed formula depending on position and level of the employee . in addition , segment managers are held accountable for other forms of compensation , and as such those compensation charges are included in the segments Â ’ results and in the budget and planning processes of our reporting segments . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) a material limitation associated with the use of these measures as compared to the related gaap measures is that they may reduce comparability with other companies who may use different types of equity incentive awards , or whose compensation structures may use share-based compensation to a greater or lesser extent as part of their overall compensation . these differences may cause our non-gaap measures excluding share-based compensation to not be comparable to other companies Â ’ non-gaap measures excluding share-based compensation . other material limitations associated with the use of these measures as compared to the gaap comparable measure include : gross margin , excluding share-based compensation , does not include all costs related to the cost of inventory sold during the period ; research and development , excluding share-based compensation , does not include all costs related to the research and development needed to bring new products to the market ; marketing , general and administrative expenses , excluding share-based compensation , does not include all costs related to the marketing , general and administrative efforts required to manage our company and sell our products . a material limitation with using operating income , excluding share-based compensation , net income , excluding share-based compensation , and diluted earnings per share , excluding share-based compensation , is that they do not include all costs typically included in the presentation of the comparable gaap measure , and they may not include all costs related to hiring and retaining qualified employees . although these non-gaap financial measures adjust cost , expenses , and diluted share items to exclude the accounting treatment of share-based compensation , they should not be viewed as a pro forma presentation reflecting the elimination of the underlying share-based compensation programs . thus , our non-gaap presentations are not intended to present , and should not be used , as a basis for assessing what our operating results might be if we were to eliminate our share-based compensation programs . our equity incentive plans are an important element of the company Â ’ s compensation structure and gaap indicates that all forms of share-based payments should be valued and included as appropriate in results of operations . because of the foregoing limitations , management does not intend to use the non-gaap financial measures when assessing the company Â ’ s performance against that of other companies . the company manages its share-based compensation programs in the aggregate against certain metrics rather than reviewing financial statement impacts by financial statement line item . specifically , our goal has been to keep the potential incremental dilution related to our equity incentive plans ( stock options and restricted stock units ) to a long-term average of less than 2 % annually . the dilution percentage is calculated using the new equity-based awards , net of equity-based awards cancelled due to employees leaving the company and expired stock options , divided by the total outstanding shares at the beginning of the year . strategyour goal is to be the preeminent provider of silicon chips and platform solutions to the worldwide digital economy . as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment , we use our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits , as well as our financial resources , global presence and brand recognition . our primary focus is on developing advanced integrated silicon technology solutions . our strategy focuses on taking customer needs into account in developing the next generation of products and platforms that will enable new form factors and new usage models for businesses and consumers . we believe that end users , original equipment manufacturers ( oems ) , third-party vendors , and service providers of computing and communications systems and devices want products based on platform solutions . we define a platform as a collection of technologies that are designed to work together to provide a better end-user solution than if the ingredients were used separately . our platforms consist of various products based on : standards and initiatives ; hardware and software that may include technologies such as hyper-threading technology ( ht technology ) , intel Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) we also believe that users of computing and communications systems and devices want improved overall performance and / or improved performance per watt . improved overall performance can include faster processing performance and / or other improved capabilities such as multithreading and / or multitasking , and improved connectivity , security , manageability , utilization , reliability , ease of use , and interoperability among devices . improved performance per watt involves balancing the addition of these types of improved performance factors with the power consumption of the platform . lower power consumption may reduce system heat output , provide power savings , and reduce the total cost of ownership for the end user . it is our goal to incorporate these improvements in our various products and platforms to meet end-user demands . in line with these efforts , we are focusing our efforts on multi-core microprocessors . multi-core microprocessors contain two or more processor cores , rather than just one processor core , which enable improved multitasking with improved performance per watt . in line with our efforts to improve overall performance , we will continue to invest in developing next-generation microarchitectures for microprocessors . the recent development of our new intel Â ® tmwe make equity investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives , including investments through our intel capital program . we generally focus on investing in companies and initiatives to stimulate growth in the digital economy , create new business opportunities for intel , and expand global markets for our products . the investments may support , among other things , intel product initiatives , emerging trends in the technology industry , or worldwide internet deployment . we invest in companies that develop software , hardware , or services supporting our technologies . our current investment focus areas include helping to enable mobile wireless devices , advance the digital home , enhance the digital enterprise , advance high-performance communications infrastructures , and develop the next generation of silicon production technologies . our focus areas tend to develop and change over time due to rapid advancements in technology . we plan to continue to cultivate new businesses and work with the computing , communications , and consumer electronics industries through standards bodies , trade associations , oems , original design manufacturers , and independent software and operating system vendors , to encourage the industry to offer products that take advantage of the latest market trends and usage models . these efforts include helping to expand the infrastructure for wireless connectivity , including wireless broadband . we also provide development tools and support to help software developers create software applications and operating systems that take advantage of our platform solutions . we frequently participate in industry initiatives designed to discuss and agree upon technical specifications and other aspects of technologies that could be adopted as standards by standards-setting organizations . in addition , we work collaboratively with other companies to protect digital content and the consumer . digital enterprise groupthe digital enterprise group ( deg ) Â   designs and delivers computing and communications platforms for

in the fourth quarter of 2006 , subject to customary closing conditions . intel and marvell entered into an agreement whereby intel will provide certain manufacturing and transition services to marvell for a limited time . see Â “ note 13 : divestitures Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) our strategy for notebook pcs is to deliver platforms with optimized performance , battery life , form factor , and wireless connectivity . for high-end mobility platforms , we offer the intel core 2 duo , the intel Â ® tm Â ® tm Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® we currently offer application and cellular baseband processors utilizing intel xscale technology . intel xscale technology provides processing and multimedia graphics capability for handheld devices . we currently offer application processors sold as discrete chips or in stacked packaging solutions ( stacking an application processor with memory ) . in august Â   2006 , we introduced a new version of the intel centrino duo mobile technology platform , based on the new intel core 2 duo mobile processors , the mobile intel Â ® Â ® in october Â   2006 , we introduced the intel Â ® Â ® flash memory groupthe strategy for the flash memory group is to provide advanced flash memory products for cellular phones , digital audio players , memory cards , and embedded form factors . we offer a broad range of memory densities , leading-edge packaging technology , and high-performance functionality . in support of our strategy , we offer nor flash memory products such as intel strataflash Â ® we offer a variety of stacked memory products , including products based on our nor flash , as well as our nor flash plus sram and / or nand flash , which we currently purchase from third-party vendors . stacking of memory products refers to packaging several memory chips together . in the second quarter of 2006 , we announced changes to the organizational structure within the flash memory group operating segment , designed to consolidate nor manufacturing , research and development and product support into the flash memory group . these organizational changes were designed to give the flash memory group more flexibility by giving it greater control over its own cost structure and allowing for better management of product development and manufacturing . these changes do not change the revenue or costs attributed to the flash memory group operating segment . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) in august Â   2006 , we introduced nor flash memory products designed for the emerging low-cost cell phone market . these products feature cost-efficient nor flash memory in densities ranging from 32mb to 256mb and optional ram in a multi-chip package . they are configured to work with low-cost , single-chip baseband and radio frequency solutions from leading chipset suppliers . in september Â   2006 , we began shipping intel Â ® digital home groupthe strategy for the digital home group is to design and deliver consumer products and platforms for pcs , digital tvs , and networked media devices that meet the demands of consumers for enjoyment of digital media and other content through a variety of connected digital devices within the home . we are focusing on the design of components for digital home living-room entertainment applications and pcs for the digital home . we offer intel Â ® tm Â ® tm Â ® digital health groupthe strategy for the digital health group is to target global business opportunities in healthcare research , diagnostics and productivity , as well as personal healthcare . in support of this strategy , the digital health group is focusing on healthcare information technologies , personal health products , and biomedical products . channel platforms groupthe strategy for the channel platforms group is to expand intel Â ’ s worldwide presence and success in global markets by growing both the broad channel as well as local oems . the channel platforms group tailors mainstream platforms to meet local market requirements , and develops and enables unique platform solutions for the needs of specific developing nations . critical accounting estimatesthe methods , estimates , and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements , which we discuss under the heading Â “ results of operations Â ” following this section of our md & a . some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments , often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain . our most critical accounting estimates include the valuation of non-marketable equity securities , which impacts net gains ( losses ) Â   on equity securities when we record impairments ; recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities , which impacts our tax provision ; assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets , which primarily impacts gross margin when we impair manufacturing assets or accelerate their depreciation ; valuation of inventory , which impacts gross margin ; and valuation and recognition of share-based compensation , which impacts gross margin , research and development expenses , and marketing , general and administrative expenses . below , we discuss these policies further , as well as the estimates and judgments involved . we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies , such as policies for revenue recognition , including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors ; however , these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) non-marketable equity securities . investments in non-marketable equity securities are inherently risky , and a number of these companies are likely to fail . their success is dependent on product development , market acceptance , operational efficiency , and other key business success factors . in addition , depending on their future prospects and market conditions , they may not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations , with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings , and the investments would likely become impaired . we review our investments quarterly for indicators of impairment ; however , for non-marketable equity securities , the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment . the indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances include ( a ) Â   the investee Â ’ s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects , ( b ) Â   the technological feasibility of the investee Â ’ s products and technologies , ( c ) Â   the general market conditions in the investee Â ’ s industry or geographic area , including adverse regulatory or economic changes , ( d ) Â   factors related to the investee Â ’ s ability to remain in business , such as the investee Â ’ s liquidity , debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash , and ( e ) Â   the investee Â ’ s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation . to assess indicators of impairment related to our investment in imft we generally apply the above indicators to our nand business versus only the investee . in particular , we evaluate the average selling prices of our nand products . investments identified as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired , in which case we write the investment down to its estimated fair value . when an investee is not considered viable from a financial or technological point of view , we write down the entire investment since we consider the estimated fair market value to be nominal . if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount or requires a new round of equity funding to stay in operation and the new funding does not appear imminent , we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired , unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise . with respect to our investment in imft , if indicators of impairment exist , we would determine the fair value of our nand business using the income method which is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses assumptions we believe marketplace participants would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows . our estimates are based on historical data , various internal estimates and a variety of external sources , and are developed as part of our routine long-range planning process . impairments of investments in our portfolio of non-marketable equity securities were $ 14 Â   million in the third quarter of 2006 and $ 47 Â   million in the first nine months of 2006 ( $ 20 Â   million in the third quarter of 2005 and $ 63 Â   million in the first nine months of 2005 ) . over the past twelve quarters , impairments of investments in our portfolio of non-marketable equity securities have ranged between $ 10 Â   million and $ 41 Â   million per quarter . income taxes . we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets . if recovery is not likely , we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable . we believe that a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be recovered . however , should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets , our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not probable . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) in addition , the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations . we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the u . s . and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether , and the extent to which , additional tax payments are probable . if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary , we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary . we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be . in june Â   2006 , the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) Â   issued fasb interpretation no . Â   48 ( fin 48 ) , Â “ accounting for uncertainty in income taxes Â – an interpretation of sfas no . Â   109 . Â ” the interpretation contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no . Â   109 . the provisions are effective beginning in the first quarter of 2007 . we are currently evaluating the impact fin 48 will have on our consolidated financial statements . see Â “ note 2 : recent accounting pronouncements Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q for further discussion . long-lived assets . impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows . due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity , we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings . in addition , as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions , we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets , primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements . when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated , and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the assets , we accelerate the rate of depreciation charges in order to fully depreciate the assets over their new shorter useful lives . impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets were less than $ 20 Â   million during the third quarter of 2006 and the first nine months of 2006 , and for the same periods during 2005 . over the past twelve quarters , impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets have ranged between $ 1 Â   million and $ 42 Â   million per quarter . inventory . share-based compensation . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock purchase plans at the date of grant requires judgment . we use the black-scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of these share-based awards consistent with the provisions of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) . option pricing models , including the black-scholes model , also require the use of input assumptions , including expected volatility , expected life , expected dividend rate , and expected risk-free rate of return . the assumptions for expected volatility and expected life are the two assumptions that significantly affect the grant date fair value . the expected dividend rate and expected risk-free rate of return are not significant to the calculation of fair value . we use implied volatility based on options freely traded in the open market as we believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility . in determining the appropriateness of implied volatility , we considered : the volume of market activity of freely traded options , and determined there was sufficient market activity ; the ability to reasonably match the input variables of options freely traded to those of options granted by the company , such as date of grant and the exercise price , and determined the input assumptions were comparable ; and the length of term of freely traded options used to derive implied volatility , which is generally 1 to 2 Â   years , and determined the length of term was sufficient . we use the simplified calculation of expected life described in the securities and exchange commission Â ’ s ( sec ) Â   staff accounting bulletin 107 , due to changes in the vesting terms and contractual life of current option grants compared to our historical grants . if we determined another method to estimate expected volatility or expected life was more reasonable than our current methods , or if another method for calculating these input assumptions was prescribed by authoritative guidance , the fair value calculated for share-based awards could change significantly . higher volatility and expected lives result in an increase to share-based compensation determined at the date of grant . the effect that changes in the volatility and the expected life would have on the weighted average fair value of grants and the increase in total fair value during the third quarter of 2006 and the first nine months of 2006 is as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   q32006 Â   Â   ytd 2006 Â   Â   Â   weighted Â   Â   increase in total Â   Â   weighted Â   Â   increase in total Â   Â   Â   average Â   Â   fair value1 Â   Â   average Â   Â   fair value1 Â   Â   Â   fair value Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   Â   fair value Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   as reported Â   $ 4 . 80 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   $ 5 . 14 Â   Â   Â   Â   hypothetical : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   increase expected volatility by 5 Â   percentage points2 Â   $ 5 . 37 Â   Â   $ 1 Â   Â   $ 5 . 83 Â   Â   $ 30increase expected life by 1 Â   year Â   $ 5 . 21 Â   Â   $ 1 Â   Â   $ 5 . 61 Â   Â   $ 20 Â   1 Â   amounts represent the hypothetical increase in the total fair value determined at the date of grant , which would be amortized over the vesting period , net of estimated forfeitures . Â   2 Â   for example , an increase from 32 % as reported volatility for q3 2006 to a hypothetical 37 % volatility . in addition , sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share-based awards which will be forfeited due to employee turnover . quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported share-based compensation , as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after january Â   1 , 2006 is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed . if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate , then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate , which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements . if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate , then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate , which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements . these adjustments affect our gross margin , research and development expenses , and marketing , general , administrative expenses . the effect of forfeiture adjustments in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2006 was insignificant . cumulative adjustments are only recorded to the extent the related expense is recognized in the financial statements , beginning with implementation in the first quarter of 2006 . therefore , we expect the potential impact from cumulative forfeiture adjustments to increase in future periods . the expense we recognize in future periods could also differ significantly from the current period and / or our forecasts due to adjustments in the assumed forfeiture rates . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) results of operationsoverviewin the third quarter of 2006 , revenue increased 9 % compared to the second quarter of 2006 , and declined 12 % from the third quarter of 2005 . the increase in revenue from the second quarter is primarily due to higher unit sales of microprocessors , chipsets , motherboards , and wireless connectivity products , partially offset by lower microprocessor average selling prices . our server business was an important part of the increased revenue , driven by strong demand for our new products . factoring in a lower revenue base in the second quarter of 2006 as our customers reduced their inventories , our third quarter revenue increase was approximately in line with seasonality . a substantial majority of our revenue and gross margin continues to be dependent on the sale of microprocessors and specifically , the continued growth of mobile microprocessors . our gross margin in the third quarter of 2006 was negatively affected by higher unit costs as we continue to ramp our dual-core microprocessors as well as higher write-offs for our mature products , in comparison to the second quarter of 2006 . higher unit costs have also contributed to the increase in our inventory dollars over the past year , however we believe that the inventory levels are appropriate for the business based on our current forecasts . operating results for the third quarter of 2006 included gains from divestitures and sale of investments as well as restructuring charges . we recognized $ 98 Â   million in restructuring charges in the third quarter of 2006 , which we estimate will result in gross annual savings of approximately $ 230 Â   million . we expect additional charges of approximately $ 125 Â   million in the fourth quarter of 2006 and $ 130 Â   million in 2007 , which we estimate will result in gross annual savings of approximately $ 800 Â   million . these restructuring charges relate to employee severance and benefit arrangements , however additional charges such as fixed asset impairments and other exit costs may be recognized as we continue to evaluate our business operations . in addition , we have taken actions to focus on our core businesses and have completed two divestitures in the third quarter of 2006 , with a third divestiture currently pending . overall , our ongoing program to improve operational efficiency and results is expected to generate cost savings of $ 2 Â   billion in 2007 , and $ 3 Â   billion in 2008 . a portion of these cost savings , such as better utilization of assets , reduced spending , and organizational efficiencies , will not result in restructuring charges . see the risks described in Â “ risk factors Â ” in part Â   ii , item Â   1a of this form 10-q . while the evaluation of our business has resulted in operational efficiencies , we have also positioned ourselves to maintain our lead and continue to grow our business given our technology and manufacturing leadership , leading-edge capacity , and portfolio of new products across our mobile , desktop and server businesses . driven by the ramp of our new core architecture , the majority of our microprocessors in the fourth quarter of 2006 are expected to be manufactured using our 65-nonometer process technology . we continue to focus on delivering next generation products and plan on introducing a new microarchitecture or shrinking the existing architecture every year . in line with this focus , we have recently announced that we will be shipping quad-core processors in the fourth quarter of 2006 and we expect to be the first to offer products based on 45-nanometer process technology . from a financial condition perspective we ended the third quarter of 2006 with $ 7 . 1 Â   billion in cash and short term investments and returned $ 500 Â   million to stockholders through stock repurchases and $ 577 Â   million as dividends in the third quarter of 2006 .

for q3 2006 was $ 8 . 7 Â   billion , a decrease of 12 % compared to q3 2005 . substantially all of the decrease was due to significantly lower microprocessor average selling prices . revenue in our asia-pacific region decreased 16 % , revenue in our europe region decreased 20 % , and revenue in our americas region and japan were approximately flat compared to q3 2005 . there were declines in q3 2006 compared to q3 2005 in both the mature and emerging markets , with the majority of the decrease in both markets occurring in the asia-pacific region . our overall gross margin dollars were $ 4 . 3 Â   billion in q3 2006 , a decrease of 28 % compared to $ 5 . 9 billion in q3 2005 . our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 49 . 1 % in q3 2006 , from 59 . 7 % in q3 2005 . the gross margin percentages for the digital enterprise group and the mobility group were lower in q3 2006 compared to q3 2005 . additionally , gross margin in q3 2006 includes the impact of share-based compensation . partially offsetting these decreases , the overall gross margin percentage was positively affected by a mix shift of our total revenue to the mobility group , which has a higher gross margin percentage . the q3 2005 gross margin was affected by a litigation settlement agreement with microunity , inc . in which we recorded a $ 140 Â   million charge to cost of sales , of which $ 110 Â   million was allocated to the digital enterprise group and $ 30 Â   million was allocated to the mobility group . the microunity charge reduced the q3 2005 gross margin percentage by 1 . 4 % . a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars and operating profit in q3 2006 and q3 2005 was derived from the sale of microprocessors . see Â “ business outlook Â ” later in this section for a discussion of gross margin expectations . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) digital enterprise groupthe revenue and operating income for the digital enterprise group operating segment for the third quarter of 2006 and 2005 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   q32006 Â   Â   q32005 Â   microprocessor revenue Â   $ 3 , 521 Â   Â   $ 4 , 936chipset , motherboard and other revenue Â   Â   1 , 425 Â   Â   Â   1 , 434 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   net revenue Â   $ 4 , 946 Â   Â   $ 6 , 370operating income Â   $ 858 Â   Â   $ 2 , 164 Â   net revenue for the digital enterprise group operating segment decreased significantly by $ 1 . 4 billion , or 22 % , in q3 2006 compared to q3 2005 . the decline in net revenue was due to a significant decline in microprocessor revenue , while chipset , motherboard , and other revenue was flat . the majority of the decrease in microprocessor revenue was due to significantly lower desktop average selling prices , and to a lesser extent , lower desktop microprocessor unit sales . microprocessors within the digital enterprise group include microprocessors designed for the desktop and enterprise computing market segments as well as embedded microprocessors . revenue from network processors , which are based on our intel xscale technology , is included in Â “ chipset , motherboard and other revenue Â ” above . operating income decreased significantly by $ 1 . 3 Â   billion , or 60 % , in q3 2006 compared to q3 2005 . a substantial majority of the decrease was due to lower microprocessor revenue . to a lesser extent , higher microprocessor and chipset unit costs were partially offset by approximately $ 170 Â   million of lower operating expenses . results in q3 2005 include the digital enterprise group Â ’ s portion of the charge relating to the settlement agreement with microunity . mobility groupthe revenue and operating income for the mobility group operating segment for the third quarter of 2006 and 2005 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   q32006 Â   Â   q32005 Â   microprocessor revenue Â   $ 2 , 239 Â   Â   $ 2 , 331chipset and other revenue Â   Â   809 Â   Â   Â   639 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   net revenue Â   $ 3 , 048 Â   Â   $ 2 , 970operating income Â   $ 1 , 260 Â   Â   $ 1 , 431 Â   net revenue for the mobility group operating segment increased slightly by $ 78 Â   million , or 3 % , in q3 2006 compared to q3 2005 . microprocessor revenue decreased slightly by $ 92 Â   million , or 4 % , in q3 2006 compared to q3 2005 due to lower average selling prices , partially offset by higher unit sales . the majority of the increase in chipset and other revenue was due to higher revenue from sales of chipsets , and to a lesser extent , higher revenue from sales of wireless connectivity products . revenue from applications processors , which are based on our intel xscale technology , is included in Â “ chipset and other revenue Â ” above . in the second quarter of 2006 , we entered into an agreement to sell certain assets of the business line that includes application and cellular baseband processors used in handheld devices . see Â “ note 13 : divestitures Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q . operating income decreased by $ 171 Â   million , or 12 % , in q3 2006 compared to q3 2005 . a majority of the decrease was due to higher unit costs as we ramped our dual core processors . operating expenses as a percentage of revenue within the mobility group increased slightly in q3 2006 compared to q3 2005 . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) flash memory groupthe revenue and operating loss for the flash memory group operating segment for the third quarter of 2006 and 2005 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   q32006 Â   Â   q32005 Â   net revenue Â   $ 507 Â   Â   $ 573 Â   operating loss Â   $ ( 116 ) Â   $ ( 30 ) net revenue for the flash memory group operating segment decreased by $ 66 Â   million , or 12 % , in q3 2006 compared to q3 2005 . the majority of the decrease in revenue was due to lower average selling prices , and to a lesser extent , lower unit sales . in 2006 , we began shipping nand flash memory products manufactured by imft . operating loss increased from $ 30 Â   million in q3 2005 to $ 116 Â   million in q3 2006 . the increase was due primarily to higher costs related to our new nand flash memory business . in addition , lower revenue was partially offset by lower unit costs . share-based compensationshare-based compensation totaled $ 335 Â   million in q3 2006 , compared to zero in q3 2005 . we adopted the modified prospective transition method under sfas no .

7 Â   billion in the first nine months of 2006 , a decrease of 10 % compared to the first nine months of 2005 . a substantial majority of the decrease was due to significantly lower microprocessor average selling prices . to a much lesser extent , lower microprocessor unit sales also contributed to the decrease . lower motherboard revenue was offset by higher chipset revenue . revenue in our asia-pacific region decreased 11 % , revenue in our europe region decreased 21 % , and revenue in our americas region decreased 4 % compared to the first nine months of 2005 . these decreases were partially offset by revenue in japan , which increased 4 % compared to the first nine months of 2005 . there were declines in the first nine months of 2006 compared to the first nine months of 2005 in both the mature and emerging markets . the decrease within mature markets occurred within the europe and asia-pacific regions and a substantial majority of the decrease within the emerging markets occurred within the europe and asia-pacific regions . our overall gross margin dollars decreased to $ 13 . 4 Â   billion for the first nine months of 2006 , a decrease of 20 % compared to $ 16 . 7 Â   billion for the first nine months of 2005 . our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 52 . 2 % for the first nine months of 2006 from 58 . 5 % for the first nine months of 2005 . the gross margin percentage for the digital enterprise group and the mobility group were both lower in the first nine months of 2006 compared to the first nine months of 2005 . partially offsetting these decreases , the overall gross margin percentage was positively affected by a mix shift of our total revenue to the mobility group , which has a higher gross margin percentage . a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars and operating profit in the first nine months of 2006 and the first nine months of 2005 was derived from the sale of microprocessors . see Â “ business outlook Â ”

Â   123 ( r ) , we accounted for our equity incentive plans under the intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles of apb 25 and related interpretations . accordingly , no share-based compensation , other than insignificant amounts of acquisition-related share-based compensation , was recognized in net income . as of september Â   30 , 2006 , there was $ 1 . 3 Â   billion of unrecognized share-based compensation costs related to stock options . the unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1 . 1 Â   years . in the second quarter of 2006 , we began issuing restricted stock units to employees . as of september Â   30 , 2006 , there was approximately $ 360 Â   million of unrecognized compensation costs related to restricted stock units . the unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock units is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1 . 8 Â   years . share-based compensation charges are included in the Â “ all other Â ” category for segment reporting purposes . operating expensesthe following tables present operating expenses and certain non-gaap measures , which exclude the effects of share-based compensation : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   ytd 2006 Â   Â   ytd 2005 Â   research and development Â   $ 4 , 447 Â   Â   $ 3 , 783share-based compensation charges in r & d Â   Â   368 Â   Â   Â   Â — Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   research and development , excluding share-based compensation Â   $ 4 , 079 Â   Â   $ 3 , 783 Â   marketing , general and administrative Â   $ 4 , 662 Â   Â   $ 4 , 082 Â   share-based compensation in mg & a Â   Â   418 Â   Â   Â   Â — Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   marketing , general and administrative , excluding share-based compensation Â   $ 4 , 244 Â   Â   $ 4 , 082 Â   Â   restructuring Â   $ 98 Â   Â   $ Â — Â   amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs Â   $ 37 Â   Â   $ 103 Â   Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) research and development . marketing , general and administrative . research and development along with marketing , general and administrative expenses were 35 % of net revenue in the first nine months of 2006 ( 27 % of net revenue in the first nine months of 2005 ) . restructuring . the following table summarizes the employee severance and benefit related restructuring activity : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   employee severance Â   ( in millions ) Â   and benefit Â   accrued restructuring balance as of july Â   1 , 2006 Â   $ Â — Â   additional accruals Â   Â   98 Â   adjustments Â   Â   Â — Â   cash payments Â   Â   ( 65 ) non-cash settlements Â   Â   Â — Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   accrued restructuring balance as of september Â   30 , 2006 Â   $ 33 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs . gains ( losses ) on equity securities , interest and other and taxesgains ( losses ) Â   on equity securities , net , interest and other , net and taxes for the first nine months of 2006 and 2005 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   ytd 2006 Â   Â   ytd 2005 Â   gains ( losses ) Â   on equity securities , net Â   $ 207 Â   Â   $ ( 20 ) interest and other , net Â   $ 570 Â   Â   $ 387 Â   provision for taxes Â   $ 1 , 398 Â   Â   $ 2 , 937 Â   net gains on equity securities and certain equity derivatives for the first nine months of 2006 were $ 207 Â   million . the net gain for the first nine months of 2006 included a gain of $ 103 Â   million on the sale of a portion of our investment in micron . other net gains on equity securities and certain equity derivatives during the first nine months of 2006 were $ 151 Â   million . these gains were partially offset by impairment charges of $ 47 Â   million for the first nine months of 2006 . during the first nine months of 2005 , net losses on equity securities and certain equity derivatives were $ 20 million , which included impairment charges of $ 168 Â   million . the impairment charge for the first nine months of 2005 was primarily due to a $ 105 Â   million impairment charge on our investment in micron . impairment charges were partially offset by other net gains on equity securities and certain equity derivatives of $ 148 Â   million for the first nine months of 2005 . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) interest and other , net increased to $ 570 Â   million in the first nine months of 2006 compared to $ 387 million in the first nine months of 2005 , reflecting a net gain of $ 129 Â   million for two completed divestitures ( see Â “ note 13 : divestitures Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q for further information on these divestitures ) and higher interest income as a result of higher rates , partially offset by lower cash balances . our effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2006 was 28 . 3 % , compared to 32 . 1 % for the first nine months of 2005 . the rate for the first nine months of 2005 included an increase to the tax provision of approximately $ 250 Â   million as a result of the decision to repatriate foreign earnings , which increased the rate for the first nine months of 2005 by approximately 3 points , which was partially offset by the reversal of previously accrued items . the rate for the first nine months of 2006 includes a higher percentage of profits in lower tax jurisdictions , which reduced the effective tax rate . partially offsetting the decrease in the effective tax rate was the impact of share-based compensation . the phasing out of the tax benefit for export sales did not have a significant impact on the effective tax rate compared to the prior year given the decrease in income before taxes . liquidity and capital resourcesour financial condition remains strong . cash , short-term investments , fixed income debt instruments included in trading assets , and debt at the end of each period were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   sept . 30 , Â   Â   dec . 31 , Â   ( dollars in millions ) Â   2006 Â   Â   2005 Â   cash , short-term investments and fixed income debt instruments included in trading assets Â   $ 7 , 800 Â   Â   $ 12 , 409 Â   short-term and long-term debt Â   $ 2 , 256 Â   Â   $ 2 , 419 Â   debt as % of stockholders Â ’ equity Â   Â   6 . 4 % Â   Â   6 . 7 % in summary , our cash flows were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   nine months ended Â   Â   Â   sept . 30 , Â   Â   oct . 1 , Â   ( in millions ) Â   2006 Â   Â   2005 Â   net cash provided by operating activities Â   $ 6 , 418 Â   Â   $ 11 , 094 Â   net cash used for investing activities Â   Â   ( 3 , 274 ) Â   Â   ( 2 , 790 ) net cash used for financing activities Â   Â   ( 5 , 999 ) Â   Â   ( 7 , 854 ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   net increase ( decrease ) Â   in cash and cash equivalents Â   $ ( 2 , 855 ) Â   $ 450 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   operating activitiescash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities . for the first nine months of 2006 compared to the first nine months of 2005 , the largest contributions to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was from lower net income ( including $ 1 . 0 Â   billion of share-based compensation ) , timing and changes in the amount of estimated tax payments , and higher inventories , partially offset by lower accounts receivable balances . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) inventories increased compared to december Â   2005 levels as we continue to ramp new products , primarily related to microprocessors on our 65-nanometer process technology , and associated chipsets on our 90-nanometer process technology . additionally accounts receivable decreased compared to december Â   31 , 2005 , primarily driven by lower revenue . for the first nine months of 2006 , our two largest customers accounted for approximately 35 % of net revenue , with one of these customers accounting for approximately 20 % of revenue and another customer accounting for approximately 15 % . for the first nine months of 2005 , these two largest customers accounted for approximately 36 % of net revenue . additionally , these two largest customers accounted for approximately 46 % of net accounts receivable at september Â   30 , 2006 ( approximately 42 % at december 31 , 2005 ) . investing activitiesinvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures , the proceeds from investment maturities and payment for investments acquired . the increase in cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of 2006 , compared to the first nine months of 2005 , was primarily due to our investments in imft and clearwire corporation . during the first nine months of 2006 , we paid $ 600 Â   million in cash for our equity investment in clearwire and $ 500 Â   million in cash for our equity investment in imft . in addition to the $ 500 Â   million paid in cash , our initial investment in imft of $ 1 . 2 Â   billion included the issuance of $ 581 Â   million in notes ( reflected as a financing activity ) and an additional $ 115 Â   million owed in cash , which has been reflected as a non-cash item on the statement of cash flows . net maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments were higher in the first nine months of 2006 compared to the first nine months of 2005 . in addition , during the first nine months of 2006 , we sold a portion of our investment in micron for $ 275 Â   million . capital spending increased to $ 4 . 7 Â   billion in the first nine months of 2006 compared to $ 4 . 5 Â   billion in the first nine months of 2005 , primarily driven by investments in 45-nanometer construction and 65-nanometer production equipment . other investing activities for the first nine months of 2006 included the purchase of intellectual property assets from micron , concurrent with the formation of imft , for $ 230 Â   million . also during the first nine months of 2006 , we received $ 152 Â   million for the sale of two completed divestitures . the effect of cash flows related to divested business units is not significant . financing activitiesfinancing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases and retirement of common stock and payment of dividends to stockholders . the lower cash used in financing activities in the first nine months of 2006 , compared to the first nine months of 2005 , was primarily due to lower repurchases and retirement of common stock . for the first nine months of 2006 , we purchased 219 . 4 Â   million shares of common stock for $ 4 . 4 Â   billion compared to 300 . 4 Â   million shares for $ 7 . 5 Â   billion in the first nine months of 2005 . our level of stock repurchases is based on internal cash management decisions and may fluctuate from quarter to quarter . at september Â   30 , 2006 , $ 17 . 4 Â   billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization . our dividend payments were $ 1 . 7 Â   billion in the first nine months of 2006 , higher than the $ 1 . 5 Â   billion paid in the same period of the prior year , due to an increase from $ 0 . 08 to $ 0 . 10 in cash dividends per common share effective for the first quarter of 2006 , partially offset by lower outstanding shares . additional financing activities for the first nine months of 2006 includes proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee equity incentive plans of $ 767 Â   million ( $ 1 . 1 Â   billion during the first nine months of 2005 ) and repayment of our non-interest bearing note to imft of $ 581 Â   million . liquidityduring the first nine months of 2006 , our level of cash declined as our cash provided by operations was less than our cash used for investing and financing activities . cash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity . another potential source of liquidity is authorized borrowings , including commercial paper of $ 3 . 0 Â   billion . there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program during the first nine months of 2006 . we also have a shelf registration on file with the security and exchange commission ( sec ) Â   pursuant to which we may offer an indeterminate amount of debt , equity and other securities . we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 Â   months , including capital expenditures for the expansion or upgrading of worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test capacity , working Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) capital requirements , the dividend program , potential stock repurchases and potential future acquisitions or strategic investments . during the fourth quarter of 2006 , the company plans to complete the sale of certain assets of its communications and application processor business to marvell technology group , ltd . for a purchase price of $ 600 Â   million . employee equity incentive plansour equity incentive plans are broad-based , long-term retention programs that are intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests . in may Â   2006 , stockholders approved the 2006 equity incentive plan ( the 2006 plan ) . the 2006 plan replaced the 2004 equity incentive plan , which was terminated early . under the 2006 plan , 175 Â   million shares of common stock were made available for issuance as equity awards to employees and non-employee directors through june Â   30 , 2008 , of which a maximum of 80 Â   million shares can be awarded as restricted stock or restricted stock units . additionally , in may Â   2006 , stockholders approved the 2006 stock purchase plan . under the 2006 stock purchase plan , 240 Â   million shares of common stock were made available for issuance through august Â   2011 . the 1976 stock participation plan and all remaining shares available for issuance were cancelled as of the plan Â ’ s expiration in august Â   2006 . our goal has been to keep the potential incremental dilution related to our equity incentive plans to a long-term average of less than 2 % annually . the dilution percentage is calculated using equity-based awards granted during the period , net of

Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) in accordance with a policy established by the compensation committee of the board of directors , total equity-based awards granted to the listed officers may not exceed 5 % of total equity-based awards granted in any year . for the first nine months of 2006 , equity-based awards granted to listed officers amounted to 1 . 9 % of the grants made to all employees . all equity-based awards granted to executive officers are determined by the compensation committee . all members of the compensation committee are independent directors , as defined in the applicable rules for issuers traded on the nasdaq stock market * . for additional information regarding equity incentive plans and the activity for the first nine months of 2006 and for 2005 , see Â “ note 3 : employee equity incentive plans Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q . information regarding our equity incentive plans should be read in conjunction with the information appearing under the heading Â “ report of the compensation committee on executive compensation Â ” in our 2006 proxy statement . business outlookour future results of operations and the other forward-looking statements contained in this form 10-q , including this md & a , involve a number of risks and uncertainties Â — in particular , the statements regarding our goals and strategies , new product introductions , plans to cultivate new businesses , future economic conditions , revenue , pricing , gross margin and costs , capital spending , depreciation , research and development expenses , potential impairment of investments , the tax rate , and pending tax and legal proceedings . our future results of operations may also be affected by the amount , type , and valuation of share-based awards granted as well as the amount of awards cancelled due to employees leaving the company and the timing of award exercises by employees . we are in the midst of a structure and efficiency review which is resulting in several actions that could have an impact on expense levels and gross margin . in addition to the various important factors discussed above , a number of other important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations . see the risks described in Â “ risk factors Â ” in part Â   ii , item Â   1a of this form 10-q . for the fourth quarter of 2006 , we expect revenue to be between $ 9 . 1 Â   billion and $ 9 . 7 Â   billion , compared to third quarter revenue of $ 8 . 7 Â   billion . the midpoint of this range would be a sequential increase of 8 % , which is consistent with seasonal patterns . our microprocessor business generally has followed a seasonal trend ; however , there can be no assurance that this trend will continue . historically , our sales of microprocessors have been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year . consumer purchases of pcs have been higher in the second half of the year , primarily due to back-to-school and holiday demand . in addition , technology purchases from businesses have tended to be higher in the second half of the year . our financial results , particularly our revenue , are substantially dependent on sales of microprocessors . revenue is partly a function of the mix of types and performance capabilities of microprocessors sold , as well as the mix of chipsets , flash memory and other semiconductor products sold , all of which are difficult to forecast . because of the wide price differences among mobile , desktop , and server microprocessors , the mix of types and performance levels of microprocessors sold affects the average selling price that we will realize and has a large impact on our revenue and gross margin . revenue is affected by the timing of new intel product introductions and the demand for and market acceptance of our products , as well as actions taken by our competitors , including new product offerings , marketing programs and pricing pressures and our reaction to such actions . microprocessor revenue is also dependent on the availability of other parts of the platform , including chipsets , motherboards , operating system software , and application software . revenue is also subject to demand fluctuations and the impact of economic conditions in various geographic regions . we expect the gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter of 2006 to be approximately 50 % , plus or minus a couple of points . excluding the effects of share-based compensation of approximately 1 % , our gross margin expectation for the fourth quarter of 2006 is 51 % plus or minus a couple of points . on a gaap basis , the 50 % midpoint is higher than the gross margin of 49 . 1 % in the third quarter . our expectation for gross margin in the fourth quarter is higher than the gross margin in the third quarter primarily due to expected higher unit sales , as we spread our fixed costs over more units , and slightly lower microprocessor unit costs . these increases to our gross margin percentage are expected to be partially offset by excess capacity charges on our 90-nanometer process technology capacity as we transition production to 65-nanometer , and higher startup costs on the new 45-nanometer process technology . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) our gross margin varies primarily with revenue levels . variability of other factors will also continue to affect cost of sales and the gross margin percentage , including product mix and pricing ; capacity utilization ; variations in inventory valuation , including variations related to the timing of qualifying products for sale ; excess or obsolete inventory ; manufacturing yields ; changes in unit costs ; impairment of long-lived assets , including manufacturing , assembly and test , and intangible assets ; and the timing and execution of the manufacturing ramp and associated costs , including start-up costs . we have continued to expand our semiconductor manufacturing and assembly and test capacity over the last few years , and we plan capacity based on our overall strategy and the acceptance of our products in specific market segments . we currently expect that capital spending in 2006 will be approximately $ 5 . 8 Â   billion , plus or minus $ 100 Â   million . this is below our previous expectation of $ 6 . 2 Â   billion , plus or minus $ 200 Â   million , primarily due to improved productivity and efficiency efforts . this capital-spending plan is dependent on expectations regarding production efficiencies and delivery times of various machinery and equipment , and construction schedules . if the demand for our products does not grow and continue to move toward higher performance products in the various market segments , revenue and gross margin would be adversely affected , manufacturing and / or assembly and test capacity would be under-utilized , and the rate of capital spending could be reduced . we could be required to record an impairment of our manufacturing or assembly and test equipment and / or facilities , or factory planning decisions may cause us to record accelerated depreciation . however , in the long term , revenue and gross margin may also be affected if we do not add capacity fast enough to meet market demand . in addition , if demand for our products is reduced or we fail to accurately forecast demand , we could be required to write down inventory , which would have a negative impact on our gross margin . we expect depreciation expense to be between $ 1 . 1 Â   billion and $ 1 . 2 Â   billion for the fourth quarter of 2006 . spending on research and development , plus marketing , general and administrative expenses ( total spending ) in the fourth quarter of 2006 is expected to be between $ 2 . 7 Â   billion and $ 2 . 8 Â   billion . excluding the effects of share-based compensation of approximately $ 250 Â   million , total spending in the fourth quarter is expected to be between $ 2 . 5 Â   billion and $ 2 . 6 Â   billion . on a gaap basis , the expectation for total spending in the fourth quarter is approximately flat or slightly lower than $ 2 . 8 Â   billion in the third quarter . we continue to focus on controlling our total spending through cost saving actions . expenses , particularly certain marketing and compensation expenses vary depending on the level of demand for our products and the level of revenue and profit . restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 2006 are expected to be approximately $ 125 Â   million , related to employee severance and benefit arrangements . research and development spending in 2006 is expected to be approximately $ 5 . 9 Â   billion . excluding the effects of share-based compensation of approximately $ 500 Â   million , spending for research and development in 2006 is expected to be approximately $ 5 . 4 Â   billion . on a gaap basis , the expectation for research and development spending in 2006 is below our previous expectation of approximately $ 6 . 0 Â   billion primarily due to cost saving actions as a result of our efficiency project . we expect the net gains from equity securities and interest and other for the fourth quarter of 2006 to be approximately $ 135 Â   million . our expectations for gains ( losses ) Â   from equity securities include our expectations for mergers , stock offerings , and impairment charges on public and private equity investments , and are based on our experience . it is not possible to know at the present time whether specific investments are likely to be impaired or the extent or timing of individual impairments . in addition , our expectations for gains or losses from equity securities and interest and other could vary depending on equity market levels and volatility , gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities ; impairment charges related to marketable , non-marketable and other investments ; interest rates , cash balances , and changes in the fair value of derivative instruments . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) the tax rate for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately 30 % . the estimated effective tax rate is based on tax law in effect at september Â   30 , 2006 and current expected income , and assumes that we will continue to receive the tax benefit for export sales . see Â “ note 18 : contingencies Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q . the tax rate may also be affected by the closing of acquisitions or divestitures ; the jurisdiction in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed ; changes in estimates of credits , benefits and deductions ; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities ; and the ability to realize deferred tax assets . we believe that we have the product offerings , facilities , personnel , and competitive and financial resources for continued business success , but future revenue , costs , gross margin , and profits are all influenced by a number of factors , including those discussed above , all of which are inherently difficult to forecast . status of business outlook and scheduled business updatewe expect that our corporate representatives will , from time to time , meet privately with investors , investment analysts , the media and others , and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the business outlook section and elsewhere in this form 10-q , including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this form 10-q . at the same time , we will keep this form 10-q and our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site ( www . intc . com ) . the public can continue to rely on the business outlook published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered , unless we publish a notice stating otherwise . the statements in the business outlook and other forward-looking statements in this form 10-q are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and sec filings and at other times . from the close of business on december Â   1 , 2006 until our quarterly earnings release is published , presently scheduled for january Â   16 , 2007 , we will observe a Â “ quiet period . Â ” during the quiet period , the business outlook and other forward-looking statements published in our forms 8-k filed on january Â   17 , 2006 , march Â   3 , 2006 , april Â   19 , 2006 , july Â   19 , 2006 , and october Â   17 , 2006 , as reiterated or updated as applicable , in our filings with the sec on forms 10-k and 10-q , should be considered historical , speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update . during the quiet period , our representatives will not comment on the business outlook or our financial results or expectations . the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period , and any others that we utilize , from time to time , may vary at our discretion .

< date > 2006-04-01 < / date > < price > 19 . 46 < / price > < company > intc < / company > we begin management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( md & a ) with intel Â ’ s overall strategy and the strategy for our major operating segments to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the direction in which our business and products are moving . the strategy section is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results . we then discuss our results of operations , beginning with an Â “ overview . Â ” following the analysis of our results , we provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows , and discuss our financial commitments in the section entitled Â “ financial condition . Â ” we then conclude this md & a with our business outlook section , discussing our outlook for 2006 and the second quarter of 2006 . the various sections of this md & a contain a number of forward-looking statements , all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in the Â “ business outlook Â ” section ( also see item 1a Â “ risk factors Â ” in part Â   ii of this form 10-q ) . our actual results may differ materially , and these forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures , mergers , acquisitions or other business combinations that had not been completed as of may Â   3 , 2006 . in addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with united states ( u . s . ) generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ) , the company Â ’ s results of operations and business outlook contains non-gaap financial measures that exclude the effects of share-based compensation and the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no . Â   123 ( revised 2004 ) , Â “ share-based payment Â ” ( Â “ sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) Â ” ) . the non-gaap financial measures used by management and disclosed by the company exclude the income statement effects of all forms of share-based compensation and the effects of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) upon the number of diluted shares used in calculating non-gaap earnings per share . the non-gaap financial measures disclosed by the company should not be considered a substitute for , or superior to , financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap , and the financial results calculated in accordance with gaap and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated . the non-gaap financial measures used by the company may be calculated differently from , and therefore may not be comparable to , similarly titled measures used by other companies . the company has provided reconciliations of the non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures . the company applied the modified prospective method of adoption of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) , under which the effects of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) are reflected in the company Â ’ s gaap financial statement presentations for and after the first quarter 2006 , but are not reflected in results for prior periods . gross margin , expenses ( research and development and marketing , general and administrative ) , operating income , income taxes , net income and earnings per share ( eps ) Â   are the primary financial measures management uses for planning and forecasting future periods that are affected by shared-based compensation . because management reviews these financial measures calculated without taking into account the effects of the new requirements under sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) , these financial measures are treated as Â “ non-gaap financial measures Â ” under securities and exchange commission ( sec ) Â   rules . management uses the non-gaap financial measures for internal managerial purposes , including as a means to compare period-to-period results on both a segment basis and consolidated basis and as a means to evaluate the company Â ’ s results on a consolidated basis compared to those of other companies . in addition , management uses certain of these measures when publicly providing forward-looking statements on expectations regarding future consolidated basis financial results . the company Â ’ s share-based compensation programs are established and managed on a company-wide basis , including specification of grant types and amount ranges for employees by category and grade . segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation charges impacting their business unit Â ’ s operating income ( loss ) Â   and accordingly , share-based compensation charges have been excluded from the company Â ’ s measure of segment profitability ( operating income ) . therefore , the review of segment results and forecasts by management and the board of directors excludes share-based compensation . 17 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) additionally , management and the board of directors will continue to compare the company Â ’ s historical consolidated results of operations ( revenue , gross margin , research and development , marketing , general and administrative expenses , operating income as well as net income and eps ) , excluding share-based compensation , to financial information prepared on the same basis during the company Â ’ s budget and planning process , to assess the business and to compare consolidated results to the objectives identified for the company . the company Â ’ s budget and planning process commences with a segment-level evaluation Â — which , as noted above , excludes share-based compensation Â — and culminates with the preparation of a consolidated annual and / or quarterly budget that includes these non-gaap financial measures ( gross margin , research and development expenses , marketing , general and administrative expenses , operating income , income tax expense , net income and eps ) . this budget , once finalized and approved , serves as the basis for allocation of resources and management of operations . while share-based compensation is a significant expense affecting the company Â ’ s results of operations , management excludes share-based compensation from the company Â ’ s consolidated budget and planning process to facilitate period to period comparisons and to assess changes in gross margin , net income and eps targets in relation to changes in forecast revenue . profit-dependent cash incentive compensation paid to employees , including senior management , also is calculated using formulae that incorporate the company Â ’ s annual results ( operating income and / or eps ) excluding share-based compensation . for example , for 2006 the executive compensation cash incentive plan formula measures eps as the greater of ( x ) Â   intel Â ’ s operating income or ( y ) Â   intel Â ’ s net income divided by intel Â ’ s weighted average diluted common shares outstanding , in both cases excluding the effects of share-based compensation . the company discloses this non-gaap information to the public to enable investors who wish to more easily assess the company Â ’ s performance on the same basis applied by management and to ease comparison on both a gaap and non-gaap basis among other companies that separately identify share-based compensation . in particular , as the company begins to apply sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) , the company believes that it is useful to investors to understand how the expenses and other adjustments associated with the application of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) are being reflected on the company Â ’ s income statements . although these non-gaap financial measures adjust cost , expenses and diluted share items to exclude the accounting treatment of share-based compensation , they should not be viewed as a pro forma presentation reflecting the elimination of the underlying share-based compensation programs , as those programs are an important element of the company Â ’ s compensation structure and generally accepted accounting principles indicate that all forms of share-based payments should be valued and included as appropriate in results of operations . management takes into consideration this aspect of the non-gaap financial measures by evaluating the dilutive effect of the company Â ’ s share-based compensation arrangements on the company Â ’ s basic and diluted earnings per share calculations and by reviewing other quantitative and qualitative information regarding the company Â ’ s share-based compensation arrangements , including the information provided in the results of operations section of this form 10-q under the caption Â “ employee equity incentive plans .

discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) critical accounting estimatesthe methods , estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements , which we discuss under the heading Â “ results of operations Â ” following this section of our md & a . some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments , often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain . our most critical accounting estimates include the valuation of non-marketable equity securities , which impacts net gains ( losses ) Â   on equity securities when we record impairments ; recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities , which impact our tax provision ; assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets , which primarily impacts gross margin when we impair manufacturing assets or accelerate their depreciation ; valuation of inventory , which impacts gross margin ; and valuation and recognition of share-based compensation , which impacts gross margin , research and development expenses , and marketing , general and administrative expenses . below , we discuss these policies further , as well as the estimates and judgments involved . we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies , such as policies for revenue recognition , including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors ; however , these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective . non-marketable equity securities . investments in non-marketable equity securities are inherently risky , and a number of these companies are likely to fail . their success ( or lack thereof ) is dependent on product development , market acceptance , operational efficiency and other key business success factors . in addition , depending on their future prospects , they may not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations , with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings , and the investments would likely become impaired . we review our investments quarterly for indicators of impairment ; however , for non-marketable equity securities , the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment . the indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances include ( a ) Â   the investee Â ’ s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects , ( b ) Â   the technological feasibility of the investee Â ’ s products and technologies , ( c ) Â   the general market conditions in the investee Â ’ s industry or geographic area , including adverse regulatory or economic changes , ( d ) Â   factors related to the investee Â ’ s ability to remain in business , such as the investee Â ’ s liquidity , debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash , and ( e ) Â   the investee Â ’ s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation . investments identified as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired , in which case we write the investment down to its estimated fair value . when an investee is not considered viable from a financial or technological point of view , we write down the entire investment since we consider the estimated fair market value to be nominal . if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount or requires a new round of equity funding to stay in operation and the new funding does not appear imminent , we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired , unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise . impairments of investments in our portfolio of non-marketable equity securities were $ 23 Â   million in the first quarter of 2006 ( $ 15 Â   million in the first quarter of 2005 ) . 22 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) income taxes . we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets . if recovery is not likely , we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable . we believe that a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be recovered . however , should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets , our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely . in addition , the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations . we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the u . s . and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether , and the extent to which , additional tax payments are probable . if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary , we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary . we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be . long-lived assets . impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows . due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity , we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings . in addition , as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions , we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets , primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements . when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated , and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the assets , we accelerate the rate of depreciation charges in order to fully depreciate the assets over their new shorter useful lives . impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets were less than $ 15 Â   million during the first quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of 2005 . inventory . 23 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) share-based compensation . determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of share-based awards at the date of grant requires judgment . we use the black-scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans , consistent with the provisions of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) . option pricing models , including the black-scholes model , also require the use of input assumptions , including expected volatility , expected life , expected dividend rate , and expected risk-free rate of return . we use implied volatility based on options freely traded in the open market as we believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility . in determining the appropriateness of implied volatility , we considered : the volume of market activity of freely traded options , and determined there was sufficient market activity ; the ability to reasonably match the input variables of options freely traded to those of options granted by the company , such as date of grant and the exercise price , and determined the input assumptions were comparable ; and the length of term of freely traded options used to derive implied volatility , which is generally 1 to 2 Â   years , and determined the length of term was sufficient . we use the simplified calculation of expected life described in the sec Â ’ s staff accounting bulletin 107 , due to changes in the vesting terms and contractual life of current option grants compared to our historical grants . if we determined another method to estimate expected volatility or expected life was more reasonable than our current methods , or if another method for calculating these input assumptions was prescribed by authoritative guidance , the fair value calculated for share-based awards could change significantly . higher volatility and expected lives result in a proportional increase to share-based compensation determined at the date of grant . the expected dividend rate and expected risk-free rate of return are not as significant to the calculation of fair value . in addition , sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share-based awards which will be forfeited due to employee turnover . quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported share-based compensation , as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after january Â   1 , 2006 is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed . if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate , then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate , which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements . if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate , then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate , which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements . these adjustments affect our gross margin , research and development expenses , and marketing , general , administrative expenses . the effect of forfeiture adjustments in the first quarter of 2006 was insignificant . the expense we recognize in future periods could also differ significantly from the current period and / or our forecasts due to adjustments in the assumed forfeiture rates . 24 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) results of operationsoverviewin the first quarter of 2006 , revenue declined 5 % compared to the first quarter of 2005 , and declined 12 % from the fourth quarter of 2005 . the decline from the fourth quarter was primarily due to lower unit sales of logic products . while we believe that the computing industry remains healthy overall , we believe that growth rates are slowing . we now believe that there has been a build-up of inventories at our customers over the last several quarters . in addition , customers are stocking a smaller supply of components inventory as they make room for new product generations . in total , we believe these factors have led to an excess of several million units at our customers . strong competition has also affected both our unit sales and the average selling price of our microprocessors and chipsets . gross margin dollars in the first quarter declined more significantly than revenue due primarily to the effects of lower revenue from sales of high-margin logic products . as we look ahead to the second quarter , our customers are likely to begin to reduce their components inventory , and our sales would be negatively affected . therefore , the first half of 2006 is a time to reset our business . we expect seasonal increases in revenue , with a corresponding increase in gross margin , in the second half . our objective is to develop improved products using our superior manufacturing capabilities , and our plans call for our factories to remain fully loaded . we believe that our upcoming dual core microprocessors based on our 65-nanometer manufacturing technology will give us leading energy efficient performance across the desktop , notebook , and 2-way server market segments . at the same time , we are working to cut spending , and have reduced the outlook for total spending for the year by one billion dollars . we are also undertaking a comprehensive analysis of our company with the goal of increasing our overall efficiency in 2007 and beyond . despite the focus on reducing spending , we plan to proceed with our next generation of processes and products , and are not delaying our plans for introducing products using our 45-nanometer process technology . from a financial condition perspective , we returned $ 3 . 5 Â   billion to stockholders through stock repurchases and dividends in the first quarter , but

billion , a decrease of 5 % compared to q1 2005 . this decrease was primarily due to lower microprocessor average selling prices and significantly lower motherboard unit sales , partially offset by higher chipset revenue . the first quarter of 2006 included 13 Â   weeks in contrast to the first quarter of 2005 that included 14 Â   weeks . revenue in our europe region decreased 19 % , our asia-pacific region Â ’ s revenue decreased 2 % and revenue in our americas region decreased 3 % compared to q1 2005 . these decreases were partially offset by revenue in japan , which increased 8 % to $ 1 . 0 Â   billion compared to q1 2005 . there were declines in q1 2006 compared to q1 2005 in the emerging markets of the americas and europe regions as well as the mature markets in the europe region . our overall gross margin dollars were $ 4 . 9 Â   billion in q1 2006 , a decrease of 12 % compared to $ 5 . 6 billion in q1 2005 . our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 55 . 3 % in q1 2006 , down from 59 . 3 % in q1 2005 . the gross margin percentage for the digital enterprise group and mobility group were lower in q1 2006 compared to q1 2005 . additionally , gross margin in q1 2006 includes the impact of share-based compensation . see Â “ business outlook Â ” for a discussion of gross margin expectations . 26 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) digital enterprise groupthe revenue and operating income for the digital enterprise group operating segment for the first quarter of 2006 and 2005 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   q12006 Â   Â   q12005 Â   microprocessor revenue Â   $ 3 , 892 Â   Â   $ 4 , 944 Â   chipset , motherboard and other revenue Â

enterprise group operating segment decreased $ 1 . 2 Â   billion , or 19 % , in q1 2006 compared to q1 2005 . the decrease in revenue was primarily due to lower desktop microprocessor unit sales , lower microprocessor average selling prices and significantly lower motherboard unit sales . microprocessors within the digital enterprise group include microprocessors designed for the desktop and enterprise computing market segments as well as embedded microprocessors . revenue from network processors , which are based on our intel xscale technology , is included in other revenue above . operating income decreased $ 1 . 0 Â   billion , or 42 % , in q1 2006 compared to q1 2005 . the significant decrease was primarily due to lower microprocessor revenue , the impact of increased write-downs of chipset inventory and higher operating expenses . these decreases were partially offset by approximately $ 190 Â   million of lower start-up costs in q1 2006 . mobility groupthe revenue and operating income for the mobility group operating segment for the first quarter of 2006 and 2005 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   q12006 Â   Â   q12005 Â   microprocessor revenue Â   $ 2 , 347 Â   Â   $ 1 , 917 Â   chipset and other revenue Â   Â   632 Â   Â   Â   517 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   net revenue Â   $ 2 , 979 Â   Â   $ 2 , 434 Â

primarily due to significantly higher revenue from sales of microprocessors , which increased $ 430 Â   million or 22 % , in q1 2006 compared to q1 2005 , reflecting the continued growth in the notebook market segment . the higher revenue from sales of microprocessors was due to significantly higher unit sales , partially offset by lower average selling prices . additionally , revenue from the sale of chipsets increased significantly in q1 2006 compared to q1 2005 , primarily due to the success of intel centrino mobile technology . revenue from applications processors , which are based on our intel xscale technology , is included in other revenue above . operating income increased slightly , by $ 24 Â   million or 2 % , in q1 2006 compared to q1 2005 . the increase in operating income was primarily due to higher revenue from sales of microprocessors , offset by higher operating expenses . operating expenses as a percentage of revenue within the mobility group increased in q1 2006 compared to q1 2005 . 27 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) flash memory groupthe revenue and operating loss for the flash memory group operating segment for the first quarter of 2006 and 2005 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   q12006 Â   Â   q12005 Â   net revenue Â   $ 544 Â   Â   $ 578 Â   operating loss Â   $ ( 104 ) Â   $ ( 32 ) net revenue for the flash memory group operating segment decreased by $ 34 Â   million , or 6 % , in q1 2006 compared to q1 2005 . this decrease was primarily due to lower average selling prices , partially offset by higher unit sales and higher royalty receipts . we began shipping nand flash memory products manufactured by imft in q1 2006 . operating loss increased from $ 32 Â   million in q1 2005 to $ 104 Â   million in q1 2006 . the increase was primarily due to lower revenue , higher operating expenses , and spending related to nand products , partially offset by lower unit costs . share-based compensationshare-based compensation totaled $ 374 Â   million in q1 2006 , compared to zero in q1 2005 . we adopted the modified prospective transition method under sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) , effective beginning in the first quarter 2006 . prior to adoption of sfas 123 ( r ) , we accounted for our equity incentive plans under the intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board ( apb ) Â   opinion no . Â   25 , Â “ accounting for stock issued to employees , Â ” and related interpretations . accordingly , no share-based compensation , other than insignificant amounts of acquisition-related share-based compensation , was recognized in net income . as of april Â   1 , 2006 , there was $ 1 . 8 Â   billion of total unrecognized share-based compensation costs . the unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1 . 1 Â   years . in the second quarter of 2006 we began issuing restricted stock units to employees . share-based compensation charges are included in the Â “ all other Â ” category for segment reporting purposes . operating expensesthe following tables present non-gaap operating expenses , which exclude the effects of

  amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs Â   $ 19 Â   Â   $ 38 Â   research and development spending increased $ 296 Â   million , or 23 % , in q1 2006 compared to q1 2005 . this increase was due to share-based compensation of $ 135 Â   million , higher development costs for next-generation process technology and higher headcount . marketing , general and administrative expenses increased $ 382 Â   million , or 30 % , in q1 2006 compared to q1 2005 due to share-based compensation of $ 153 Â   million , increased marketing spending and higher headcount . research and development along with marketing , general and administrative expenses were 35 . 9 % of net revenue in q1 2006 ( 26 . 8 % of net revenue in q1 2005 ) . amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs was $ 19 Â   million in q1 2006 compared to $ 38 Â   million in q1 2005 , as a portion of the intangibles related to prior acquisitions became fully amortized . 28 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) gains on equity securities , interest and other and taxesgains on equity securities , net , interest and other , net and taxes for the first quarter of 2006 and 2005 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   q12006 Â   Â   q12005 Â   gains on equity securities , net Â   $ 2 Â   Â   $ 4 Â   interest and other , net Â   $ 154 Â   Â   $ 115 Â   provision for taxes Â   $ 517 Â   Â   $ 973 Â   net gains on equity securities and certain equity derivatives for q1 2006 were $ 2 Â   million compared to $ 4 Â   million for q1 2005 . the decrease in q1 2006 was primarily due to higher impairment charges on investments of non-marketable equity securities ( $ 23 Â   million in q1 2006 and $ 15 Â   million in q1 2005 ) , partially offset by higher net gains on equity transactions . interest and other , net increased to $ 154 Â   million in q1 2006 compared to $ 115 Â   million in q1 2005 , reflecting higher interest income as a result of higher rates , partially offset by lower cash balances . our effective income tax rate was 27 . 6 % for q1 2006 , compared to 30 . 9 % for q1 2005 . the decrease in the effective tax rate for q1 2006 compared to q1 2005 was due to a higher percentage of profits in low tax jurisdictions and an increase in non-u . s . research and development tax credits , partially offset by a decrease in the tax benefit related to export sales and the impact of share-based compensation . financial conditionour financial condition remains strong . at april Â   1 , 2006 , cash , short-term investments and fixed income debt instruments included in trading assets totaled $ 8 . 7 Â   billion , down from $ 12 . 4 Â   billion at december Â   31 , 2005 . at april Â   1 , 2006 , total short-term and long-term debt was $ 2 . 3 Â   billion and represented approximately 6 . 6 % of stockholders Â ’ equity . at december Â   31 , 2005 , total debt was $ 2 . 4 billion and represented approximately 6 . 7 % of stockholders Â ’ equity . cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities . for the first quarter of 2006 , cash provided by operating activities was $ 2 . 1 Â   billion , compared to $ 3 . 8 Â   billion for the first quarter of 2005 . for the first quarter of 2006 , the largest contribution to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was from lower net income and the timing and changes in the amount of estimated tax payments . accrued compensation and benefits decreased compared to december Â   31 , 2005 , primarily due to payout of 2005 Â   year-end employee bonuses . inventories increased compared to december Â   2005 levels , as we continue to ramp new products , primarily related to microprocessors on the 65 nanometer process and associated chipsets . trading assets decreased compared to december Â   31 , 2005 , primarily due to maturities in excess of purchases . accounts receivable was approximately flat compared to december 31 , 2005 , despite decreased revenue , due to a higher proportion of sales occurring at the end of the first quarter of 2006 . for the first quarter of 2006 , our two largest customers accounted for approximately 37 % of net revenue , with one of these customers accounting for approximately 22 % of revenue and another customer accounting for approximately 15 % . for the first quarter of 2005 , our two largest customers accounted for approximately 33 % of net revenue . additionally , these two largest customers accounted for approximately 49 % of net accounts receivable at april Â   1 , 2006 ( approximately 42 % at december Â   31 , 2005 ) . 29 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures , the proceeds from investments maturities and payment for investments acquired . we used $ 2 . 3 Â   billion in net cash for investing activities for the first quarter of 2006 , compared to $ 331 Â   million during the first quarter of 2005 . the higher cash used in investing activities in the first quarter of 2006 , compared to the first quarter of 2005 , was primarily due to lower net maturities of available-for-sale investments as we shifted our portfolio of investments in debt securities to longer-term maturities . capital expenditures remained flat at $ 1 . 8 Â   billion for the first quarter of 2006 compared to the first quarter of 2005 . capital spending for 2006 is expected to be $ 6 . 6 Â   billion , plus or minus $ 200 million , primarily for investments in 45 nanometer construction and production equipment . during the first quarter of 2006 , we paid $ 500 Â   million in cash for our investment in imft . our initial contribution to imft also included $ 581 Â   million in notes and an additional $ 115 Â   million owed in cash , which has been reflected as a non-cash item on the statement of cash flows . other investing activities included intellectual property assets purchased from micron , concurrent with the formation of imft , for $ 230 Â   million . financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases and retirement of common stock and payment of dividends to stockholders . we used $ 3 . 2 Â   billion in net cash for financing activities in the first quarter of 2006 compared to $ 2 . 6 Â   billion in the first quarter of 2005 . the major financing use of cash was for the repurchase of shares as we purchased 138 . 5 Â   million shares of common stock for $ 2 . 9 billion ( 107 . 9 Â   million shares for $ 2 . 5 Â   billion in the first quarter of 2005 ) . at april Â   1 , 2006 , $ 18 . 9 Â   billion remained available for repurchase under existing repurchase authorizations . our dividend payments were $ 585 Â   million in the first quarter of 2006 , higher than the $ 497 Â   million paid in the same period of the prior year , due to an increase from $ 0 . 08 to $ 0 . 10 in cash dividends per common share effective for the first quarter of 2006 . financing sources of cash for the first quarter of 2006 were primarily $ 376 Â   million in proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee equity incentive plans ( $ 410 Â   million during the first quarter of 2005 ) . another potential source of liquidity is authorized borrowings , including commercial paper , of $ 3 . 0 billion . there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program during the first quarter of 2006 . we also have an automatic shelf registration on file with the sec pursuant to which we may offer an indeterminate amount of debt , equity and other securities . we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 Â   months , including capital expenditures for the expansion or upgrading of worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test capacity , working capital requirements , the dividend program , potential stock repurchases and potential future acquisitions or strategic investments . employee equity incentive plansour equity incentive programs are broad-based , long-term retention programs that are intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests . under the 2004 equity incentive plan ( the 2004 plan ) , as amended , 370 Â   million shares of common stock have been made available for issuance as equity awards to employees and non-employee directors . the 2004 plan expires on june Â   30 , 2007 . we are presently proposing a new equity incentive plan for stockholder vote at our may Â   2006 annual stockholders Â ’ meeting . if approved by the stockholders , this new equity incentive plan would replace the 2004 plan , which would be terminated early . the proposed plan would make 175 Â   million shares of common stock available for issuance as equity awards to employees and non-employee directors through june Â   30 , 2008 , of which a maximum of 80 Â   million shares can be awarded as restricted stock or restricted stock units . additionally , we are proposing a new stock purchase plan for stockholder vote . if approved by the stockholders , this new stock purchase plan would replace the 1976 stock purchase plan when it expires in august Â   2006 . the proposed plan would make 240 Â   million shares of common stock available for issuance through august Â   2011 . our goal has been to keep the potential incremental dilution related to our equity incentive programs to a long-term average of less than 2 % annually . the dilution percentage is calculated using the new option grants for the year , net of options cancelled due to employees leaving the company and expired options , divided by the total outstanding shares at the beginning of the year . 30 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of

Â   123 ( r ) , which was adopted as of the first quarter of 2006 . in accordance with a policy established by the compensation committee of the board of directors , total options granted to the listed officers may not exceed 5 % of total options granted in any year . for the first quarter of 2006 , there were no options granted to listed officers . all stock option grants to executive officers are determined by the compensation committee . all members of the compensation committee are independent directors , as defined in the applicable rules for issuers traded on the nasdaq stock market * . for additional information regarding equity incentive plans and the activity for the first quarter of 2006 and for 2005 , see Â “ note 3 : employee equity incentive plans Â ” in the notes to the consolidated condensed financial statements in this form 10-q . information regarding our equity incentive plans should be read in conjunction with the information appearing under the heading Â “ report of the compensation committee on executive compensation Â ” in our 2006 proxy statement . 31 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) business outlookour future results of operations and the other forward-looking statements contained in this form 10-q , including this md & a , involve a number of risks and uncertainties Â — in particular , the statements regarding our goals and strategies , new product introductions , plans to cultivate new businesses , future economic conditions , revenue , pricing , gross margin and costs , capital spending , depreciation and amortization , research and development expenses , potential impairment of investments , the tax rate , and pending tax and legal proceedings . our future results of operations may also be affected by the amount , type , and valuation of share-based awards granted as well as the amount of awards cancelled due to employee turnover and the timing of award exercises by employees . in addition to the various important factors discussed above , a number of other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations . see the risks described in Â “ risk factors Â ” in part Â   ii , item Â   1a of this form 10-q . revenue for 2006 is currently expected to be 3 % lower than 2005 revenue of $ 38 . 8 Â   billion . this is below our previous expectation of 6 % to 9 % higher than 2005 revenue , primarily due to lower than expected unit sales . for the second quarter of 2006 , we expect revenue to be between $ 8 . 0 Â   billion and $ 8 . 6 Â   billion , compared to first quarter revenue of $ 8 . 9 Â   billion . the midpoint of this range would be a sequential decrease of 7 % , which is lower than the typical seasonal trend for the second quarter , due to an expected decrease in microprocessor unit sales as customers work through their current component inventories . seasonal growth is expected in the second half of the year . our microprocessor business generally has followed a seasonal trend ; however , there can be no assurance that this trend will continue . historically , our sales of microprocessors have been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year . consumer purchases of pcs have been higher in the second half of the year , primarily due to back-to-school and holiday demand . in addition , technology purchases from businesses have tended to be higher in the second half of the year . our financial results , particularly our revenue , are substantially dependent on sales of microprocessors . revenue is partly a function of the mix of types and performance capabilities of microprocessors sold , as well as the mix of chipsets , flash memory and other semiconductor products sold , all of which are difficult to forecast . because of the wide price differences among mobile , desktop and server microprocessors , the mix of types and performance levels of microprocessors sold affects the average selling price that we will realize and has a large impact on our revenue and gross margin . microprocessor revenue is also dependent on the availability of other parts of the platform , including chipsets , motherboards , operating system software and application software . revenue is also subject to demand fluctuations and the impact of economic conditions in various geographic regions . our gross margin expectation for 2006 is 53 % , plus or minus a few points . excluding the effects of share-based compensation of approximately 1 % , our gross margin expectation for 2006 is 54 % , plus or minus a few points . this is below our previous expectation of 57 % , plus or minus a few points , primarily due to higher microprocessor unit costs and slightly lower microprocessor average selling prices , partially offset by lower manufacturing startup costs . we expect the gross margin percentage in the second quarter of 2006 to be approximately 49 % , plus or minus a couple of points . excluding the effects of share-based compensation of approximately 1 % , our gross margin expectation for the second quarter of 2006 is 50 % plus or minus a couple of points . on a gaap basis , the 49 % midpoint is lower than the gross margin of 55 . 3 % in the first quarter . the lower gross margin is primarily due to an expected shift in product mix from higher margin microprocessors to lower margin products . additionally , gross margin is expected to be affected by higher microprocessor unit costs as we continue to ramp production of dual-core products . our gross margin varies primarily with revenue levels . variability of other factors will also continue to affect cost of sales and the gross margin percentage , including variations in inventory valuation , such as variations related to the timing of qualifying products for sale ; unit costs and yield issues associated with production at our factories ; excess or obsolete inventory ; timing and execution of the production ramp and associated costs , including start-up costs ; manufacturing or assembly and test capacity utilization ; the reusability of factory equipment ; impairment of long-lived assets , including manufacturing , assembly and test , and intangible assets ; and the valuation of stock options and other equity awards , which affects the amount of share-based compensation included in cost of sales . 32 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) we have significantly expanded our semiconductor manufacturing and assembly and test capacity over the last few years , and we continue to plan capacity based on our overall strategy and the acceptance of our products in specific market segments . we currently expect that capital spending in 2006 will be approximately $ 6 . 6 Â   billion , plus or minus $ 200 Â   million . this capital-spending plan is dependent on expectations regarding production efficiencies and delivery times of various machinery and equipment , and construction schedules . if the demand for our products does not grow and continues to move toward higher performance products in the various market segments , revenue and gross margin would be adversely affected , manufacturing and / or assembly and test capacity would be under-utilized , and the rate of capital spending could be reduced . we could be required to record an impairment of our manufacturing or assembly and test equipment and / or facilities , or factory planning decisions may cause us to record accelerated depreciation . however , in the long term , revenue and gross margin may also be affected if we do not add capacity fast enough to meet market demand . we expect depreciation expense to be between $ 1 . 1 Â   billion and $ 1 . 2 Â   billion for the second quarter of 2006 and approximately $ 4 . 7 Â   billion , plus or minus $ 100 Â   million for the full year 2006 . spending on research and development , plus marketing , general and administrative expenses ( total spending ) in 2006 is expected to be approximately $ 12 . 1 Â   billion . excluding the effects of share-based compensation of approximately $ 1 . 1 Â   billion , total spending is expected to be approximately $ 11 . 0 Â   billion . this is below our previous expectation of $ 13 . 1 Â   billion on a gaap basis , primarily due to cost savings actions . total spending in the second quarter of 2006 is expected to be between $ 3 . 0 Â   billion and $ 3 . 1 Â   billion . excluding the effects of share-based compensation of approximately $ 300 Â   million , total spending in the second quarter is expected to be between $ 2 . 7 Â   billion and $ 2 . 8 Â   billion . on a gaap basis , the expectation for total spending in the second quarter is lower than $ 3 . 2 Â   billion in the first quarter . expenses , particularly certain marketing and compensation expenses , vary depending on the level of demand for our products and the level of revenue and profit . research and development spending in 2006 is expected to be approximately $ 6 . 1 Â   billion . excluding the effects of share-based compensation of approximately $ 500 Â   million , spending for research and development in 2006 is expected to be approximately $ 5 . 6 Â   billion . based on acquisitions completed through may Â   3 , 2006 , we expect amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs to be approximately $ 10 Â   million in the second quarter and $ 45 Â   million for the full year 2006 . we expect the net gains from equity securities and interest and other for the second quarter of 2006 to be approximately $ 175 Â   million . our expectations for gains ( losses ) Â   from equity securities include our expectations for impairment charges on public and private equity investments and are based on our experience . it is not possible to know at the present time whether specific investments are likely to be impaired or the extent or timing of individual impairments . in addition , our expectations for gains or losses from equity securities and interest and other could vary depending on equity market levels and volatility , gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities , interest rates , cash balances and changes in the fair value of derivative instruments . the tax rate for the second , third and fourth quarters is currently expected to be approximately 30 . 5 % . the estimated effective tax rate is based on tax law in effect at april Â   1 , 2006 and current expected income , and assumes that we will continue to receive the tax benefit for export sales . see Â “ note 15 : contingencies Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements . the tax rate may also be affected by the closing of acquisitions or divestitures ; the jurisdiction in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed ; changes in estimates of credits , benefits and deductions , including changes in the deductions related to share-based compensation ; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities ; and the ability to realize deferred tax assets . we believe that we have the product offerings , facilities , personnel , and competitive and financial resources for continued business success , but future revenue , costs , gross margin and profits are all influenced by a number of factors , including those discussed above , all of which are inherently difficult to forecast . 33 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) status of business outlook and scheduled business updatewe expect that our corporate representatives will , from time to time , meet privately with investors , investment analysts , the media and others , and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the business outlook section and elsewhere in this form 10-q , including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this form 10-q . at the same time , we will keep this form 10-q and our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site ( www . intc . com ) . the public can continue to rely on the business outlook published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered , unless we publish a notice stating otherwise . the statements in the business outlook and other forward-looking statements in this form 10-q are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and sec filings and at other times . from the close of business on june Â   2 , 2006 until our quarterly earnings release is published , presently scheduled for july Â   19 , 2006 , we will observe a Â “ quiet period . Â ” during the quiet period , the business outlook and other forward-looking statements published in our form 8-k filed on april 19 , 2006 , as reiterated or updated as applicable in our filings with the sec on forms 10-k and 10-q after that date , should be considered historical , speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update . as noted in our form 8-k on march Â   3 , 2006 , the business outlook and other forward looking statements in our forms 8-k filed on january Â   17 , 2006 and march 3 , 2006 and in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december Â   31 , 2005 should be considered historical , speaking as of dates prior to march Â   3 , 2006 only and not subject to update . during the quiet period , our representatives will not comment on the business outlook or our financial results or expectations . the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period , and any others that we utilize , from time to time , may vary at our discretion . 34 Â

< date > 2005-10-01 < / date > < price > 24 . 65 < / price > < company > intc < / company > we begin management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( md & a ) with intel Â ’ s overall strategy and the strategy for our major business units to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the direction in which our business and products are moving . the strategy section is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results . we then discuss our results of operations , beginning with an Â “ overview . Â ” we then provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows , in the section entitled Â “ financial condition . Â ” finally , we conclude this md & a with our Â “ business outlook Â ” section , discussing our outlook for the fourth quarter and for 2005 . the various sections of this md & a contain a number of forward-looking statements , all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in the Â “ business outlook Â ” section . our actual results may differ materially , and these forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any investments , divestitures , mergers , acquisitions or other business combinations that had not been completed as of october Â   28 , 2005 . strategyour goal is to be the preeminent provider of silicon chips and platform solutions to the worldwide digital economy . as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment , we use our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits , as well as our financial resources , global presence and brand recognition . our primary focus is on developing advanced integrated silicon technology solutions . our strategy focuses on taking customer needs into account in developing the next generations of products that will enable new form factors and new usage models for businesses and consumers . we believe that the end-users of computing and communications systems and devices want products based on platform solutions . we define a platform as a collection of technologies that better meet the requirements of end users . by combining technology ingredients to work together in a platform , we believe we provide a better end-user solution than if the ingredients were used separately . the success of our strategy to offer platform solutions is dependent on our ability to select and incorporate ingredients that customers value , and to market the platforms effectively . in developing our platforms , we may include ingredients sold by other companies . we also believe that users of computing and communications systems and devices want improved overall performance and / or improved performance per watt . improved overall performance can include faster processing performance as well as other improved capabilities such as multithreading and / or multitasking , seamless connectivity , improved security , manageability , reliability , ease of use and / or interoperability among devices . improved performance per watt involves balancing the addition of these types of improved performance factors in relation to the power consumption of the platform . lower power consumption provides power savings and may reduce the total cost of ownership for the end-user . it is our goal to incorporate these improvements in our various products and platforms to meet end-user demands . in line with these efforts we are focusing our efforts on dual-core microprocessors . dual-core microprocessors contain two processor cores , rather than just one microprocessor core , which enables improved multi-tasking with improved performance per watt . we make equity investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives , primarily through our intel capital program . this program generally focuses on investing in companies and initiatives to stimulate growth in the digital economy , create new business opportunities for intel and expand global markets for our products . the investments may support , among other things , intel product initiatives , emerging trends in the technology industry or worldwide internet deployment . we invest in companies that develop software , hardware or services supporting our technologies . our current investment focus areas include enabling mobile wireless devices , helping to advance the digital home , enhancing the digital enterprise , advancing high-performance communications infrastructures and developing the next generation of silicon production technologies . our focus areas tend to develop and change over time due to rapid advancements in technology . 15 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) we plan to continue to cultivate new businesses and work with the computing , communications and consumer electronics industries through standards bodies , trade associations , original equipment manufacturers , original design manufacturers , and independent software and operating system vendors , to align the industry to offer products that take advantage of the latest market trends and usage models . these efforts include helping to expand the infrastructure for wireless connectivity , including wireless broadband . we also provide development tools and support to help software developers create software applications and operating systems that take advantage of our platform solutions . all of our businesses operate in highly innovative environments characterized by continuing and rapid introduction of new products that offer improved performance at lower prices . worldwide , our competitors range in size from large established multinational companies with multiple product lines , to smaller companies and new entrants to the marketplace that compete in specialized market segments . with the continuing trend toward convergence in computing and communications products , product offerings will likely cross over multiple categories , offering us new opportunities , but also resulting in more competitors . competition tends to increase pricing pressure on our products , which may mean that we must offer our products at lower prices than we had anticipated , resulting in lower profits . in market segments where our competitors have established products and brand recognition , it may be difficult for us to compete against them . when we believe it is appropriate , we will take various steps , including introducing new products and discontinuing older products , reducing prices , and offering rebates and other incentives in order to increase acceptance of our latest products . during the first quarter of 2005 , we reorganized our business units to bring all major product groups in line with our strategy to design and deliver technology platforms . these new business units include the digital enterprise group , the mobility group , the digital home group , the digital health group and the channel platforms group . the digital home group , digital health group and channel platforms group operating segments are included within the Â “ all other Â ” category ( see Â “ note 16 : operating segment information Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements ) . the discussion below and the results of operations for our business units in this md & a are presented under the new organizational structure , and all prior period amounts have been adjusted retrospectively to conform to the new presentation . digital enterprise groupthe digital enterprise group business unit designs and delivers computing and communications platforms for end-to-end solutions for businesses and service providers . our products are incorporated into desktop computers , the infrastructure for the internet , and enterprise computing servers . our platforms for businesses are designed to increase employee productivity and reduce total cost of ownership . the digital enterprise group develops these platforms based on our processors , chipsets , board-level

microprocessors that are optimized for use in the desktop and server computing market segments , and products designed for the communications infrastructure , including network processors and embedded microprocessors . although the digital enterprise group Â ’ s strategic focus is on business platform solutions , the group Â ’ s products also include microprocessors marketed to the consumer desktop computing market segment . consumer desktop platforms that are designed and marketed specifically for the digital home are offered by the digital home group business unit . our strategy for the desktop computing market segment is to introduce platforms with improved performance per watt , tailored to the needs of different market segments using a tiered branding approach . for desktop performance platforms , we offer the intel Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® 16 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) our strategy for the enterprise computing market segment is to provide competitive price for performance in platforms that increase end-user value in the areas of power management , security , and manageability for entry-level to high-end servers and workstations . our intel Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® in october Â   2005 , we announced our first dual-core intel xeon processor . the new processor , which is designed for dual-processor servers , supports hyper-threading technology , runs at speeds of up to 2 . 80 ghz , features 2 mb of l2 cache and has intel extended memory 64 technology . for the communications infrastructure , we deliver products that are basic building blocks for modular communications platforms . these products include advanced programmable network processors , based on

computing devices , and cellular baseband chipsets . our strategy for notebook pcs is to deliver products optimized for the four mobility vectors : performance , battery life , form factor ( the physical size and shape of a device ) and wireless connectivity . for performance mobility users , we offer the intel Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® our strategy for our flash memory products is to offer a broad range of memory densities , leading-edge packaging technology and high-performance functionality . in support of this strategy , we offer nor flash memory products such as intel strataflash Â ® our application processors utilize intel xscale technology , which provides the processing and multimedia graphics capability for data-enabled mobile phones and pdas . we also offer these application processors in stacked packaging solutions ( stacking an application processor with memory ) . 17 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) digital home groupfor the digital home group business unit , our strategy is to design and deliver computing and communications oriented platforms that meet the demands of consumers as digital content becomes increasingly used with a variety of connected digital devices . we are focusing on components for digital home living room entertainment applications and pcs designed for the digital home . we offer microprocessors and chipsets for embedded consumer electronics designs , such as digital televisions , video recorders and set-top boxes . in august Â   2005 , we announced that we will launch intel Â ® digital health groupfor the digital health group business unit , our strategy is to design and deliver products and explore global business opportunities for our products in healthcare research , diagnostics and productivity , as well as personal healthcare . in support of this strategy , the digital health group is focusing on healthcare information technologies , personal health products and bio-medical products . channel platforms groupfor the channel platforms group business unit , our strategy is to expand on intel Â ’ s worldwide presence and success in global markets by accelerating channel growth . in support of this effort , the channel platforms group makes our products and platforms available to a broad worldwide network of third-party distributors , dealers , system integrators and solution providers . additionally , the channel platforms group focuses on developing unique platform solutions designed to meet local market needs . 18 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) critical accounting estimatesthe methods , estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements , which we discuss under the heading Â “ results of operations Â ” following this section of our md & a . some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments , often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain . our most critical accounting estimates include the valuation of non-marketable equity securities , which impacts net gains ( losses ) Â   on equity securities when we record impairments ; valuation of inventory , which impacts gross margin ; assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets , which primarily impacts gross margin when we impair manufacturing assets or accelerate their depreciation ; and recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities , which impact our tax provision . below , we discuss these policies further , as well as the estimates and judgments involved . we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies , such as policies for revenue recognition , including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors ; however , these policies do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective . non-marketable equity securities . investments in non-marketable equity securities are inherently risky and a number of these companies are likely to fail . their success ( or lack thereof ) is dependent on product development , market acceptance , operational efficiency and other key business success factors . in addition , depending on their future prospects , they may not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations , with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings , and the investments would likely become impaired . in the current equity market environment , while the availability of additional funding from venture capital sources has improved , the ability of these companies to take advantage of liquidity events , such as initial public offerings , mergers and private sales , remains uncertain . we review our investments quarterly for indicators of impairment ; however , for non-marketable equity securities , the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment . the indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances include ( a ) Â   the investee Â ’ s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects , ( b ) Â   the technological feasibility of the investee Â ’ s products and technologies , ( c ) Â   the general market conditions in the investee Â ’ s industry or geographic area , including adverse regulatory or economic changes , ( d ) Â   factors related to the investee Â ’ s ability to remain in business , such as the investee Â ’ s liquidity , debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash , and ( e ) Â   the investee Â ’ s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation . investments identified as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired , in which case we write the investment down to its impaired value . when an investee is not considered viable from a financial or technological point of view , we write down the entire investment since we consider the estimated fair market value to be nominal . if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount or requires a new round of equity funding to stay in operation and the new funding does not appear imminent , we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired , unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise . impairments of investments in our portfolio of non-marketable equity securities were $ 20 Â   million in the third quarter of 2005 and $ 63 Â   million in the first nine months of 2005 ( $ 30 Â   million in the third quarter of 2004 and $ 74 million in the first nine months of 2004 ) . 19 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) inventory . long-lived assets . impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows . due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity , we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings . in addition , as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions , we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets , primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements . when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated , and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the assets , we accelerate the rate of depreciation charges in order to fully depreciate the assets over their new shorter useful lives . income taxes . we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets . if recovery is not likely , we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable . we believe that a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be recovered . however , should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets , our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely . in addition , the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations . we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states ( u . s . ) and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether , and the extent to which , additional tax payments are probable . if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary , we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary . we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be . 20 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) results of operationsoverviewin the third quarter of 2005 , we continued to see growth and strong financial results , with revenue , gross margin dollars , and operating income each achieving double-digit growth from a year ago . this growth was led by a significant increase in unit shipments across all major product categories , including microprocessors , chipsets , flash memory , wireless connectivity , and application processors . we continue to be largely dependent on sales of our microprocessors , and this quarter microprocessors within the digital enterprise group and the mobility group accounted for approximately 73 % of our consolidated net revenue . three main influences continue to drive our business : emerging markets , demand for mobile platforms , and advances in manufacturing . we enter the fourth quarter of 2005 anticipating that we will continue to grow revenue and gross margin dollars . our factories are running at full capacity , and our unit costs continue to be better than our targets . however , our inventory levels are a little lower than we believe would be optimal , and we expect continued tightness in chipset inventory , particularly certain desktop chipsets . we will be working to increase inventory levels , and expect inventories to be higher at the end of the fourth quarter of 2005 , driven by the ramp of our dual-core , 65-nanometer processors . these processors are scheduled to begin shipping for desktop and mobile platforms at the end of the fourth quarter of 2005 , with introductions scheduled for the first quarter of 2006 . these platforms will enable new form factors and new usage models for businesses and consumers . during the first quarter of 2005 we announced a reorganization to align our business groups across our major platform initiatives . the discussion of our financial results below is consistent with these new business groups . results of operations Â — third quarter of 2005

process technology . in addition , the first nine months of 2005 included 40 Â   weeks in contrast to 39 Â   weeks for the first nine months of 2004 . marketing , general and administrative expenses were up $ 648 Â   million , or 19 % , in the first nine months of 2005 compared to the first nine months of 2004 , also primarily due to the higher marketing program spending and higher headcount as well as the extra workweek . research and development along with marketing , general and administrative expenses were 27 % of net revenue in the first nine months of 2005 and 28 % of net revenue in the first nine months of 2004 . amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs was $ 103 Â   million in the first nine months of 2005 compared to $ 141 Â   million in the first nine months

months of 2005 included impairments of $ 168 Â   million , primarily due to a $ 105 Â   million impairment charge on our investment in micron technology , inc . ( micron ) taken in the second quarter of 2005 . the impairment was principally based on our assessment of micron Â ’ s financial results and the competitive pricing environment for dynamic random access memory ( dram ) products . gains on equity transactions partially offset the impairments for the first nine months of 2005 . the net gain for the first nine months of 2004 was due to gains on

compared to $ 159 million in the first nine months of 2004 , reflecting higher interest income as a result of higher interest rates . our effective income tax rate was 32 . 1 % for the first nine months of 2005 , compared to 27 . 0 % for the first nine months of 2004 . the rate for the first nine months of 2005 included an increase to the tax provision of approximately $ 250 Â   million as a result of the decision to repatriate foreign earnings , which was partially offset by the reversal of previously accrued items . the rate for the first nine months of 2004 included a $ 195 Â   million reduction to the tax provision , primarily from additional benefits for export sales along with state tax benefits for divestitures , as well as the reversal of previously accrued taxes , primarily related to the closing of a state income tax audit . 27 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) financial conditionour financial condition remains strong . at october Â   1 , 2005 , cash , short-term investments and fixed income debt instruments included in trading assets totaled $ 13 . 6 Â   billion , down from $ 16 . 8 Â   billion at december Â   25 , 2004 . at october Â   1 , 2005 , total short-term and long-term debt was $ 684 Â   million and represented 2 % of stockholders Â ’ equity . at december Â   25 , 2004 , total short-term and long-term debt was $ 904 Â   million and also represented 2 % of stockholders Â ’ equity . cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain asset and liability balances . for the first nine months of 2005 , cash provided by operating activities was $ 11 . 1 Â   billion , compared to $ 9 . 0 Â   billion for the first nine months of 2004 . for the first nine months of 2005 , the largest contributors to the increase in cash provided by operating activities were from maturities of trading assets in excess of purchases , and higher net income . income taxes payable increased compared to december Â   25 , 2004 due to the timing of estimated payments and the impact of repatriation under the jobs act . accounts payable increased primarily due to the increase in capital expenditures and the timing of payments . accounts receivable increased compared to december Â   2004 due to a higher proportion of sales occurring at the end of the third quarter of 2005 . additionally , the fourth quarter of 2004 included higher cash receipts . for the first nine months of 2005 , our two largest customers accounted for 36 % of net revenue , with one of these customers accounting for 20 % of revenue and the other customer accounting for 16 % . for the first nine months of 2004 , our two largest customers accounted for 34 % of net revenue . additionally , these two largest customers accounted for 41 % of net accounts receivable at october 1 , 2005 ( 34 % at december Â   25 , 2004 ) . investing cash flows consisted primarily of capital expenditures and the proceeds of investments sold and payment for investments acquired . we used $ 2 . 8 Â   billion in net cash for investing activities for the first nine months of 2005 , compared to $ 5 . 0 Â   billion during the first nine months of 2004 . the lower cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of 2005 resulted from higher net maturities of available-for-sale investments due to a shift in our portfolio of investments in debt securities to shorter-term maturities in order to fund working capital and other investing and financing activities . capital expenditures increased to $ 4 . 5 Â   billion in the first nine months of 2005 from $ 2 . 8 Â   billion in the first nine months of 2004 , primarily driven by investments in 65-nanometer production equipment . financing cash flows consisted primarily of repurchases and retirement of common stock and payment of dividends to stockholders . we used $ 7 . 9 Â   billion in net cash for financing activities in the first nine months of 2005 compared to $ 5 . 5 Â   billion in the first nine months of 2004 . the major financing use of cash was for the repurchase of shares as we purchased 300 . 4 Â   million shares of common stock for $ 7 . 5 Â   billion ( 211 . 5 Â   million shares for $ 5 . 5 Â   billion in the first nine months of 2004 ) . at october Â   1 , 2005 , 313 . 1 Â   million shares remained available for repurchase under existing repurchase authorizations . our dividend payments were $ 1 . 5 Â   billion in the first nine months of 2005 , higher than the $ 770 Â   million paid in the first nine months of 2004 , due to an increase from $ 0 . 04 to $ 0 . 08 in cash dividends per common share beginning in the first quarter of 2005 . financing sources of cash for the first nine months of 2005 were primarily $ 1 . 1 Â   billion in proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee equity incentive plans ( $ 793 Â   million during the first nine months of 2004 ) . another potential source of liquidity is authorized borrowings , including commercial paper , of $ 3 . 0 billion . maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during the first nine months of 2005 were $ 150 Â   million , although no commercial paper was outstanding at the end of the period . we also maintain the ability to issue an aggregate of approximately $ 1 . 4 Â   billion in debt , equity and other securities under u . s . securities and exchange commission ( sec ) Â   shelf registration statements . we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 Â   months , including capital expenditures for the expansion or upgrading of worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test capacity , working capital requirements , the dividend program , potential stock repurchases and potential future acquisitions or strategic investments . 28 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) employee equity incentive plansour stock option program is a broad-based , long-term retention program that is intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests . under the 2004 equity incentive plan ( the 2004 plan ) , 240 Â   million shares of common stock were made available for issuance during the two year period ending june Â   30 , 2006 . in may Â   2005 , we obtained stockholder approval to extend the term of the 2004 plan by one year , to june Â   30 , 2007 , and to make an additional 130 million shares of common stock available for issuance as equity awards to employees and non-employee directors . we have a goal to keep the potential incremental dilution

. Â   2 Â   consists of shares available under our 1997 stock option plan , which was not required to be approved by stockholders . the 1997 stock option plan was terminated as to future grants when the 2004 equity incentive plan was approved by the stockholders in may Â   2004 . Â   3 Â   total excludes 5 . 3 Â   million shares issuable under outstanding options , with a weighted average exercise price of $ 15 . 78 , originally granted under plans we assumed in connection with acquisitions . 31 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) business outlookthe statements below do not include any impact related to the expensing of stock options according to statement of financial accounting standards ( sfas ) Â   no . Â   123 ( revised 2004 ) , Â “ share-based payment . Â ” if we had applied sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) to our results for the quarter ended october Â   1 , 2005 , our net income would have been lower by approximately $ 291 Â   million . the expensing of stock options would lower gross margin , would increase operating expenses , which include r & d expenses and marketing , general and administrative expenses , and would affect our tax rate . we expect to begin recognizing the effects of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) in our financial statements beginning in the first quarter of 2006 . see Â “ note 3 : employee equity incentive plans Â ” in the notes to the consolidated condensed financial statements in this quarterly report for more information regarding stock option expenses . for the fourth quarter of 2005 , we expect revenue to be between $ 10 . 2 Â   billion and $ 10 . 8 Â   billion , compared to third quarter revenue of $ 9 . 96 Â   billion . the midpoint of this range would be a sequential increase of 5 % , which is slightly lower than the typical seasonal trend for the fourth quarter . however , the midpoint would result in a seasonal second half , increasing 10 % from the first half , in line with the growth rate for the second half during the past 5 Â   years . our microprocessor business generally has followed a seasonal trend ; however , there can be no assurance that this trend will continue . historically , our sales of microprocessors have been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year . consumer purchases of pcs have been higher in the second half of the year , primarily due to back-to-school and holiday demand . in addition , technology purchases from businesses have tended to be higher in the second half of the year . our financial results are substantially dependent on sales of microprocessors . revenue is partly a function of the mix of types and performance capabilities of microprocessors sold , as well as the mix of chipsets , flash memory and other semiconductor products sold , all of which are difficult to forecast . because of the wide price differences among mobile , desktop and server microprocessors , the mix of types and performance levels of microprocessors sold affects the average selling price that we will realize and has a large impact on our revenue and gross margin . microprocessor revenue is also dependent on the availability of other parts of the platform , including chipsets , motherboards , operating system software and application software . revenue is also subject to the impact of economic conditions in various geographic regions . we expect the gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter of 2005 to be approximately 63 % , plus or minus a couple of points , higher than the gross margin of 59 . 7 % in the third quarter . the higher gross margin is due to the qualification of our dual-core , 65-nanometer products for sale , as well as higher revenue as we spread our fixed costs over more units . in addition , the third quarter included a $ 140 Â   million charge to cost of sales related to a settlement agreement with microunity . our gross margin varies primarily with revenue levels , which are dependent on unit volumes and prices , as well as the mix of types and performance capabilities of microprocessors sold , and the mix of chipsets , flash memory and other semiconductor products sold . variability of other factors will also continue to affect cost of sales and the gross margin percentage , including variations in inventory valuation , such as variations related to the timing of qualifying products for sale , unit costs and yield issues associated with production at our factories , excess or obsolete inventory , timing and execution of the production ramp , manufacturing or assembly and test capacity utilization , the reusability of factory equipment , and impairment of long-lived assets , including manufacturing , assembly / test and intangible assets . we have significantly expanded our semiconductor manufacturing and assembly and test capacity over the last few years , and we continue to plan capacity based on the assumed continued success of our overall strategy and the acceptance of our products in specific market segments . we currently expect that capital spending for 2005 will be approximately $ 5 . 9 Â   billion , plus or minus $ 200 million . this capital-spending plan is dependent on expectations regarding production efficiencies and delivery times of various machinery and equipment , and construction schedules . if the demand for our products does not grow and continue to move toward higher performance products in the various market segments , revenue and gross margin would be adversely affected , manufacturing and / or assembly and test capacity would be under-utilized , and the rate of capital spending could be reduced . we could be required to record an impairment of our manufacturing or assembly and test equipment and / or facilities , or factory planning decisions may cause us to record accelerated depreciation . however , in the long term , revenue and gross margin could be affected if we do not add capacity fast enough to meet market demand . 32 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) we expect depreciation expense to be between $ 1 . 0 Â   billion and $ 1 . 1 Â   billion for the fourth quarter of 2005 . spending on research and development , plus marketing , general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2005 is expected to be approximately $ 3 . 0 Â   billion , higher than $ 2 . 8 Â   billion in the third quarter of 2005 primarily driven by higher revenue and higher profit-dependent compensation expenses , as well as increased spending under seasonal marketing programs . expenses , particularly certain marketing and compensation-related expenses , may vary from this expectation , depending in part on the level of revenue and profits , among other factors . research and development spending is expected to be approximately $ 5 . 2 Â   billion in 2005 . based on acquisitions completed through october Â   28 , 2005 , we expect amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs to be approximately $ 20 Â   million in the fourth quarter of 2005 . we review our acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of potential impairment exist . we expect the net gains from equity securities and interest and other for the fourth quarter of 2005 to be approximately $ 130 Â   million . our expectations for gains ( losses ) Â   from equity securities include our expectations for impairment charges on public and private equity investments and are based on our experience . it is not possible to know at the present time whether specific investments are likely to be impaired or the extent or timing of individual impairments . in addition , our expectations for gains or losses from equity securities and interest and other could vary depending on equity market levels and volatility , gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities , interest rates , cash balances and changes in the fair value of derivative instruments . at october Â   1 , 2005 , we held non-marketable equity securities with a carrying value of $ 526 Â   million . a number of these companies are likely to fail . their success ( or lack thereof ) is dependent upon product development , market acceptance , operational efficiency and other key business success factors . in addition , depending on their future prospects , they may not be able to raise additional financings when needed , or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings , and our investments would likely become impaired . however , we are not able to determine at the present time which specific investments are likely to be impaired in the future , or the extent or timing of individual impairments . the tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2005 is expected to be approximately 31 % . the estimated effective tax rate is based on current tax law and current expected income , and assumes we will continue to receive the tax benefit for export sales ( see Â “ note 15 : contingencies Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements ) . the tax rate may be affected by the closing of acquisitions or divestitures ; the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed ; changes in estimates of credits , benefits and deductions , as well as the taxes associated with repatriation of cash under the jobs act ; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities ; and the ability to realize deferred tax assets . we are currently a party to various legal proceedings and claims , including legal proceedings and claims related to taxes and to allegations of antitrust violations and patent infringement . management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position , cash flows or overall trends in results of operations . however , litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties , and unfavorable rulings could occur . an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages , invalidation of a patent or group of patents , additional taxes owed or , in cases where injunctive relief is sought , an injunction prohibiting intel from selling one or more products . if an unfavorable ruling were to occur in any specific period , there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations of that period or future periods . management believes that , given our current liquidity and cash and investment balances , even an adverse judgment would not have a material impact on cash and investments or liquidity . 33 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) we operate globally , with sales , marketing and research and development activities as well as manufacturing and assembly and test facilities in many countries , and , as a result , we are subject to risks and factors associated with doing business outside the u . s . global operations involve inherent risks that include currency controls and fluctuations , tariff and import regulations , and regulatory requirements that may limit our or our customers Â ’ ability to manufacture , assemble and test , design , develop or sell products in particular countries . if terrorist activity , armed conflict , civil or military unrest , or political instability occurs in the u . s . , israel or other locations , such events may disrupt manufacturing , assembly and test , logistics , security and communications , and could also result in reduced demand for our products . the impacts of major health concerns or possible infrastructure disruptions , such as large-scale outages or interruptions of service from utilities or telecommunications providers , on intel , its suppliers , customers or other third parties could also adversely affect our business and impact customer order patterns . business continuity could also be affected if labor issues disrupt our transportation arrangements or those of our customers or suppliers . in addition , we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers , or upon suppliers in a single country . business disruptions at a supplier Â ’ s premises , such as damage to premises from fires or floods , may adversely impact our business and the impact may be greater in situations where we rely on a single or limited number of suppliers . on a worldwide basis , we regularly review our key infrastructure , systems , services and suppliers , both internally and externally , to seek to identify significant vulnerabilities as well as areas of potential business impact if a disruptive event were to occur . once identified , we assess the risks , and when we consider it to be appropriate , we initiate actions intended to reduce the risks and their potential impact . however , there can be no assurance that we have identified all significant risks or that we can mitigate all identified risks with reasonable effort . our future results of operations and the other forward-looking statements contained in this form 10-q , including this md & a , involve a number of risks and uncertainties Â — in particular , the statements regarding our goals and strategies , new product introductions , plans to cultivate new businesses , future economic conditions , revenue , pricing , gross margin and costs , capital spending , depreciation and amortization , research and development expenses , potential impairment of investments , the tax rate , and pending tax and legal proceedings . in addition to the various important factors discussed above , a number of other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations . demand for our products , which impacts our revenue and gross margin percentage , is affected by business and economic conditions , as well as computing and communications industry trends and the development and timing of introduction of compelling software applications and operating systems that take advantage of the features of our products . demand for our products is also affected by changes in customer order patterns , such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by our customers and the timing of customer purchases . we operate in intensely competitive industries , and our revenue and gross margin could be affected by factors such as competing chip architectures and manufacturing technologies , competing software-compatible microprocessors , pricing pressures , actions taken by our competitors and other competitive factors , as well as market acceptance of our new products in specific market segments , the availability of sufficient inventory to meet demand and the availability of externally purchased components or materials . our future revenue is also dependent on continuing technological advancement , including developing and implementing new processes and strategic products , as well as the timing of new product introductions , sustaining and growing new businesses , and integrating and operating any acquired businesses . our results could also be affected by adverse effects associated with product defects and errata ( deviations from published specifications ) , and by litigation or regulatory matters involving intellectual property or stockholder , consumer , antitrust and other issues . we believe that we have the product offerings , facilities , personnel and competitive and financial resources for continued business success , but future revenue , costs , gross margins and profits are all influenced by a number of factors , including those discussed above , all of which are inherently difficult to forecast . 34 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) status of business outlook and scheduled business updatewe expect that our corporate representatives will from time to time meet privately with investors , investment analysts , the media and others , and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the Â “ business outlook Â ” section and elsewhere in this form 10-q , including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this form 10-q . at the same time , we will keep this form 10-q and our then-current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site ( www . intc . comwe intend to publish a mid-quarter business update on december Â   8 , 2005 . from the close of business on december Â   2 , 2005 until publication of the update , we will observe a Â “ quiet period Â ” during which the business outlook and other forward-looking statements published in our earnings press releases on january Â   11 , 2005 , april Â   19 , 2005 , july Â   19 , 2005 and october Â   18 , 2005 , as reiterated or updated , as applicable , in our filings with the sec on forms 10-k and 10-q , should be considered historical , speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update . during the quiet period , our representatives will not comment on the business outlook or our financial results or expectations . a quiet period operating in similar fashion with regard to the business outlook and our sec filings will begin at the close of business on december Â   16 , 2005 and will extend until the day when our next quarterly earnings release is published , presently scheduled for january Â   17 , 2006 . we typically have quiet periods twice each quarter , in advance of our earnings release and mid-quarter business update ; however , the exact timing and duration of those routine quiet periods , and any others we utilize from time to time , may vary at our discretion . 35 Â

< date > 2004-09-25 < / date > < price > 20 . 13 < / price > < company > intc < / company > Â   we begin management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( md & a ) with a discussion of intel Â ’ s overall strategy and the strategies of our major business units to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the direction in which our business and products are moving . this strategy discussion is followed by a discussion of the Â “ critical accounting estimates Â ” that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results . we then discuss our Â “ results of operations , Â ” beginning with an Â “ overview Â ” , followed by an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows in the section entitled Â “ financial condition . Â ” finally , we conclude this md & a with our Â “ business outlook Â ” section , discussing our outlook for 2004 and the fourth quarter of 2004 . Â   the various sections of this md & a contain a number of forward-looking statements , all of which are based on current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in the Â “ business outlook Â ” section . our actual results may differ materially , and these forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures , mergers , acquisitions or other business combinations that had not been completed as of november 1 , 2004 . Â   strategy Â   our goal is to be the preeminent building block supplier to the worldwide internet economy . our primary focus is on developing advanced integrated silicon technology solutions , which we believe will provide the performance necessary to help accelerate the convergence of computing and communications capabilities with digital content . we believe that convergence is occurring primarily in three areas : the digital home , the digital enterprise and with mobile internet users . we also provide key components for the networking and communications infrastructure used to connect technology users . Â   we believe that users of computing and communications devices want improved performance , which includes faster processing performance and / or improved capabilities such as multithreaded or multitasking capability , seamless connectivity , improved security , reliability , ease of use and interoperability among devices . it is our goal to incorporate features addressing these capabilities in our various products to meet user demands . Â   the company consists of two reportable product-line operating segments : the intel architecture business and the intel communications group ( icg ) . both of our operating segments use their core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits , as well as key silicon and platform capabilities , to provide building blocks for technology solutions . the intel architecture business provides advanced technologies to support the desktop , mobile and enterprise computing market segments . icg focuses on wired and wireless connectivity products , component-level products and platform solutions for the wireless handheld communications and computing market segments , and key components for networking and communications infrastructure devices . in 2004 , the company combined its communications-related businesses into a single organization , icg . previously , these communications businesses were in two separate product line operating segments : the former intel communications group and the wireless communications and computing group ( wccg ) . Â   15 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   under our intel capital program , we make equity investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives . the intel capital program generally focuses on investing in companies and initiatives to stimulate growth in the internet economy and its infrastructure , create new business opportunities for intel and expand global markets for our products . the investments may support , among other things , intel product initiatives , emerging trends in the technology industry or worldwide internet deployment . we invest in companies that develop software , hardware and other technologies or provide services supporting technologies . our current investment focus areas include : enabling mobile and internet client devices , helping to create the digital home , advancing high-performance communications infrastructure and developing the next generation of silicon production technologies . our focus areas tend to develop and change over time due to rapid advancements in technology . Â   all of our businesses operate in highly innovative environments characterized by continuing and rapid introduction of new products that offer improved performance at lower prices . as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment , we use our core competencies and financial resources , as well as our global presence , brand recognition and the intel capital program . worldwide , our competitors range in size from large established multinational companies with multiple product lines , to smaller companies and new entrants to the marketplace that compete in specialized market segments . with the trend toward convergence in computing and communications products , product offerings will likely cross over multiple categories , offering us new opportunities , but also resulting in more businesses that compete with us . competition tends to increase pricing pressure on our products , which may mean that we must offer our products at lower prices than we had anticipated , resulting in lower profits . in market segments where our competitors have established products and brand recognition , it may be inherently difficult for us to compete against them . when we believe it is appropriate , we will take various steps , including introducing new products and discontinuing older products , reducing prices , and offering rebates and other incentives in order to increase acceptance of our latest products and to be competitive within each relevant market segment . Â   we plan to continue to cultivate new businesses and work with the computing , communications and consumer electronics industries through standards bodies , trade associations , original equipment manufacturers ( oems ) , original design manufacturers ( odms ) , and independent software and operating system vendors , to align the industry to offer products that take advantage of the latest market trends and usage models . these efforts include helping to create the infrastructure for wireless connectivity . we are also providing development tools and support to help software developers create software applications and operating systems that take advantage of our microprocessors , chipsets and other next-generation semiconductor devices with improved performance , including advanced technology capabilities integrated at the silicon level . Â   intel architecture business Â   the intel architecture business develops platform solutions based on our microprocessors , chipsets and board-level products , which are optimized for use in the desktop , mobile and server computing market segments . as devices continue to be developed that take advantage of converged computing and communications capabilities and digital content , our goal is to continue to deliver processors with improved performance . hyper-threading technology ( ht technology ) , which can enable an improved multitasking user environment , and intel Â ® Â ™ Â   to deliver processors with the next level of performance , we are working to increase the amount of built-in data-storage capacity on the chip , known as cache memory . higher amounts of cache memory allow for faster performance at equivalent processor speeds by allowing faster data retrieval for applications that can effectively use additional cache memory . we also announced plans to manufacture dual-core processors in the future . these products will incorporate two processor cores on a single chip and are expected to complement our effort to enable more capabilities , performance , and flexibility for end users beyond processor speed . Â   16 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   for the desktop market segment , our strategy is to introduce microprocessors and chipsets with improved performance , tailored to the needs of different market segments using a tiered branding approach . for the mobile market segment , our strategy is to deliver products optimized for some or all of the four mobility vectors : performance , battery life , form factor ( the physical size and shape of a device ) and wireless connectivity . our strategy for the enterprise market segment is to provide processors and chipsets with improved performance , which includes advanced technology features , as well as competitive price for performance for entry-level to high-end servers and workstations .

Â   17 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   intel communications group Â   within icg , our strategy is to be the leading supplier of silicon and other component-level communications building blocks for oems and other systems builders . we are focused on developing products that we believe will help to build out the internet as well as developing component-level products for the wireless handheld computing and communications market segments . Â   in support of the build out of the internet , we offer products designed for wired and wireless connectivity ; for the communications infrastructure , including network and embedded processors ; and for networked storage . our strategy for connectivity products is to expand our product portfolio in the local area network ( lan ) market segment and to address the metropolitan area network ( man ) and networked storage market segments . within the lan and man market segments , we are investing in gigabit ethernet , 10-gigabit ethernet and wireless technologies based on industry standards for wireless 802 . 11 ( wlan , or wifi ) mobile applications and the emerging standard supporting 802 . 16 ( or wimax ) for broadband connectivity . we currently offer a variety of wireless connectivity products based on the 802 . 11 standard for notebook pcs as part of intel centrino mobile technology . Â   in network processing , we deliver products that are basic building blocks for modular communications platforms . these products include advanced , programmable processors used to manage and direct data moving across the internet and corporate networks . we also offer embedded processors that can be used for modular communications platform applications as well as for industrial equipment and point-of-sale systems . in the networked storage market segment , we are developing products that allow storage resources to be added in either of the two most prevalent types of storage networks : ethernet or fibre channel . Â   component-level products for the wireless handheld computing and communications market segments include flash memory products , applications processors and cellular baseband chipsets . our strategy for our flash memory products is to offer a broad range of memory densities , leading-edge packaging technology and high-performance functionality . in addition to having offerings that meet the needs of cellular customers , we also offer flash memory products that meet the needs of other market segments , such as the broad market segment . the broad market segment includes flash memory products found in various applications , including set-top boxes , networking products , and other devices such as dvd players and dsl cable modems . in our flash memory product portfolio , we currently offer nor flash memory products such as intel strataflash Â ® Â ® Â   18 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   critical accounting estimates Â   the methods , estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements , which we discuss under the heading Â “ results of operations Â ” following this section of our md & a . some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments , often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain . our most critical accounting estimates include the assessment of recoverability of goodwill , which impacts goodwill impairments ; valuation of non-marketable equity securities , which impacts net gains ( losses ) on equity securities when we record impairments ; valuation of inventory , which impacts gross margin ; assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets , which primarily impacts gross margin when we impair manufacturing assets or accelerate their depreciation ; and recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities , which impacts our tax provision . below , we discuss these policies further , as well as the estimates and judgments involved . we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies , such as our policies for revenue recognition , including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors ; however , these policies do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective . Â   goodwill . Â   non-marketable equity securities Â   19 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   investments in non-marketable securities are inherently risky and a number of these companies are expected to fail . their success ( or lack thereof ) is dependent upon product development , market acceptance , operational efficiency and other key business success factors . in addition , depending on their future prospects , they may not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations , with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings , and the investments would likely become impaired . in the current equity market environment , the companies Â ’ ability to obtain additional funding as well as to take advantage of liquidity events , such as initial public offerings , mergers and private sales , remains constrained . Â   we review all of our investments quarterly for indicators of impairment ; however , for non-marketable equity securities , the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment . the indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances include ( a ) the investee Â ’ s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects , ( b ) the technological feasibility of the investee Â ’ s products and technologies , ( c ) the general market conditions in the investee Â ’ s industry or geographic area , including adverse regulatory or economic changes , ( d ) factors related to the investee Â ’ s ability to remain in business , such as the investee Â ’ s liquidity , debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash and ( e ) additional funding at a lower valuation . Â   investments identified as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired , in which case we write the investment down to its impaired value . when an investee is not considered viable from a financial or technological point of view , we write down the entire investment since we consider the estimated fair market value to be nominal . if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount or requires a new round of equity funding to stay in operation and the new funding does not appear imminent , we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired , unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise . impairments of investments in our portfolio , primarily impairments of non-marketable equity securities , were approximately $ 32 million in the third quarter of 2004 and $ 76 million in the first nine months of 2004 ( approximately $ 92 million in the third quarter of 2003 and $ 296 million in the first nine months of 2003 ) . Â   inventory . Â   long-lived assets . Â   impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows . due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity , we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings . in addition , as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions , we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets , primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements . when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated , and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the assets , we accelerate the rate of depreciation charges in order to fully depreciate the assets over their new shorter useful lives . Â   20 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   income taxes . Â   we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets . if recovery is not likely , we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable . as of september 25 , 2004 , we believed that all of the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet would ultimately be recovered . however , should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets , our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable . Â   in addition , the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations . we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the u . s . and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether , and the extent to which , additional taxes will be due . if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary , we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary . we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be . for a discussion of current tax matters , see Â “ note 14 : provision for taxes Â ” and Â “ note 15 : contingencies Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements . Â   21 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   results of operations Â – third quarter of 2004 compared to third quarter of 2003 Â   overview Â   in the third quarter of 2004 , we saw an improvement in our business compared to the third quarter of 2003 . this improvement is encouraging , and as we look ahead to the fourth quarter , we see further growth in our overall revenue . in addition , we expect to see growth in overall gross margin dollars ; however , our results are expected to be negatively impacted by modest pricing pressure , higher unit costs , as we work to reduce our inventory levels , an increase in start-up costs , as we ramp our next generation 65-nanometer process technology , as well as charges for some under-utilized factory capacity . our goal remains to grow total revenue and gross margin dollars . Â   we continue to be largely dependent on the success of our microprocessor business . revenue from sales of microprocessors within our intel architecture business represented approximately 70 % of our consolidated net revenue in the third quarter of 2004 , compared to 71 % in the second quarter of 2004 , and 74 % in the first quarter of 2004 . these lower percentages reflect increased sales of products such as flash memory , chipsets , and motherboards , which typically have lower gross margin percentages than microprocessors , and comprised a greater proportion of our revenue mix . growth in sales and profitability depends on our ability to successfully ramp new products , and to obtain continuing benefits from the productive use of our manufacturing assets for 90-nanometer process technology and 300mm wafers . in the third quarter of 2004 , we reached a key technology milestone as the majority of microprocessors for the computing market segment shipped in the quarter were built using our 90-nanometer process technology . however , going into the fourth quarter , inventories are still higher than we would like and we plan to continue to lower these inventory levels by slowing the growth rate of wafer starts , which will increase costs in the near term . Â   within icg , our flash memory group continued to increase revenues in the third quarter of 2004 , led by good demand for our higher density cellular products . however , the operating loss within icg doubled in third quarter from the second quarter . these results make it more challenging for icg to become profitable in 2005 .

Â   our asia-pacific region Â ’ s revenue comprised the largest portion of our total revenue in q3 2004 and increased 23 % compared to q3 2003 , reflecting both growth in local consumption and movement of more of the production for our customers Â ’ pc supply chain to asia . for the americas region , revenue declined 17 % in q3 2004 compared to q3 2003 , largely impacted by the continued movement of this supply chain to asia . for the europe region , revenue increased 12 % , and japan revenue increased 8 % in q3 2004 compared to q3 2003 . we experienced growth in both mature markets and emerging markets , in q3 2004 compared to q3 2003 . increases in sales in mature markets in the asia-pacific region and the europe region more than offset the decline in sales within mature markets in the americas region . our business relies on continued sales growth in emerging markets and continued business and consumer investment in technologies that use our products in mature markets . Â   our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 55 . 7 % for q3 2004 from 58 . 2 % in q3 2003 . the decrease in overall gross margin was due to lower gross margin percentages within both the intel architecture business and icg , combined with a shift in the total company revenue mix to the lower-margin icg products . see Â “ business outlook Â ” for a discussion of gross margin expectations . Â   23 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   intel architecture business Â   the revenue and operating income for the intel architecture operating segment for the third quarter of 2004 and 2003 were as follows : Â   ( in millions ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   q3 Â   2004 Â   Â   q3 Â   2003 microprocessor revenue Â   Â   $ 5 , 928 Â   Â   $ 5 , 719 chipset , motherboard and other revenue Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   1 , 210 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   1 , 140 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   net revenue Â   Â   $ 7 , 138 Â   Â   $ 6 , 859 operating income Â   Â   $ 2 , 790 Â   Â   $ 2 , 899 Â   net revenue for the intel architecture operating segment increased $ 279 million , or 4 % , in q3 2004 compared to q3 2003 . revenue from sales of microprocessors increased 4 % , while revenue from sales of chipsets , motherboards and other increased 6 % . the increase in revenue was primarily due to higher average selling prices of microprocessors , related to a shift in product mix . microprocessor revenue for q3 2003 included sales of microprocessors for the microsoft * xbox * , which had significantly lower average selling prices than microprocessors sold into the computing market segment . Â   operating income decreased $ 109 million , or 4 % , in q3 2004 compared to q3 2003 . the decrease was primarily due to higher operating expenses as well as higher inventory write downs , partially offset by higher revenue from sales of microprocessors ( see Â “ operating expenses Â ” below for further discussion on operating expense fluctuations ) . Â   intel communications group Â   the revenue and operating loss for the icg operating segment for the third quarter of 2004 and 2003 were as follows : Â   ( in millions ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   q3 Â   2004 Â   Â   q3 Â   2003 Â   net revenue Â   Â   $ 1 , 327 Â   Â   $ 973 Â   operating loss Â   Â   $ Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( 251 ) Â   $ Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( 208 ) Â   net revenue increased by $ 354 million , or 36 % , in q3 2004 compared to q3 2003 . this increase was primarily due to a significant increase in unit sales of flash memory products , with flash memory revenue increasing to $ 638 million in q3 2004 from $ 389 million in q3 2003 . the revenue increase for icg was also due to higher sales of embedded processing components , and to a lesser extent , wireless connectivity products , including the wireless components for our intel centrino mobile technology , as well as communications infrastructure components . Â   the operating loss increased to $ 251 million in q3 2004 , from a loss of $ 208 million in q3 2003 . the increase in operating loss was primarily due to the negative impact of revaluing inventory balances at the end of the quarter to lower current replacement costs , as well as increased sales of higher density flash memory products , which have higher unit costs . in addition , higher operating expenses caused an increase in the operating loss . these increases in operating loss were partially offset by higher revenue .

Â   interest and other , net increased to $ 63 million in q3 2004 compared to $ 34 million in q3 2003 , primarily due to higher interest income due to higher average investment balances combined with higher average interest rates . Â   our effective income tax rate was 21 . 4 % for q3 2004 , compared to 27 . 2 % for q3 2003 . in connection with preparing and filing our 2003 federal tax return and preparing state tax returns , we reduced our tax provision for q3 2004 by $ 195 million , reflecting additional benefits for export sales along with state tax benefits for divestitures in addition to the amounts originally estimated in connection with the 2003 provision . the rate for q3 2003 included a reduction to the tax provision of $ 125 million related to a divestiture . finally , the q3 2004 tax rate reflected a change in our estimate as a result of a greater proportion of our profits being generated in lower tax jurisdictions compared to q3 2003 .

Â   the operating loss decreased to $ 596 million in the first nine months of 2004 from a loss of $ 681 million in the first nine months of 2003 . higher revenue , as well as approximately $ 140 million from lower inventory write-offs for flash memory products due to improved demand , and sales of flash memory product inventory that had been previously written down , contributed to the lower operating loss . these improvements were partially offset by higher unit costs for flash memory products as we sold higher density products , as well as the negative impact of revaluing ending inventory to lower current replacement costs . in addition , the impact of higher inventory write-offs , primarily for certain applications and cellular processors , partially offset the decrease in operating loss . Â   27 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   operating expenses Â   operating expenses for the first nine months of 2004 and 2003 were as follows : Â   ( in millions ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ytd Â   2004 Â   Â   ytd Â   2003 research and development Â   Â   $ 3 , 564 Â   Â   $ 3 , 183 marketing , general and administrative Â   Â   $ Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   3 , 434 Â   Â   $ Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   3 , 137 impairment of goodwill Â   Â   $ Â — Â   Â   $ 6 amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs Â   Â   $ 141 Â   Â   $ 236 purchased in-process research and development Â   Â   $ Â — Â   Â   $ 5 Â   research and development spending increased $ 381 million , or 12 % , in the first nine months of 2004 compared to the first nine months of 2003 . this increase was primarily due to higher expenses related to development for manufacturing process technologies , including the 65-nanometer process on 300-millimeter wafers , and higher expenses for product development programs in the intel architecture business , as well as higher profit-dependent compensation expenses . marketing , general and administrative expenses increased $ 297 million , or 9 % , in the first nine months of 2004 compared to the first nine months of 2003 , primarily due to higher cooperative advertising expenses , as a result of higher revenue in our intel architecture business and because our customers used a higher percentage of their available intel inside Â ® Â   amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs was $ 141 million in the first nine months of 2004 compared to $ 236 million in the first nine months of 2003 , as a portion of the intangibles related to prior acquisitions became fully amortized . Â   gains ( losses ) on equity securities , interest and other , and taxes Â   gains ( losses ) on equity securities , net , interest and other , net and taxes for the first nine months of 2004 and 2003 were as follows : Â   ( in millions ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ytd Â   2004 Â   Â   ytd Â   2003 Â   gains ( losses ) on equity securities , net Â   Â   $ 1 Â   Â   $ ( 248 ) interest and other , net Â   Â   $ 159 Â   Â   $ 139 Â   provision for taxes Â   Â   $ Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   1 , 997 Â   Â   $ Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   1 , 394 Â   Â   gains ( losses ) on equity securities and certain equity derivatives for the first nine months of 2004 was a net gain of $ 1 million compared to a net loss of $ 248 million for the first nine months of 2003 . the improvement was primarily driven by lower impairment charges on investments , particularly on non-marketable equity securities ( approximately $ 76 million for the first nine months of 2004 and $ 296 million for the first nine months of 2003 ) . the net loss for the first nine months of 2003 also included mark to market losses on certain equity securities and equity derivatives offset by gains on equity transactions in 2003 . Â   interest and other , net increased to $ 159 million for the first nine months of 2004 compared to $ 139 million for the first nine months of 2003 , primarily due to higher interest income as a result of higher average investment balances . Â   28 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   our effective income tax rate was 27 . 0 % for the first nine months of 2004 , compared to 28 . 7 % for the first nine months of 2003 . the rate for the first nine months of 2004 included a $ 195 million reduction to the tax provision , primarily from additional benefits for export sales along with state tax benefits for divestitures , as well as the reversal of previously accrued taxes of $ 62 million , primarily related to the closing of a state income tax audit . the rate for the first nine months of 2003 included a $ 138 million reduction to the tax provision related to divestitures . finally , compared to 2003 , the rate for the first nine months of 2004 reflected a greater proportion of our profits being generated in lower tax jurisdictions . Â   financial condition Â   our financial condition remains strong . at september 25 , 2004 , cash , short-term investments and fixed income instruments included in trading assets totaled $ 15 . 8 billion ( $ 15 . 9 billion at december 27 , 2003 ) . total short-term and long-term debt was $ 1 . 1 billion at september 25 , 2004 ( $ 1 . 2 billion at december 27 , 2003 ) and represented 3 % of stockholders Â ’ equity both at september 25 , 2004 and december 27 , 2003 . Â   for the first nine months of 2004 , cash provided by operating activities was $ 9 . 0 billion ( $ 7 . 5 billion for the first nine months of 2003 ) . cash was provided by net income adjusted for non-cash related items . uses of cash for net working capital included increases in inventories and accounts receivable and decreases in accrued compensation and benefits , partially offset by increases in income taxes payable and accounts payable . net inventory was higher by 26 % at the end of the third quarter of 2004 compared to december 2003 as we continued to ramp new products for sale in the remainder of 2004 and into 2005 . approximately half of the increase was for microprocessors and the other half was split between flash memory and chipsets . during the last quarter of the year , we expect to continue our effort to lower the inventory levels of microprocessors by slowing the growth rate of wafer starts from the rate we had originally planned for these products . accounts receivable increased over december 2003 levels , primarily due to a higher proportion of sales occurring toward the end of the current quarter . the days sales outstanding decreased from 36 days in december 2003 to 35 days at the end of the current quarter . our three largest customers accounted for approximately 42 % of net revenue for the first nine months of 2004 , with one of these customers accounting for approximately 18 % of net revenue and another customer accounting for approximately 16 % of net revenue . for the first nine months of 2003 , our three largest customers accounted for approximately 41 % of net revenue . additionally , those three largest customers accounted for approximately 38 % of net accounts receivable at september 25 , 2004 ( 43 % at december 27 , 2003 ) . accrued compensation and benefits decreased during the first nine months of 2004 as we paid year-end and semi-annual bonuses and made the annual cash contribution to our profit sharing plan . the increase in the accrual for income taxes payable is due to the timing of payments and refunds . accounts payable increased at the end of the third quarter of 2004 compared to december 2003 primarily due to the timing of capital expenditures . Â   we used $ 5 . 0 billion in net cash for investing activities during the first nine months of 2004 , compared to $ 3 . 6 billion during the first nine months of 2003 . improved corporate credit profiles facilitated a slight shift in our portfolio of investments in debt securities to longer term maturities . capital expenditures were $ 2 . 8 billion in the first nine months of 2004 , compared to $ 2 . 9 billion in the first nine months of 2003 . we continued to invest in capital equipment and construction , primarily for additional microprocessor manufacturing capacity . Â   we used $ 5 . 5 billion in net cash for financing activities in the first nine months of 2004 , compared to $ 1 . 9 billion in the first nine months of 2003 . the major financing use of cash was for the repurchase of shares as we repurchased 211 . 5 million shares of common stock for $ 5 . 5 billion compared to 114 . 4 million shares for $ 2 . 0 billion in the same period in 2003 . as of september 25 , 2004 , approximately 203 million shares remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization . Â   additional financing uses of cash in the first nine months of 2004 included payments of dividends . in january 2004 , our board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $ 0 . 02 per share to $ 0 . 04 per share , effective for the first-quarter 2004 dividend . therefore , our dividend payments were $ 770 million in the first nine months of 2004 , higher than the $ 393 million paid in the same period of the prior year . financing sources of cash during the first nine months of 2004 were primarily $ 793 million in proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee stock plans ( $ 712 million during the first nine months of 2003 ) . Â   29 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   another potential source of liquidity is authorized borrowings , including commercial paper , of $ 3 . 0 billion . maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during the first nine months of 2004 were approximately $ 550 million , although no commercial paper was outstanding at the end of the period . we also maintain the ability to offer an aggregate of approximately $ 1 . 4 billion in debt , equity and other securities under u . s . securities and exchange commission ( sec ) shelf registration statements . Â   we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet our business requirements for the next twelve months , including capital expenditures for the expansion or upgrading of worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test capacity , working capital requirements , the dividend program , potential stock repurchases and potential future acquisitions or strategic investments . Â   30 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   employee equity incentive plans Â   our equity incentive program is a broad-based , long-term retention program that is intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests . substantially all of our employees participate in our equity incentive program . in may 2004 , stockholder approval was obtained for the 2004 equity incentive plan ( the 2004 plan ) . under the 2004 plan , 240 million shares of common stock were made available for issuance during the two year period ending june 30 , 2006 . under the 2004 plan , options to purchase shares may be granted to all employees and non-employee directors . we may also use other equity incentive award types , such as restricted stock , stock units and stock appreciation rights . the 2004 plan also allows for performance-based vesting for equity incentive awards . the intel corporation 1984 stock option plan expired in may 2004 , and the intel corporation 1997 stock option plan was terminated upon stockholder approval of the 2004 plan . shares previously authorized for issuance under these plans are no longer available for future grants . Â   options granted by the company under the 2004 plan will generally expire seven years from the grant date . options granted under our previous stock option plans generally expire ten years from the grant date . options granted to existing and newly hired employees generally vest over a four year period from the date of grant . certain grants to key employees expire ten years from the date of grant and have delayed vesting generally beginning five or six years from the date of grant . Â   we have a goal to keep the potential incremental dilution related to our equity incentive programs to a long-term average of less than 2 % annually . the dilution percentage is calculated using the new option grants for the year , net of options forfeited by employees leaving the company and options expired , divided by the total outstanding shares at the beginning of the year . Â   options granted to employees , including officers , and non-employee directors from 2000 through the first nine months of 2004 are summarized as follows : Â   ( shares in millions ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ytd Â   Â   2003 Â   Â   2002 Â   Â   2001 Â   Â   2000 Â   total options granted1 Â   Â   99 Â   Â   110 Â   Â   174 Â   Â   238 Â   Â   163 Â   less options forfeited1 Â   Â   ( 24 ) Â   ( 40 ) Â   ( 44 ) Â   ( 47 ) Â   ( 31 ) net options granted Â   Â   75 Â   Â   70 Â   Â   130 Â   Â   191 Â   Â   132 Â   net grants as % of outstanding shares2 Â   Â   1 . 2 % Â   1 . 1 % Â   1 . 9 % Â   2 . 8 % Â   2 . 0 % grants to listed officers3 as % of total options granted Â   Â   1 . 1 % Â   2 . 4 % Â   1 . 7 % Â   0 . 8 % Â   0 . 4 % grants to listed officers3 as % of outstanding shares2 Â   Â   < 0 . 1 % Â   < 0 . 1 % Â   < 0 . 1 % Â   < 0 . 1 % Â   < 0 . 1 % cumulative options held by listed officers3 as % of total options outstanding Â   Â   2 . 1 % Â   2 . 1 % Â   2 . 1 % Â   2 . 0 % Â   2 . 4 % Â   1excluding options assumed in connection with acquisitions . 2outstanding shares as of the beginning of each period . 3 Â “ listed officers Â ” for 2004 are those listed in our proxy statement dated march 31 , 2004 , defined as our chief executive officer and each of the four other most highly compensated executive officers .

Â   Â   information as of september 25 , 2004 regarding equity incentive plans approved and not approved by stockholders is summarized in the following table ( shares in millions ) : Â   plan category Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( a ) number Â   of Â   shares Â   to Â   be Â   ( b ) weighted-average Â   Â   ( c ) number Â   of Â   shares Â   remainingplans ( excluding shares equity incentive plans approved Â   by Â   stockholders Â   Â   146 . 6 Â   Â   Â   $ 18 . 12 Â   Â   303 . 11 equity incentive plans not Â   approved Â   by Â   stockholders Â   Â   731 . 7 Â   Â   Â   $ 27 . 96 Â   Â   Â — Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   total Â   Â   878 . 32 Â   $ 26 . 31 Â   Â   303 . 11 includes 67 . 5 million shares available under our 1976 employee stock participation plan . 2 total excludes 6 . 9 million shares issuable under outstanding options , with a weighted average exercise price of $ 16 . 30 , originally granted under plans we assumed in connection with acquisitions Â   Â   33 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   business outlook Â   for the fourth quarter of 2004 , we expect revenue to be between $ 8 . 6 billion and $ 9 . 2 billion , compared to third quarter revenue of $ 8 . 5 billion . the midpoint of this range would be a sequential increase of approximately 5 % , which is at the lower end of seasonal patterns typical for the fourth quarter . this forecast is tempered by the assumption that our customers will continue to reduce inventory levels in the fourth quarter . it also anticipates modest pricing pressure in microprocessors . icg revenue is largely dependent on our continuing to secure design wins for our customers Â ’ new and existing products , on supplying the products for these design wins and on oems taking the product designs to production . demand for our flash memory products is uncertain in the highly competitive cellular handset market segment . revenue growth for our flash memory products is largely dependent on customer demand for higher density flash memory and continued end user adoption of new leading-edge cellular handsets . Â   our financial results are substantially dependent on sales of microprocessors and related components by the intel architecture operating segment . revenue is partly a function of the mix of microprocessor types and performance capabilities sold , as well as the mix of related chipsets and motherboards , all of which are difficult to forecast . because of the wide price differences among desktop , mobile and server microprocessors , the mix of types and performance levels of microprocessors sold affects the average selling price that we will realize and has a large impact on our revenue and gross margin . microprocessor revenue is also dependent on the availability of other parts of the system platform , including chipsets , motherboards , operating system software and application software . revenue is also affected by our sales of other semiconductor and non-semiconductor products and is subject to the impact of economic conditions in various geographic regions . Â   we expect the gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter of 2004 to be approximately 56 % , plus or minus a couple of points , approximately flat compared to the third quarter . this margin percentage would be lower than would be typical with the projected revenue growth . by slowing the rate of growth of wafer starts to reduce inventories , we will also increase unit costs in the near term . at the same time , the modest pricing pressure will probably lower product margin . we also anticipate charges for under-utilization of 200 millimeter factory capacity and start-up costs for 65-nanometer manufacturing process technology . our gross margin varies primarily with revenue levels , which are dependent on unit volumes and prices , as well as the mix of types and performance levels of processors sold , and the mix of microprocessors , related chipsets and motherboards , and other semiconductor and non-semiconductor products . variability of other factors will also continue to affect cost of sales and the gross margin percentage , including unit costs and yield issues associated with production at our factories , timing and execution of the manufacturing ramp , excess of manufacturing capacity , the reusability of factory equipment , impairment of manufacturing or assembly and test assets , excess inventory , inventory obsolescence and variations in inventory valuation . Â   we have significantly expanded our semiconductor manufacturing and assembly and test capacity over the last few years , and we continue to plan capacity based on the assumed continued success of our overall strategy and the acceptance of our products in specific market segments . we currently expect that capital spending will be between $ 3 . 6 billion and $ 4 . 0 billion in 2004 , compared to $ 3 . 7 billion in 2003 . the midpoint of this range , $ 3 . 8 billion , is only slightly higher than 2003 . this capital-spending plan is dependent on expectations regarding production efficiencies and delivery times of various machinery and equipment , and construction schedules for new facilities . if the demand for our products does not grow and continue to move toward higher performance products in the various market segments , revenue and gross margin would be adversely affected and manufacturing and / or assembly and test capacity would be under-utilized , and the rate of capital spending could be reduced . we could be required to record an impairment of our manufacturing or assembly and test equipment and / or facilities , or factory planning decisions may cause us to record accelerated depreciation . however , in the long term , revenue and gross margin may also be affected if we do not add capacity fast enough to meet market demand . Â   we expect depreciation expense to be between $ 1 . 1 billion and $ 1 . 2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2004 . Â   34 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   spending on research and development , plus marketing , general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2004 is expected to be between $ 2 . 4 billion and $ 2 . 5 billion , slightly higher than the third quarter . expenses , particularly certain marketing and compensation-related expenses , may vary from this expectation , depending in part on the level of revenue and profits . Â   research and development spending is expected to be approximately $ 4 . 7 billion in 2004 , slightly below the previous expectation of $ 4 . 8 billion . Â   based on acquisitions completed through november 1 , 2004 , we expect amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs to be approximately $ 40 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 . Â   we expect the net gains from equity securities and interest and other for the fourth quarter of 2004 to be approximately $ 65 million . our expectations for gains ( losses ) from equity securities include impairment charges on private equity investments and are based on our experience . it is not possible to know at the present time whether specific investments are likely to be impaired or the extent or timing of individual impairments . in addition , our expectations for gains or losses from equity securities and interest and other could vary depending on equity market levels and volatility , gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities , interest rates , cash balances , and changes in the fair value of derivative instruments . Â   at september 25 , 2004 , we held non-marketable equity securities with a carrying value of $ 617 million . a number of these companies are expected to fail . their success ( or lack thereof ) is dependent upon product development , market acceptance , operational efficiency and other key business success factors . in addition , depending on their future prospects , they may not be able to raise additional financings when needed or they may receive lower valuations , with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings , and the investments would likely become impaired . however , we are not able determine at the present time which specific investments are likely to be impaired in the future , or the extent or timing of individual impairments . Â   our non-marketable equity securities are part of the intel capital program . the program seeks to invest in companies and businesses that can succeed and have an impact on their market segment . however , these types of investments involve a great deal of risk , and there can be no assurance that any specific company , whether at an early or mature stage , or somewhere in between , will grow or will be successful , and consequently , we could lose all or part of our investment . when the strategic objectives of an investment have been achieved , or if the investment or business diverges from our strategic objectives , we may decide to dispose of the investment . however , our investments in non-marketable equity securities are not liquid , and there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of these investments on favorable terms or at all . Â   we currently expect our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2004 to be approximately 30 . 5 % . the estimated effective tax rate is based on tax law in effect at september 25 , 2004 and current expected income , and assumes the company continues to receive the tax benefit for export sales ( see Â “ note 14 : provision for taxes Â ” and Â “ note 15 : contingencies Â ” in notes to consolidated condensed financial statements ) . the tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2004 does not include any potential effect of the american jobs creation act of 2004 ( the jobs act ) as we are currently reviewing the provisions of the jobs act . the tax rate may also be affected by the closing of acquisitions or divestitures , the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed , the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities , the finalization of various tax returns and the ability to realize deferred tax assets . Â   as of september 25 , 2004 , we have approximately $ 3 . 7 billion of goodwill remaining on our balance sheet , of which $ 3 . 2 billion is related to the icg operating segment and $ 533 million is related to the intel architecture operating segment . particularly for icg , we may incur charges for the impairment of goodwill in the future if the communications and mobile handheld computing sectors do not grow as we expect , if icg fails to deliver new products , if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance , if we fail to achieve our assumed revenue growth rates or assumed gross margin , or if interest rates increase significantly . Â   35 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   we are currently a party to various legal proceedings and claims , including legal proceedings and claims related to taxes and to allegations of patent infringement . management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations . however , litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur . an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages , invalidation of a patent or group of patents , additional taxes owed or , in cases where injunctive relief is sought , an injunction prohibiting intel from selling one or more products . if an unfavorable ruling were to occur in any specific period , there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations of that period or future periods . management believes that , given our current liquidity and cash and investment balances , even an adverse judgment would not have a material impact on cash and investments or liquidity . Â   we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the u . s . and abroad , and if we determine that it is necessary or desirable , we may seek licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights from others . while our patents and the intellectual property licenses we obtain are an important element of our success , our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any one patent . however , an injunction preventing us from selling products based on one or more patents could have a material adverse effect upon our business . there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products . we can also give no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses from any intellectual property owner where needed , or that we can accept the terms of any offered licenses . further , we are not typically able to resolve every dispute without litigation , which is generally time-consuming and expensive . if we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation , we may not be able to sell a particular product or family of products due to an injunction , or we may have to pay material amounts of damages . Â   our sales agreements often contain intellectual property indemnities , such as patent and copyright indemnities , and our customers may assert claims against us for indemnity when they receive claims from other intellectual property owners alleging that our customers Â ’ products infringe such others Â ’ intellectual property rights . when we receive such claims , we refer them to our counsel . current claims are in various stages of evaluation , negotiation and litigation . such claims may result in our participation in or defense against the claims asserted against our customers by such other intellectual property owners , including participation in and defense of litigation against our customers . Â   we operate globally , with sales offices and research and development as well as manufacturing and assembly and test facilities in many countries , and , as a result , we are subject to risks and factors associated with doing business outside the u . s . global operations involve inherent risks that include currency controls and fluctuations , tariff and import regulations , and regulatory requirements that may limit our or our customers Â ’ ability to manufacture , assemble and test , design , develop or sell products in particular countries . if terrorist activity , armed conflict , civil or military unrest , or political instability occurs in the u . s . , israel or other locations , such events may disrupt manufacturing , assembly and test , logistics , security and communications , and could also result in reduced demand for intel Â ’ s products . the impacts of major health concerns or possible infrastructure disruptions , such as large-scale outages or interruptions of service from utilities or telecommunication providers , on intel , its suppliers , customers or other third parties could also adversely affect our business and impact customer order patterns . we could also be affected if labor issues disrupt our transportation arrangements or those of our customers or suppliers . on a worldwide basis , we regularly review our key infrastructure , systems , services and suppliers , both internally and externally , to seek to identify significant vulnerabilities as well as areas of potential business impact if a disruptive event were to occur . once identified , we assess the risks , and as we consider it to be appropriate , we initiate actions intended to reduce the risks and their potential impact . however , there can be no assurance that we have identified all significant risks or that we can mitigate all identified risks with reasonable effort . Â   36 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   our future results of operations and the other forward-looking statements contained in this filing , including this md & a , involve a number of risks and uncertainties Â — in particular , the statements regarding our goals and strategies , new product introductions , plans to cultivate new businesses , market segment share and growth rate assumptions , future economic conditions and recovery in the communications businesses , revenue , pricing , gross margin and costs , capital spending , depreciation and amortization , research and development expenses , potential impairment of investments , the tax rate and pending tax and legal proceedings . in addition to various factors that we have discussed above , a number of other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations . demand for our products , which impacts our revenue and gross margin percentage , is affected by business and economic conditions , as well as computing and communications industry trends and the development and timing of introduction of compelling software applications and operating systems that take advantage of the features of our products . demand for our products is also affected by changes in customer order patterns , such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by our customers and the timing of customer purchases . intel operates in intensely competitive industries and our revenue and gross margin could be affected by factors , such as competing chip architectures and manufacturing technologies , competing software-compatible microprocessors , pricing pressures , actions taken by our competitors and other competitive factors , as well as market acceptance of our new products in specific market segments , the availability of sufficient inventory to meet demand and the availability of externally purchased components or materials . our future revenue is also dependent on continuing technological advancement , including developing and implementing new processes and strategic products , as well as the timing of new product introductions , sustaining and growing new businesses , and integrating and operating any acquired businesses . our results could also be affected by adverse effects associated with product defects and errata ( deviations from published specifications ) and by litigation or regulatory matters involving intellectual property , Â   we believe that we have the product offerings , facilities , personnel , and competitive and financial resources for continued business success , but future revenue , costs , margins and profits are all influenced by a number of factors , including those discussed above , all of which are inherently difficult to forecast . Â   37 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   status of business outlook and scheduled business update Â   we expect that our corporate representatives will from time to time meet privately with investors , investment analysts , the media and others , and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the Â “ business outlook Â ” section and elsewhere in this form 10-q , including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this form 10-q . at the same time , we will keep this form 10-q and our then current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site ( www . intc . com Â   we intend to publish a mid-quarter business update on december 2 , 2004 . from the close of business on november 24 , 2004 until publication of the update , we will observe a Â “ quiet period Â ” during which the business outlook and other forward-looking statements published in our earnings press releases on january 14 , 2004 , april 13 , 2004 , july 13 , 2004 and october 12 , 2004 as reiterated or updated , as applicable , in our filings with the sec on forms 10-k and 10-q , should be considered historical , speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update . during the quiet period , our representatives will not comment on the business outlook or our financial results or expectations . Â   a quiet period operating in similar fashion with regard to the business outlook and our sec filings will begin at the close of business on december 10 , 2004 and will extend until the day when our next quarterly earnings release is published , presently scheduled for january 11 , 2005 . Â   other information Â   our independent auditor , ernst & young llp ( e & y ) has recently notified the sec , the public company accounting oversight board and the audit committee of intel Â ’ s board of directors that certain non-audit work it previously performed in china , for intel and other companies , has raised questions regarding e & y Â ’ s independence with respect to its performance of audit services . Â   with respect to intel , during fiscal years 2001 and 2002 , e & y Â ’ s affiliated firm in china performed tax calculation and return preparation services for a small number of employees of a representative office of intel in china . e & y Â ’ s china affiliate made payment of the relevant taxes on behalf of intel , which involved the handling of intel funds in the amount of approximately $ 65 , 000 in 2001 and $ 42 , 000 in 2002 . the fees paid by intel to e & y Â ’ s china affiliate for the performance of these services were approximately $ 1 , 200 in 2001 and $ 600 in 2002 . these services were discontinued in 2002 . Â   intel Â ’ s audit committee has reviewed the facts surrounding these services provided by e & y , and is monitoring the outcome of the sec Â ’ s consideration of this matter . e & y has informed the audit committee that they do not believe their independence was impaired by the performance of these services . subject to the sec completing its consideration of the matter , neither intel nor its audit committee believes that e & y Â ’ s independence was impaired by the performance of these services in light of the de minimis Â   38

< date > 2012-03-31 < / date > < price > 98 . 10 < / price > < company > mcd < / company > overview the company franchises and operates mcdonald Â ’ s restaurants . of the 33 , 517 restaurants in 119 countries at march Â   31 , 2012 , 27 , 074 were licensed to franchisees ( including 19 , 487 franchised to conventional franchisees , 3 , 965 licensed to developmental licensees and 3 , 622 licensed to foreign affiliates ( affiliates ) Â – primarily japan ) and 6 , 443 were operated by the company . under our conventional franchise arrangement , franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment , signs , seating and d Ã © cor of their restaurant businesses , and by reinvesting in the business over time . the company owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites . this maintains long-term occupancy rights , helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees . in certain circumstances , the company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants . under our developmental license arrangement , licensees provide capital for the entire business , including the real estate interest , and the company has no capital invested . in addition , the company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate and / or franchise restaurants within a market . we view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and believe franchising is important to delivering great , locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability . Â   however , directly operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and is essential to providing company personnel with restaurant operations experience . Â   in our company-operated restaurants , and in collaboration with franchisees , we further develop and refine operating standards , marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies , so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants . Â   we continually review , and as appropriate adjust , our mix of company-operated and franchised ( conventional franchised , developmental licensed and foreign affiliated ) restaurants to help optimize overall performance . the company Â ’ s revenues consist of sales by company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees . revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments , and initial fees . revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales , and generally include initial fees . fees vary by type of site , amount of company investment , if any , and local business conditions . these fees , along with occupancy and operating rights , are stipulated in franchise / license agreements that generally have 20-year terms . the business is managed as distinct geographic segments . significant reportable segments include the united states ( u . s . ) , europe , and asia / pacific , middle east and africa ( apmea ) . in addition , throughout this report we present Â “ other countries Â   & corporate Â ” that includes operations in canada and latin america , as well as corporate activities . the u . s . , europe and apmea segments account for 32 % , 39 % and 24 % of total revenues , respectively . strategic direction and financial performance the strength of the alignment between the company , its franchisees and suppliers ( collectively referred to as the system ) has been key to mcdonald Â ’ s success . this business model enables mcdonald Â ’ s to consistently deliver locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve . in addition , it facilitates our ability to identify , implement and scale innovative ideas that meet customers Â ’ changing needs and preferences . mcdonald Â ’ s customer-focused plan to win Â — which concentrates on being better , not just bigger Â — provides a common framework for our global business while allowing for local adaptation . through the execution of multiple initiatives surrounding the five elements of our plan to win Â — people , products , place , price and promotion Â — we have enhanced the restaurant experience for customers worldwide and grown comparable sales and customer visits in each of the last eight years . this plan , combined with financial discipline , has delivered strong results for our shareholders . the company Â ’ s growth priorities under the plan to win include : optimizing the menu with the right food and beverage offerings , modernizing the customer experience by upgrading nearly every aspect of our restaurants from service to designs , and broadening our accessibility through continued convenience and value initiatives . the combination of all of these efforts successfully resonated with consumers , driving increases in comparable sales and customer visits in many countries despite a challenging global economy and relatively flat or contracting informal eating out ( ieo ) market . as a result , for the first quarter 2012 every area of the world contributed to global comparable sales and guest counts , which increased 7 . 3 % and 4 . 8 % , respectively . Â   12 growth in comparable sales is driven by changes in guest counts and average check , which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix . Â   generally , the goal is to achieve a balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check . in the u . s . , first quarter 2012 comparable sales of 8 . 9 % were driven by the ongoing popularity of mcdonald Â ’ s core favorites , menu innovations such as chicken mcbites , the enhanced customer experience of mcdonald Â ’ s reimaged restaurants and favorable weather . ongoing u . s . initiatives include balancing core menu classics with new products and promotional food events ; providing everyday value ; modernizing our restaurants through the major remodel program and technology enhancements ; and broadening accessibility with expanded hours and additional staffing at peak hours . despite ongoing sales momentum in the u . s . , we expect to face continued cost pressures that will impact company-operated margins at least through the second quarter . europe Â ’ s emphasis on everyday affordability , premium product innovation and restaurant reimaging contributed to 5 . 0 % comparable sales growth for the first quarter 2012 . europe Â ’ s strategic priorities include increasing local relevance by complementing our tiered menu with a variety of promotional food events , enhancing the customer experience through ongoing restaurant reimaging and technology initiatives , and reducing our impact on the environment with energy management tools . although our european business will continue to face headwinds due to economic uncertainty and government-initiated austerity measures , we remain confident that our business model will continue to drive profitable growth . apmea Â ’ s comparable sales increase of 5 . 5 % in the first quarter 2012 reflected a strong execution of the segment Â ’ s core menu , compelling value and convenience strategies . apmea will continue efforts to become our customers Â ’ first choice for eating out by providing robust value platforms , focusing on menu variety and the restaurant experience , and executing convenience initiatives , such as expanding delivery service and extended operating hours . in addition , apmea will grow our business by opening approximately 750 new restaurants and reimaging existing restaurants , while elevating the focus on service and operations to drive efficiencies . operating highlights included : Â   Â   Â • Â   global comparable sales increased 7 . 3 % for the quarter , and benefited from one additional day due to leap year . Â   Â   Â • Â   consolidated operating income increased 8 % ( 9 % in constant currencies ) for the quarter . Â   Â   Â • Â   diluted earnings per share was $ 1 . 23 for the quarter , up 7 % ( 8 % in constant currencies ) . foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $ 0 . 01 on diluted earnings per share . Â   Â   Â • Â   for the three months ended march Â   31 , 2012 , the company repurchased 8 . 1 Â   million shares for $ 802 . 8 million and paid total dividends of $ 0 . 70 per share or $ 712 . 3 million . outlook while the company does not provide specific guidance on earnings per share , the following information is provided to assist in forecasting the company Â ’ s future results . Â   Â   Â • Â   changes in systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion . the company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 2 percentage points to 2012 systemwide sales growth ( in constant currencies ) , most of which will be due to the 872 net traditional restaurants added in 2011 . Â   Â   Â • Â   the company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales . however , as a perspective , assuming no change in cost structure , a 1 percentage point increase in comparable sales for either the u . s . or europe would increase annual diluted earnings per share by about 3-4 cents . Â   Â   Â • Â   with about 75 % of mcdonald Â ’ s grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities , a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the company Â ’ s commodity costs . for the full year 2012 , the total basket of goods cost is expected to increase 4 . 5-5 . 5 % in the u . s . and 2 . 5-3 . 5 % in europe , with more pressure expected in the first half . Â   Â   Â • Â   the company expects full-year 2012 selling , general Â   & administrative expenses to increase approximately 6 % in constant currencies , driven by certain technology investments , primarily to accelerate future restaurant capabilities , and costs related to the 2012 worldwide owner / operator convention and olympics . the company expects the magnitude of the increase to be confined to 2012 . fluctuations will be experienced between quarters due to the timing of certain items such as the worldwide owner / operator convention in the second quarter and the olympics in the third quarter . Â   Â   Â • Â   based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates , the company expects interest expense for the full year 2012 to increase between 8 % and 10 % compared with 2011 . Â   13 Â   Â • Â   a significant part of the company Â ’ s operating income is generated outside the u . s . , and about 40 % of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies . accordingly , earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates , particularly the euro , british pound , australian dollar and canadian dollar . collectively , these currencies represent approximately 65 % of the company Â ’ s operating income outside the u . s . if all four of these currencies moved by 10 % in the same direction , the company Â ’ s annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 24 cents . Â   Â   Â • Â   the company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2012 to be 31 % to 33 % . some volatility may be experienced between the quarters resulting in a quarterly tax rate that is outside the annual range . Â   Â   Â • Â   the company expects capital expenditures for 2012 to be approximately $ 2 . 9 billion . about half of this amount will be used to open new restaurants . the company expects to open more than 1 , 300 restaurants including about 450 restaurants in affiliated and developmental licensee markets , such as japan and latin america , where the company does not fund any capital expenditures . the company expects net additions of about 900 restaurants . the remaining capital will be used for reinvestment in existing restaurants . nearly half of this reinvestment will be used to reimage more than 2 , 400 locations worldwide , some of which will require no capital investment from the company . the following definitions apply to these terms as used throughout this form 10-q : Â   Â   Â • Â   information in constant currency Â   Â   Â • Â   systemwide salesfranchised sales Â   Â   Â • Â   comparable salescomparable guest countscalendar shift / trading day adjustment Â   14 Â   consolidated operating results Â   Â   dollars in millions , except per share data Â   Â   quarter ended Â   Â   Â   Â   amount Â   Â   % Â   increase Â   revenues Â   Â   Â   sales by company-operated restaurants Â   Â   $ 4 , 432 . 2 Â   Â   Â   Â   7 Â   Â   revenues from franchised restaurants Â   Â   Â   2 , 114 . 4 Â   Â   Â   Â   8 Â   Â   total revenues Â   Â   Â   6 , 546 . 6 Â   Â   Â   Â   7 Â   Â   operating costs and expenses Â   Â   Â   company-operated restaurant expenses Â   Â   Â   3 , 654 . 4 Â   Â   Â   Â   7 Â   Â   franchised restaurants Â — occupancy expenses Â   Â   Â   374 . 7 Â   Â   Â   Â   6 Â   Â   selling , general Â   & administrative expenses Â   Â   Â   592 . 5 Â   Â   Â   Â   5 Â   Â   other operating ( income ) expense , net Â   Â   Â   ( 39 . 6 ) Â   Â   Â   19 Â   Â   total operating costs and expenses Â   Â   Â   4 , 582 . 0 Â   Â   Â   Â   7 Â   Â   operating income Â   Â   Â   1 , 964 . 6 Â   Â   Â   Â   8 Â   Â   interest expense Â   Â   Â   128 . 9 Â   Â   Â   Â   7 Â   Â   nonoperating ( income ) expense , net Â   Â   Â   ( 11 . 8 ) Â   Â   Â   n / m Â   Â   income before provision for income taxes Â   Â   Â   1 , 847 . 5 Â   Â   Â   Â   9 Â   Â   provision for income taxes Â   Â   Â   580 . 8 Â   Â   Â   Â   19 Â   Â   net income Â   Â   $ 1 , 266 . 7 Â   Â   Â   Â   5 Â   Â   earnings per common share-basic Â   Â   $ 1 . 24 Â   Â   Â   Â   7 Â   Â   earnings per common share-diluted Â   Â   $ 1 . 23 Â   Â   Â   Â   7 Â   Â   n / m not meaningful Â   15 impact of foreign currency translation while changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results , mcdonald Â ’ s mitigates exposures , where practical , by financing in local currencies , hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows , and purchasing goods and services in local currencies . management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because they believe this better represents the company Â ’ s underlying business trends . results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation ( also referred to as constant currency ) are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates .

Â   Â   Â • Â   in apmea , while the franchised margin dollars increased for the quarter resulting from positive comparable sales , the margin percent decreased primarily due to the 2012 change in classification of certain amounts from revenues to restaurant occupancy expenses in australia . although the change in classification results in a decrease to the franchised margin percentage , there is no impact on the reported franchised margin dollars . company-operated margin dollars increased $ 41 . 8 million or 6 % ( 7 % in constant currencies ) for the quarter .

Â ” they reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report . we do not undertake to update them . our expectations ( or the underlying assumptions ) may change or not be realized , and you should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements . our business and execution of our strategic plan , the plan to win , are subject to risks . the most important of these is whether we can remain relevant to our customers and a brand they trust . meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment . the ieo segment of the restaurant industry , although largely mature in our major markets , is highly fragmented and competitive . the ieo segment has been contracting in many markets , including some major markets , due to unfavorable economic conditions , and this is expected to continue for the remainder of the year . persistently high unemployment rates in many markets have also increased consumer focus on value and heightened pricing sensitivity . combined with pressure on commodity , labor and occupancy costs , these circumstances affect restaurant sales and are expected to continue to pressure margins during 2012 in all operating segments , despite the strength of our brand and value proposition . we have the added challenge of the cultural , economic and regulatory differences that exist within and among the more than 100 countries where we operate . initiatives we undertake may not have universal appeal among different segments of our customer base and can drive unanticipated changes in guest counts and customer perceptions . our operations , plans and results are also affected by regulatory and similar initiatives around the world , notably the focus on nutritional content and the production , processing and preparation of food Â “ from field to front counter , Â ” as well as industry marketing practices . Â   21 these risks can have an impact both in the near- and long-term and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance . our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales and profits depends largely on how well we execute the plan to win . the plan to win addresses the key drivers of our business and results Â — people , products , place , price and promotion . the quality of our execution depends mainly on the following : Â   Â   Â • Â   our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to trends or other factors that affect the ieo segment and our competitive position in the diverse markets we serve , such as spending patterns , demographic changes , trends in food preparation , consumer preferences and publicity about us , all of which can drive popular perceptions of our business or affect the willingness of other companies to enter into site , supply or other arrangements or alliances with us ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the risks associated with our franchise business model , including whether our franchisees and developmental licensees will have the experience and financial resources to be effective operators and remain aligned with us on operating , promotional and capital-intensive initiatives and the potential impact on us if they experience food safety or other operational problems or project a brand image inconsistent with our values , particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited by law or otherwise , costly to exercise or subject to litigation ; Â   Â   Â • Â   our ability to drive restaurant improvements that achieve optimal capacity , particularly during peak mealtime hours , and to motivate our restaurant personnel and our franchisees to achieve consistency and high service levels so as to improve consumer perceptions of our ability to meet expectations for quality food served in clean and friendly environments ; Â   Â   Â • Â   whether we can complete our restaurant reimaging and rebuilding plans as and when projected and whether we are able to identify and develop restaurant sites consistent with our plans for net growth of systemwide restaurants , as well as sales and profitability targets ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the costs and risks associated with our increasing reliance on information technology ( including our point-of-sale and other in-store technology systems or platforms ) , including the risk that we will not realize fully the benefits of our investments in technology , which we are accelerating , as well as the potential for system failures , programming errors , breaches of security involving our systems or those of third-party operators of our systems and the risks of litigation , depending on the scope , nature and enforceability of our rights and obligations under contracts relating to information technology ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the success of our initiatives to support menu choice , physical activity and nutritional awareness and to address these and other matters of social responsibility in a way that communicates our values effectively and inspires trust and confidence ; Â   Â   Â • Â   our ability to respond effectively to adverse perceptions about the quick-service category of the ieo segment or about our products ( including their nutritional content ) , promotions and premiums , such as happy meals ( collectively , our products ) , how we source the commodities we use , and our ability to manage the potential impact on mcdonald Â ’ s of food-borne illnesses or product safety issues ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the impact of social media and other mobile communications or photo applications that can be used to promote adverse perceptions of our operations or those of our suppliers , or to promote or threaten boycotts or other actions involving us or our suppliers , with significantly greater speed and scope than traditional media outlets ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the success of our tiered approach to menu offerings and our ability to introduce new offerings , as well as the impact of our competitors Â ’ actions , including in response to our menu changes , and our ability to continue robust menu development and manage the complexity of our restaurant operations ; Â   Â   Â • Â   our ability to differentiate the mcdonald Â ’ s experience in a way that balances consumer value with margin expansion , particularly in markets where pricing or cost pressures are significant or have been exacerbated by the current challenging economic and operating environment ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the impact of pricing , marketing and promotional plans on sales and margins and our ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly to changing economic and competitive conditions ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the impact of events such as boycotts or protests , labor strikes and supply chain interruptions ( including due to lack of supply or price increases ) that can adversely affect us directly or adversely affect vendors , franchisees and others that are also part of the mcdonald Â ’ s system and whose performance has a material impact on our results ; Â   Â   Â • Â   our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel to manage our operations and growth , particularly in certain developing markets ; and Â   Â   Â • Â   our ability to leverage promotional or operating successes in individual markets into other markets in a timely and cost-effective way . Â   22 our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions , and the current challenging economic environment can be expected to continue to pressure our results . our results of operations are substantially affected by economic conditions , both globally and in local markets , and conditions can vary substantially by market . unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market or daypart ( e . g . , breakfast ) . to mitigate the impact of these conditions , we may take promotional or other actions that adversely affect our margins , limit our operating flexibility or result in charges or restaurant closings . some macroeconomic conditions have an even more wide-ranging and prolonged impact . the current global environment has been characterized by weak economies , persistently high unemployment rates , inflationary pressures and volatility in financial markets . concerns about the ongoing eurozone sovereign debt issues continue to affect both europe and world markets . widespread austerity measures in europe are expected to continue to adversely affect consumer confidence , purchasing power and spending . this environment has also adversely affected business confidence and spending , and uncertainty about the long-term investment environment could further depress capital investment and economic activity . these unfavorable conditions are expected to persist for the remainder of the year . the key factors that can affect our operations , plans and results in this environment are the following : Â   Â   Â • Â   whether our strategies will be effective in enabling the continued market share gains that we have included in our plans , while at the same time enabling us to achieve our targeted operating income growth despite the current adverse economic conditions , resurgent competitors and a more costly and competitive advertising environment ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and sufficient product supply on favorable terms ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the impact on consumer disposable income levels and spending habits of governmental actions to manage national economic matters , whether through austerity or stimulus measures and initiatives intended to control wages , unemployment , credit availability , inflation , taxation and other economic drivers ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the impact on restaurant sales and margins of volatility in commodity and gasoline prices , which we expect will continue and may be exacerbated by developments involving the middle east , and the effectiveness of pricing , hedging and other actions that we , franchisees and suppliers may take to address this environment ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the impact on our margins of labor costs given our labor-intensive business model , the long-term trend toward higher wages in both mature and developing markets and any potential impact of union organizing efforts ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the impact of foreign exchange and interest rates on our financial condition and results ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the challenges and uncertainties associated with operating in developing markets , which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability , economic volatility , crime , corruption and social and ethnic unrest , all of which are exacerbated in many cases by a lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainties in how local law is applied and enforced , including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets , including decisions that result in impairment charges that reduce our earnings ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the increasing focus on workplace practices and conditions , which may drive changes in practices or in the general commercial and regulatory environment that affect perceptions of our business or our cost of doing business ; and Â   Â   Â • Â   the impact of changes in our debt levels on our credit ratings , interest expense , availability of acceptable counterparties , ability to obtain funding on favorable terms or our operating or financial flexibility , especially if lenders impose new operating or financial covenants . increasing legal and regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways . our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance , litigation and similar risks that affect our operations and results in material ways . in many of our markets , including the united states and europe , we are subject to increasing regulation , which has increased our cost of doing business . in developing markets , we face the risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems . among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face and must manage are the following : Â   Â   Â • Â   the cost , compliance and other risks associated with the often conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations we face , especially in the united states where inconsistent standards imposed by local , state and federal authorities can adversely affect popular perceptions of our business and increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the impact of new , potential or changing regulation that can affect our business plans , such as those relating to marketing and the content and safety of our food and other products , as well as the risks and costs of our labeling and other disclosure practices , particularly given varying legal requirements and practices for testing and disclosure within our industry , ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants , and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from third-party suppliers ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the impact of nutritional , health and other scientific inquiries and conclusions , which constantly evolve and often have contradictory implications , but nonetheless drive popular opinion , litigation and regulation , including taxation , in ways that could be material to our business ; Â   23 Â   Â • Â   the risks and costs to us , our franchisees and our supply chain of increased focus by u . s . and overseas governmental and non-governmental organizations on sustainability matters , such as climate change , land use , energy and water resources , and animal welfare ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the impact of litigation trends , particularly in our major markets , including class actions , labor , employment and personal injury claims , franchisee litigation , landlord / tenant disputes and intellectual property claims ( including often aggressive or opportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems ) ; the relative level of our defense costs , which vary from period to period depending on the number , nature and procedural status of pending proceedings ; the cost and other effects of settlements or judgments , which may require us to make disclosures or take other actions that may affect perceptions of our brand and products ; and the scope and terms of insurance or indemnification protections that we may have ; Â   Â   Â • Â   adverse results of pending or future litigation , including litigation challenging the composition of our products , or the appropriateness or accuracy of our marketing or other communication practices ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the increasing costs and other effects of compliance with u . s . and overseas regulations affecting our workforce and labor practices , including regulations relating to wage and hour practices , workplace conditions , immigration , healthcare , retirement and other employee benefits and unlawful workplace discrimination ; Â   Â   Â • Â   disruptions in our operations or price volatility in a market that can result from governmental actions , such as price , foreign exchange or import-export controls , increased tariffs or government-mandated closure of our or our vendors Â ’ operations , and the cost and disruption of responding to governmental investigations or proceedings , whether or not they have merit ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the legal and compliance risks and costs associated with privacy , consumer protection and other laws , the potential costs arising from alleged security breaches ( including the loss of consumer confidence that may result and the risk of criminal penalties or civil liability to consumers or employees whose data is alleged to have been collected or used inappropriately ) and potential challenges to the related intellectual property rights or to our use of that intellectual property ; and Â   Â   Â • Â   the impact of changes in financial reporting requirements , accounting principles or practices , including with respect to our critical accounting estimates , changes in tax accounting or tax laws ( or related authoritative interpretations ) , particularly if corporate tax reform becomes a key component of budgetary initiatives in the united states and elsewhere , and the impact of settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by the irs or other taxing authorities in connection with our tax audits , all of which will depend on their timing , nature and scope . the trading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many factors . many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects . the most important of these , some of which are outside our control , are the following : Â   Â   Â • Â   the continuing unfavorable global economic and extremely volatile market conditions ; Â   Â   Â • Â   governmental action or inaction in light of key indicators of economic activity or events that can significantly influence financial markets , particularly in the united states which is the principal trading market for our common stock , and media reports and commentary about economic or other matters , even when the matter in question does not directly relate to our business ; Â   Â   Â • Â   changes in financial or tax reporting and accounting principles or practices that materially affect our reported financial condition and results and investor perceptions of our performance ; Â   Â   Â • Â   trading activity in our common stock or trading activity in derivative instruments with respect to our common stock or debt securities , which can reflect market commentary ( including commentary that may be unreliable or incomplete in some cases ) or expectations about our business , our creditworthiness or investor confidence generally ; actions by shareholders and others seeking to influence our business strategies ; portfolio transactions in our stock by significant shareholders ; or trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which mcdonald Â ’ s may be included , such as the s & p 500 index and the dow jones industrial average ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the impact of our stock repurchase program or dividend rate ; and Â   Â   Â • Â   the impact on our results of other corporate actions , such as those we may take from time to time as part of our continuous review of our corporate structure in light of business , legal and tax considerations . our results and prospects can be adversely affected by events such as severe weather conditions , natural disasters , hostilities and social unrest , among others . severe weather conditions , natural disasters , hostilities and social unrest , terrorist activities , health epidemics or pandemics ( or expectations about them ) can adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels or other factors that affect our results and prospects , such as commodity costs . our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to certain of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully .
