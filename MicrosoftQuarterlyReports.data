OVERVIEW
The following management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2012 and our financial statements and accompanying Notes to Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.
Microsoft is a technology leader focused on helping people and businesses throughout the world realize their full potential. We create technology that transforms the way people work, play, and communicate across a wide range of computing devices.
We generate revenue by developing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products, by offering an array of services, including cloud-based services to consumers and businesses, by designing and selling hardware that integrates with our cloud-based services, and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees, designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services, and income taxes.
Industry Trends
Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to anticipate the changing demands of customers, industry trends, and competitive forces.
Key Opportunities and Investments
We invest research and development resources in new products and services in the areas where we see significant opportunities to drive future growth. As we look forward, the capabilities and accessibility of PCs, tablets, phones, televisions, and other devices powered by rich software platforms and applications continue to grow. With this trend, we believe the full potential of software will be seen and felt in how people use these devices and the associated services at work and in their personal lives.
Devices with end-user services
We work with an ecosystem of partners to deliver a broad spectrum of Windows devices. In some cases, we build our own devices, as we have chosen to do with Xbox and Surface. In all our work with partners and on our own devices, we focus on delivering seamless services and experiences across devices. As consumer services and hardware advance, we expect they will continue to better complement one another, connecting the devices people use daily to unique communications, productivity, and entertainment services from Microsoft and our partners and developers around the world.

Windows 8 reflects this shift. Launched in October 2012 on a variety of state-of-the-art hardware, Windows 8 is built to take advantage of our consumer cloud services. Windows 8 is made for both personal and professional use and unites the light, thin, and convenient aspects of a tablet with the power of a PC. For example, Xbox Music, Video, Games, and SmartGlass applications make it possible to select and experience entertainment across a range of devices by simplifying and increasing the accessibility of those experiences. SkyDrive, our cloud storage solution, connects content across all of a user’s devices. Bing’s search technologies in Windows 8 are designed to help users get more done. Skype has a new Windows 8 application and connects directly to the new Office.
The new Office is designed for Windows 8 and takes advantage of new mobile form factors with touch and pen capabilities. It unlocks new experiences for reading, note taking, meetings, and communications and brings social experiences directly into productivity and collaboration scenarios. The combination of a Windows 8 tablet with OneNote and SkyDrive will transform how to take notes, annotate documents, and share information.
Services for the enterprise
Today, businesses face important opportunities and challenges. Enterprise IT departments are asked to deploy technology that drives business strategy forward. They decide what solutions will make employees more productive, collaborative, and satisfied. They work to unlock business insights from a world of data. At the same time, they must manage and secure corporate information that employees access across a growing number of personal and corporate devices.
To address these opportunities, businesses look to our world-class business applications like Microsoft Dynamics, Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Lync, and our business intelligence solutions. They rely on our technology to manage employee corporate identity and to protect their corporate data. And, increasingly, businesses of all sizes are looking to Microsoft to realize the benefits of the cloud.
Helping businesses move to the cloud is one of our largest opportunities. Cloud-based solutions provide customers with software, services, and content over the Internet by way of shared computing resources located in centralized data centers. The shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale: larger data centers can deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; larger data centers can coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds. Because of the improved economics, the cloud offers unique levels of elasticity and agility that enable new solutions and applications. For businesses of all sizes, the cloud creates the opportunity to focus on innovation while leaving non-differentiating activities to reliable and cost-effective providers.
Unique to Microsoft, we continue to design and deliver cloud solutions that allow our customers to use both the cloud and their on-premise assets however best suits their own needs. For example, a company can choose to deploy Office or Microsoft Dynamics on premises, as a cloud service, or a combination of both. With Windows Server 2012, Windows Azure, and System Center infrastructure, businesses can deploy applications in their own datacenter, a partner’s datacenter, or in Microsoft’s datacenter with common security, management, and administration across all environments, with the flexibility and scale they desire. Our business customers tell us these hybrid capabilities are critical to harnessing the power of the cloud so they can reach new levels of efficiency and tap new areas of growth.
Our future opportunity
There are several distinct areas of technology that we are focused on driving forward. Our goal is to lead the industry in these areas over the long-term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth well into the future. We are investing significant resources in:
 
  •   
Developing new form factors that have increasingly natural ways to use them, including touch, gesture, and speech.

 
  •   
Making technology more intuitive and able to act on our behalf, instead of at our command, with machine learning.

 
  •   
Building and running cloud services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals.

  •   
Firmly establishing our Windows platform across the PC, tablet, phone, server, and cloud to drive a thriving ecosystem of developers, unify the cross-device user experience, and increase agility when bringing new advances to market.

 
  •   
Delivering new scenarios with improvements in how people learn, work, play, and interact with one another.

We believe the breadth of our devices and services portfolio, our large, global partner and customer base, and the growing Windows ecosystem position us to be a leader in these areas.
Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks
As discussed above, our industry is dynamic and highly competitive. We must anticipate changes in technology and business models. Our model for growth is based on our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new markets, both in terms of geographies and product areas, and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market.
We prioritize our investments among the highest long-term growth opportunities. These investments require significant resources and are multi-year in nature. The products and services we bring to market may be developed internally, brought to market as part of a partnership or alliance, or through acquisition.
Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. Microsoft competes for talented individuals worldwide by offering broad customer reach, scale in resources, and competitive compensation.
Demand for our software, services, and hardware has a strong correlation to global macroeconomic factors. The current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic. See a discussion of these factors and other risks under Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A. of this Form 10-Q).
Seasonality
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Entertainment and Devices Division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, the Entertainment and Devices Division has generated approximately 40% of its yearly segment revenue in our second fiscal quarter.
Unearned Revenue
Quarterly and annual revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue. See the discussions below regarding revenue deferred on: sales of Windows 7 with an option to upgrade to Windows 8 Pro at a discounted price (the “Windows Upgrade Offer”); sales of the previous version of the Microsoft Office system with a guarantee to be upgraded to the new Office at minimal or no cost (the “Office Upgrade Offer”) and pre-sales of the new Office to OEMs and retailers before general availability (“Office Pre-Sales”) (collectively, the “Office Deferral”); and on sales of video games with the right to receive specified software upgrades/enhancements (the “Video Game Deferral”).

Microsoft Business Division (“MBD”) develops and markets software and online services designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. MBD offerings include the Microsoft Office system (comprising mainly Office, SharePoint, Exchange, Lync, and Office 365), which generates over 90% of MBD revenue, and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions. We evaluate MBD results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business revenue, which includes Microsoft Office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and Microsoft Dynamics revenue; and consumer revenue, which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and OEM revenue.
Three months ended March 31, 2013 compared with three months ended March 31, 2012
MBD revenue increased, due to overall increased sales of the Microsoft Office system, as well as the recognition of $101 million of revenue related to Office Pre-Sales and a net $92 million of revenue related to the Office Upgrade Offer. Business revenue increased $477 million or 10%, reflecting growth in multi-year volume licensing revenue and a 13% increase in Microsoft Dynamics revenue. Consumer revenue was flat, reflecting the recognition of revenue related to the Office Deferral, offset in part by the impact on revenue of a decline in the x86 PC market.
MBD revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2013 included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $114 million.
MBD operating income increased, due mainly to revenue growth, offset in part by higher sales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $126 million or 13%, primarily due to increased advertising, fees paid to third-party software advisors, and cross-platform marketing activities.
Nine months ended March 31, 2013 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2012
MBD revenue decreased, due to the deferral of a net $784 million of revenue related to the Office Upgrade Offer, offset in part by overall increased sales of the Microsoft Office system. Business revenue increased $816 million or 6%, reflecting growth in multi-year volume licensing revenue and an 11% increase in Microsoft Dynamics revenue. Consumer revenue decreased $1.1 billion or 32%, driven by the deferral of revenue related to the Office Upgrade Offer and the impact on revenue of a decline in the x86 PC market.
MBD revenue for the nine months ended March 31, 2013 included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $336 million.
MBD operating income decreased, due mainly to lower revenue and higher sales and marketing expenses, offset in part by lower research and development expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $98 million or 3%, primarily due to higher fees paid to third-party software advisors and increased advertising. Research and development expenses decreased $76 million or 5%, primarily due to the capitalization of certain Microsoft Office system software development costs, offset in part by increased headcount-related expenses.

EDD revenue increased, due to higher Windows Phone and Skype revenue, offset in part by lower Xbox 360 platform revenue. Windows Phone revenue increased $948 million, including patent licensing revenue and higher sales of Windows Phone licenses. Xbox 360 platform revenue decreased $864 million or 13%, due mainly to lower volumes of consoles sold, offset in part by higher Xbox LIVE revenue. We shipped 8.9 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first nine months of fiscal year 2013, compared with 11.9 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first nine months of fiscal year 2012.
EDD operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth, lower sales and marketing expenses, and lower cost of revenue, offset in part by higher research and development expenses. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $126 million or 15%, primarily reflecting decreased Xbox 360 platform marketing. Cost of revenue decreased $117 million or 2%, due mainly to lower sales of Xbox 360 consoles, offset in part by payments made to Nokia related to joint strategic initiatives and increased royalties on Xbox LIVE content. Research and development expenses increased $351 million or 32%, primarily reflecting higher headcount-related expenses.

Corporate-level expenses increased, due to higher legal charges from a European Commission fine of €561 million (approximately $733 million) for failure to comply with our 2009 agreement to display a “Browser Choice Screen” on Windows PCs where Internet Explorer is the default browser (the “EU fine”). Corporate-level expenses also increased due to higher intellectual property licensing costs and retail stores expenses.

We use derivative instruments to: manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; enhance investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense). Other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) into other income (expense).
Three months ended March 31, 2013 compared with three months ended March 31, 2012
Net losses on derivatives decreased, due to lower losses on foreign currency derivatives used to hedge foreign currency revenues.
Nine months ended March 31, 2013 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2012
Net recognized gains on investments decreased, primarily due to lower gains on sales of equity and fixed-income securities, offset in part by lower other-than-temporary impairments. Net losses on derivatives decreased, due mainly to gains on commodity and equity derivatives in the current period as compared to losses in the comparable period. For the nine months ended March 31, 2013, other includes a gain recognized upon the divestiture of our 50% share in the MSNBC joint venture.
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate was approximately 20% for both the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, and 19% and 20% for the nine months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our effective tax rate was lower than the

Table of Contents

PART I
Item 2
 
U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico, which have lower income tax rates.
The effective tax rate for three months ended March 31, 2013 was unchanged from the three months ended March 31, 2012. The tax effect of the EU fine, which is not tax deductible, was offset primarily by the favorable impact of earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions. The effective tax rate was lower for the nine months ended March 31, 2013 as compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2012, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our foreign tax provisions, offset in part by the tax effect of the EU fine.
Tax contingencies and other tax liabilities were $9.1 billion and $7.6 billion as of March 31, 2013 and June 30, 2012, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. This increase primarily relates to transfer pricing developments in certain foreign tax jurisdictions. While we settled a portion of the I.R.S. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for those years. In February 2012, the I.R.S. withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of March 31, 2013, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have a significant impact on our financial statements if not resolved favorably. We do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months because we do not believe the remaining open issues will be resolved within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to examination by the I.R.S. for tax years 2007 to 2012.
We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2012, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our financial statements.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments
Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $74.5 billion as of March 31, 2013, compared with $63.0 billion as of June 30, 2012. Equity and other investments were $11.2 billion as of March 31, 2013, compared with $9.8 billion as of June 30, 2012. Our short-term investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. While we own certain mortgage-backed and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of March 31, 2013 does not contain material direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. The majority of our mortgage-backed securities is collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carries a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and Government National Mortgage Association.
We routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign borrowers and counterparties. Our gross exposures to our customers and investments in Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain are individually and collectively not material.
Of the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at March 31, 2013, approximately $66 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects. The amount of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was approximately $970 million. As of March 31, 2013, approximately 85% of the cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in U.S. government and agency securities, approximately 6% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of U.S. companies, and 2% were invested in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, all of which are denominated in U.S. dollars.
Securities lending
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Our securities lending payable

balance was $564 million as of March 31, 2013. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the three months ended March 31, 2013 were $404 million and $632 million, respectively. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the nine months ended March 31, 2013 were $474 million and $1.4 billion, respectively. Intra-quarter variances in the amount of securities loaned are due mainly to fluctuations in the demand for the securities.
Valuation
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and U.S. government securities. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. agency securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.
A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.
Cash Flows
Cash flows from operations decreased $1.0 billion to $22.9 billion for the nine months ended March 31, 2013, due mainly to changes in working capital, including increases in inventory and other current assets. Cash used in financing decreased $308 million to $6.7 billion, due mainly to $2.2 billion in proceeds from issuance of debt, offset in part by an $870 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock, an $827 million increase in dividends paid, and a $319 million increase in cash used for common stock repurchases. Cash used in investing decreased $2.2 billion to $18.0 billion, due mainly to an $8.0 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies and intangible and other assets, offset in part by a $4.8 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases, maturities, and sales and a $780 million increase in cash used for additions to property and equipment.
Debt
We issued debt in prior periods to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used to partially fund discretionary business acquisitions, share repurchases, and other general corporate purposes.
As of March 31, 2013, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $14.2 billion and $15.0 billion, respectively. This is compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of $11.9 billion and $13.2 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2012. These estimated fair values are based on Level 2 inputs.

In November 2012, we issued $2.25 billion of debt securities. The notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding.

Interest on the notes is paid semi-annually. As of March 31, 2013, the aggregate unamortized discount for our long-term debt, including the current portion, was $55 million.
Notes
The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding.
Convertible debt
In June 2010, we issued $1.25 billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on June 15, 2013 in a private placement offering. Proceeds from the offering were $1.24 billion, net of fees and expenses, which were capitalized. Initially, each $1,000 principal amount of notes was convertible into 29.94 shares of Microsoft common stock at a conversion price of $33.40 per share. The conversion ratio is adjusted periodically for dividends in excess of the initial dividend threshold as defined in the debt agreement. As of March 31, 2013, the net carrying amount of our convertible debt was $1.25 billion and the unamortized discount was $4 million.
The notes are convertible at any time. If converted, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election.
Because the convertible debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash, we are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods. The net proceeds of $1.24 billion were allocated between debt for $1.18 billion and stockholders’ equity for $58 million with the portion in stockholders’ equity representing the fair value of the option to convert the debt.

In connection with issuance of the notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates. The capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the notes. Under the capped call transactions, we purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with an initial cap price equal to $37.16, which is adjusted periodically to mirror any adjustments to the conversion price. The purchased capped calls were valued at $40 million and recorded in stockholders’ equity.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue at March 31, 2013 comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. Unearned revenue at March 31, 2013 also included payments for: post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; Xbox LIVE subscriptions and prepaid points; the Office Upgrade Offer deferral; Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products; Skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; OEM minimum commitments; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. In evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. These obligations did not have a material impact on our financial statements during the periods presented.
Other Planned Uses of Capital
We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.
Liquidity
We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, as discussed above under Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments, the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments is held by foreign subsidiaries. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, such as business acquisitions and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or dilution of our earnings. We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates.
RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE
Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance
In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. The new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity determines that this is the case, it is required to perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit (if any). If an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. We adopted this new guidance beginning July 1, 2012. Adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income. The new guidance eliminated the option to report OCI and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity. Instead, an entity is required to present either a continuous statement of net income and OCI or in two separate but consecutive statements. We adopted this new guidance beginning July 1, 2012. Adoption of this new guidance resulted only in changes to presentation of our financial statements.

Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted
In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity’s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. The new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed, and the related net exposure. In January 2013, the FASB clarified that the scope of this guidance applies to derivatives, including bifurcated embedded derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement, or similar agreements. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2013. Other than requiring additional disclosures, we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption.
In February 2013, the FASB issued guidance on disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of AOCI. This new guidance requires entities to present (either on the face of the income statement or in the notes) the effects on the line items of the income statement for amounts reclassified out of AOCI. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2013. Other than requiring additional disclosures, we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption.
In March 2013, the FASB issued guidance on a parent’s accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity. This new guidance requires that the parent release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2014. We do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and stock-based compensation.
Revenue Recognition
Software revenue recognition requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value exists for those elements. A portion of revenue may be recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, and the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.
Windows 7 revenue is subject to deferral as a result of the Windows Upgrade Offer, which started June 2, 2012. The offer provides significantly discounted rights to purchase Windows 8 Pro to qualifying end-users that purchase Windows 7 PCs during the eligibility period. Microsoft is responsible for delivering Windows 8 Pro to the end customer. Accordingly, revenue related to the allocated discount for undelivered Windows 8 is deferred until it is delivered or the redemption period expires.
Microsoft Office system revenue is subject to deferral as a result of the Office Upgrade Offer, which started October 19, 2012. The Office Upgrade Offer allows customers who purchase qualifying 2010 Microsoft Office system or Office for Mac 2011 products to receive, at no cost, a one-year subscription to Office 365 Home Premium or the equivalent version of 2013 Microsoft Office system upon general availability. Small business customers in applicable markets will also be eligible for a three-month trial of Office 365 Small Business Premium. Accordingly, estimated revenue related to the undelivered 2013 Microsoft Office system and subscription services is deferred until the products and services are delivered or the redemption period expires.

Impairment of Investment Securities
We review investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
Goodwill
We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.
The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.
Research and Development Costs
Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.
Legal and Other Contingencies
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements.

Income Taxes
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.

OVERVIEW
The following management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2012 and our financial statements and accompanying Notes to Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.
Microsoft is a technology leader focused on helping people and businesses throughout the world realize their full potential. We create technology that transforms the way people work, play, and communicate across a wide range of computing devices.
We generate revenue by developing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products, by offering an array of services, including cloud-based services to consumers and businesses, by designing and selling hardware that integrates with our cloud-based services, and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees, designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services, and income taxes.
Industry Trends
Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to anticipate the changing demands of customers, industry trends, and competitive forces.
Key Opportunities and Investments
We invest research and development resources in new products and services in the areas where we see significant opportunities to drive future growth. As we look forward, the capabilities and accessibility of PCs, tablets, phones, televisions, and other devices powered by rich software platforms and applications continue to grow. With this trend, we believe the full potential of software will be seen and felt in how people use these devices and the associated services at work and in their personal lives.
Devices with End-User Services
We work with an ecosystem of partners to deliver a broad spectrum of Windows devices. In some cases, we build our own devices, as we have chosen to do with Xbox and Surface. In all our work with partners and on our own devices, we focus on delivering seamless services and experiences across devices. As consumer services and hardware advance, we expect they will continue to better complement one another, connecting the devices people use daily to unique communications, productivity, and entertainment services from Microsoft and our partners and developers around the world.

Windows 8 reflects this shift. Launched in October 2012 on a variety of state-of-the-art hardware, Windows 8 is built to take advantage of our consumer cloud services. Windows 8 is made for both personal and professional use and unites the light, thin, and convenient aspects of a tablet with the power of a PC. For example, Xbox Music, Video, Games, and SmartGlass applications make it possible to select and experience entertainment across a range of devices by simplifying and increasing the accessibility of those experiences. SkyDrive, our cloud storage solution, connects content across all of a user’s devices. Bing’s search technologies in Windows 8 are designed to help users get more done. Skype has a new Windows 8 application and connects directly to the new Office.
The new Office is designed for Windows 8 and takes advantage of new mobile form factors with touch and pen capabilities. It unlocks new experiences for reading, note taking, meetings, and communications and brings social experiences directly into productivity and collaboration scenarios. The combination of a Windows 8 tablet with OneNote and SkyDrive will transform how to take notes, annotate documents, and share information.
Services for the Enterprise
Today, businesses face important opportunities and challenges. Enterprise IT departments are asked to deploy technology that drives business strategy forward. They decide what solutions will make employees more productive, collaborative, and satisfied. They work to unlock business insights from a world of data. At the same time, they must manage and secure corporate information that employees access across a growing number of personal and corporate devices.
To address these opportunities, businesses look to our world-class business applications like Microsoft Dynamics, Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Lync, and our business intelligence solutions. They rely on our technology to manage employee corporate identity and to protect their corporate data. And, increasingly, businesses of all sizes are looking to Microsoft to realize the benefits of the cloud.
Helping businesses move to the cloud is one of our largest opportunities. Cloud-based solutions provide customers with software, services, and content over the Internet by way of shared computing resources located in centralized data centers. The shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale: larger data centers can deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; larger data centers can coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds. Because of the improved economics, the cloud offers unique levels of elasticity and agility that enable new solutions and applications. For businesses of all sizes, the cloud creates the opportunity to focus on innovation while leaving non-differentiating activities to reliable and cost-effective providers.
Unique to Microsoft, we continue to design and deliver cloud solutions that allow our customers to use both the cloud and their on-premise assets however best suits their own needs. For example, a company can choose to deploy Office or Microsoft Dynamics on premises, as a cloud service, or a combination of both. With Windows Server 2012, Windows Azure, and System Center infrastructure, businesses can deploy applications in their own datacenter, a partner’s datacenter, or in Microsoft’s datacenter with common security, management, and administration across all environments, with the flexibility and scale they desire. Our business customers tell us these hybrid capabilities are critical to harnessing the power of the cloud so they can reach new levels of efficiency and tap new areas of growth.
Our Future Opportunity
There are several distinct areas of technology that we are focused on driving forward. Our goal is to lead the industry in these areas over the long term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth well into the future. We are investing significant resources in:
 
  •   
Developing new form factors that have increasingly natural ways to use them, including touch, gestures, and speech.

 
  •   
Making technology more intuitive and able to act on our behalf, instead of at our command, with machine learning.

 
  •   
Building and running cloud services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals.

  •   
Firmly establishing our Windows platform across the PC, tablet, phone, server, and cloud to drive a thriving ecosystem of developers, unify the cross-device user experience, and increase agility when bringing new advances to market.

 
  •   
Delivering new scenarios with improvements in how people learn, work, play, and interact with one another.

We believe the breadth of our devices and services portfolio, our large, global partner and customer base, and the growing Windows ecosystem position us to be a leader in these areas.
Economic Conditions, Challenges and Risks
As discussed above, our industry is dynamic and highly competitive. We must anticipate changes in technology and business models. Our model for growth is based on our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new markets, both in terms of geographies and product areas, and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market.
At Microsoft, we prioritize our investments among the highest long-term growth opportunities. These investments require significant resources and are multi-year in nature. The products and services we bring to market may be developed internally, brought to market as part of a partnership or alliance, or through acquisition.
Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. Microsoft competes for talented individuals worldwide by offering broad customer reach, scale in resources, and competitive compensation.
Demand for our software, services, and hardware has a strong correlation to global macroeconomic factors. The current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic. See a discussion of these factors and other risks under Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A. of this Form 10-Q).
Seasonality
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Entertainment and Devices Division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, the Entertainment and Devices Division has generated approximately 40% of its yearly segment revenue in our second fiscal quarter.
Unearned Revenue
Quarterly and annual revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue. See the discussions below regarding revenue deferred on: sales of Windows 7 with an option to upgrade to Windows 8 Pro at a discounted price (the “Windows Upgrade Offer”) and pre-sales of Windows 8 to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and retailers before general availability (“Windows 8 Pre-Sales”) (collectively, the “Windows Deferral”); sales of the current version of the Microsoft Office system with a guarantee to be upgraded to the new Office at minimal or no cost (the “Office Upgrade Offer”) and pre-sales of the new Office to OEMs and retailers before general availability (“Office Pre-Sales”) (collectively, the “Office Deferral”); and on sales of video games with the right to receive specified software upgrades/enhancements (the “Video Game Deferral”).

Three months ended December 31, 2012 compared with three months ended December 31, 2011
Revenue increased, primarily due to the launch of Windows 8 and Surface on October 26, 2012, and strong sales of Server and Tools products and services, offset in part by lower Entertainment and Devices revenue. During the three months ended December 31, 2012, we recognized a net $622 million of revenue related to the Windows Deferral, and we deferred a net $788 million of revenue related to the Office Deferral and $380 million of revenue related to the Video Game Deferral.
Operating income decreased, reflecting higher operating expenses, offset in part by revenue growth. Key changes in operating expenses were:
 
  •   
Sales and marketing expenses increased $547 million or 15%, primarily reflecting advertising of Windows 8 and Surface.

 
  •   
Research and development expenses increased $157 million or 7%, due mainly to higher headcount-related expenses, primarily related to the Entertainment and Devices Division.

Six months ended December 31, 2012 compared with six months ended December 31, 2011
Revenue decreased, primarily due to the deferral of certain Office, Windows, and video game revenue and lower Entertainment and Devices revenue, offset in part by strong sales of Server and Tools products and services and the launch of Windows 8 and Surface. During the six months ended December 31, 2012, we deferred $977 million of revenue related to the Office Deferral, a net $545 million of revenue related to the Windows Deferral, and $380 million of revenue related to the Video Game Deferral.
Operating income decreased, reflecting lower revenue and increased cost of revenue and operating expenses. Key changes in cost of revenue and operating expenses were:
 
  •   
Sales and marketing expenses increased $592 million or 9%, primarily reflecting advertising of Windows 8 and Surface.

 
  •   
Cost of revenue increased $445 million or 5%, reflecting payments made to Nokia related to joint strategic initiatives, higher headcount-related expenses, primarily related to Server and Tools, and increased product costs associated with Surface, offset in part by lower volumes of Xbox 360 consoles sold.

 
  •   
Research and development expenses increased $288 million or 6%, due mainly to higher headcount-related expenses, primarily related to the Entertainment and Devices Division.

Excluding the impact of the Windows Deferral, approximately 65% of total Windows Division revenue comes from Windows operating system software purchased by OEMs, which they pre-install on equipment they sell. The remaining Windows Division revenue is generated by commercial and retail sales of Windows, Surface, PC hardware products, and online advertising.
Three months ended December 31, 2012 compared with three months ended December 31, 2011
Windows Division revenue increased from the prior year, due in part to the recognition of a net $622 million of revenue related to Windows Deferral, as well as due to sales of Surface and Windows 8 upgrades. OEM revenue grew 17%, reflecting the net Windows Deferral recognition and increased demand in our distribution channels, offset in part by a decline in the x86 PC market.
Windows Division operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth, offset in part by higher sales and marketing expenses and cost of revenue. Sales and marketing expenses increased $420 million or 49%, reflecting advertising costs associated with the launch of Windows 8 and Surface. Cost of revenue increased $293 million or 58%, including product costs associated with Surface and Windows 8 and Windows 8 upgrade support costs.
Six months ended December 31, 2012 compared with six months ended December 31, 2011
Windows Division revenue decreased from the prior year, due in part to the deferral of a net $545 million of revenue related to the Windows Upgrade Offer, as well as due to a decline in the x86 PC market and continued higher relative growth in emerging markets, where average selling prices are lower than developed markets. The revenue decrease was offset in part by sales of Surface and Windows 8 upgrades.
Windows Division operating income decreased, due mainly to lower revenue and higher sales and marketing expenses and cost of revenue. Sales and marketing expenses increased $368 million or 24%, reflecting advertising costs associated with the launch of Windows 8 and Surface. Cost of revenue increased $292 million or 30%, including product costs associated with Surface and Windows 8 and Windows 8 upgrade support costs.

Microsoft Business Division (“MBD”) develops and markets software and online services designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. MBD offerings include the Microsoft Office system (comprising mainly Office, SharePoint, Exchange, Lync, and Office 365), which generates over 90% of MBD revenue, and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions. We evaluate MBD results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business revenue, which includes Microsoft Office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and Microsoft Dynamics revenue; and consumer revenue, which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and OEM revenue.
Three months ended December 31, 2012 compared with three months ended December 31, 2011
MBD revenue decreased, due mainly to the deferral of $689 million of revenue related to the Office Upgrade Offer and $99 million of revenue related to Office Pre-Sales. This decrease was offset in part by overall increased sales of the Microsoft Office system. Business revenue increased $196 million or 4%, primarily reflecting growth in multi-year volume licensing revenue and a 12% increase in Microsoft Dynamics revenue. Consumer revenue decreased $815 million or 67%, driven primarily by the Office Deferral.
MBD revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2012 included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $103 million.
MBD operating income decreased, mainly due to lower revenue.

EDD revenue decreased, primarily due to lower Xbox 360 platform revenue, offset in part by higher Windows Phone revenue. Xbox 360 platform revenue decreased $1.1 billion or 29%, due mainly to lower volumes of consoles sold and lower video game revenue, offset in part by higher Xbox LIVE revenue. We shipped 5.9 million Xbox 360 consoles during the second quarter of fiscal year 2013, compared with 8.2 million Xbox 360 consoles during the second quarter of fiscal year 2012. Video game revenue decreased, primarily due to $380 million of revenue deferred associated with the Video Game Deferral. Windows Phone revenue increased $546 million, including patent licensing revenue and increased sales of Windows Phone licenses.
EDD operating income increased, due mainly to lower cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, offset in part by decreased revenue and increased research and development expenses. Cost of revenue decreased $544 million or 19%, mainly due to decreased sales of Xbox 360 consoles, offset in part by payments made to Nokia related to joint strategic initiatives and increased royalties on Xbox LIVE content and video games. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $92 million or 21%, primarily reflecting decreased Xbox 360 platform marketing. Research and development expenses increased $98 million or 25%, primarily reflecting higher headcount-related expenses.

We use derivative instruments to: manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; enhance investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized in other income (expense). These are generally offset by unrealized gains and losses in the underlying securities in the investment portfolio and are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income.
Three months ended December 31, 2012 compared with three months ended December 31, 2011
Net recognized gains on investments decreased, primarily due to lower gains on sales of equity and fixed-income securities, offset in part by lower other-than-temporary impairments. Net losses on derivatives decreased, due to lower losses on foreign currency derivatives and gains on equity derivatives in the current period as compared to losses in the comparable period, offset in part by losses on commodity and interest-rate derivatives in the current period as compared to gains in the comparable period.
Six months ended December 31, 2012 compared with six months ended December 31, 2011
Net recognized gains on investments decreased, primarily due to lower gains on sales of equity and fixed-income securities, offset in part by lower other-than-temporary impairments. Net losses on derivatives decreased, due to gains on commodity and equity derivatives in the current period as compared to losses in the comparable period, offset in part by higher losses on foreign currency derivatives and lower gains on interest-rate derivatives.

Income Taxes
Our effective tax rates were approximately 18% and 20% for the three months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and 18% and 20% for the six months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico, which have lower income tax rates.
The current quarter effective tax rate is lower than our prior year’s second quarter effective tax rate, primarily due to adjustments to prior year tax provision estimates and a favorable state court ruling. The current year effective tax rate is lower than our prior year effective tax rate, primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our foreign tax provisions.
Tax contingencies and other tax liabilities were $7.7 billion and $7.6 billion as of December 31, 2012 and June 30, 2012, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. While we settled a portion of the I.R.S. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for those years. In February 2012, the I.R.S. withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of December 31, 2012, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have a significant impact on our financial statements if not resolved favorably. We do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months, because we do not believe the remaining open issues will be resolved within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to examination by the I.R.S. for tax years 2007 to 2011.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments
Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $68.3 billion as of December 31, 2012, compared with $63.0 billion as of June 30, 2012. Equity and other investments were $10.7 billion as of December 31, 2012, compared with $9.8 billion as of June 30, 2012. Our short-term investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. While we own certain mortgage-backed and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of December 31, 2012 does not contain material direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. The majority of our mortgage-backed securities is collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carries a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and Government National Mortgage Association.
We routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign borrowers and counterparties. Our gross exposures to our customers and investments in Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain are individually and collectively not material.
Of the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at December 31, 2012, approximately $61 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects. The amount of cash and investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was approximately $579 million. As of December 31, 2012, approximately 84% of the short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in U.S. government and agency securities, approximately 5% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of U.S. companies, and 3% were invested in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, all of which are denominated in U.S. dollars.
Securities lending
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet.

borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Our securities lending payable balance was $21 million as of December 31, 2012. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the three months ended December 31, 2012 were $174 million and $455 million, respectively. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the six months ended December 31, 2012 were $509 million and $1.4 billion, respectively. Intra-quarter variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities.
Valuation
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and U.S. treasuries. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and agency securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.
A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally labeled as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.
Cash Flows
Cash flows from operations decreased $1.1 billion to $13.3 billion for the six months ended December 31, 2012, due mainly to changes in working capital, including increases in inventory and other current assets, offset in part by increased cash collections from customers. Cash used in financing decreased $1.4 billion to $3.9 billion, due mainly to $2.2 billion in proceeds from issuance of debt, offset in part by a $585 million increase in dividends paid and a $314 million increase in cash used for common stock repurchases. Cash used in investing increased $2.4 billion to $10.3 billion, due mainly to a $9.4 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases, maturities, and sales and a $599 million increase in cash used for additions to property and equipment, offset in part by an $8.0 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies and intangible and other assets.
Debt
We issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used to partially fund discretionary business acquisitions, share repurchases, and other general corporate purposes.
As of December 31, 2012, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $14.2 billion and $15.2 billion, respectively. This is compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of $11.9 billion and $13.2 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2012. These estimated fair values are based on Level 2 inputs.

In November 2012, we issued $2.25 billion of debt securities. The notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding.

Interest on the notes is paid semi-annually. As of December 31, 2012, the aggregate unamortized discount for our long-term debt, including the current portion, was $62 million.
Notes
The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding.
Convertible Debt
In June 2010, we issued $1.25 billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on June 15, 2013 in a private placement offering. Proceeds from the offering were $1.24 billion, net of fees and expenses, which were capitalized. Initially, each $1,000 principal amount of notes was convertible into 29.94 shares of Microsoft common stock at a conversion price of $33.40 per share. The conversion ratio is adjusted periodically for dividends in excess of the initial dividend threshold as defined in the debt agreement. As of December 31, 2012, the net carrying amount of our convertible debt was $1.2 billion and the unamortized discount was $9 million.
Prior to March 15, 2013, the notes will be convertible, only in certain circumstances, into cash and, if applicable, cash, shares of Microsoft’s common stock, or a combination thereof, at our election. On or after March 15, 2013, the notes will be convertible at any time. Upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election.
Because the convertible debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash, we are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods. The net proceeds of $1.24 billion were allocated between debt for $1.18 billion and stockholders’ equity for $58 million with the portion in stockholders’ equity representing the fair value of the option to convert the debt.

In connection with issuance of the notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates. The capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the notes. Under the capped call transactions, we purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with an initial cap price equal to $37.16, which is adjusted periodically to mirror any adjustments to the conversion price. The purchased capped calls were valued at $40 million and recorded to stockholders’ equity.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue at December 31, 2012 comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. Unearned revenue at December 31, 2012 also included payments for: the Windows Upgrade Offer; post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; the Office Deferral; Xbox LIVE subscriptions and prepaid points; the Video Game Deferral; Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products; Skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; OEM minimum commitments; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.
The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2012:

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. In evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. These obligations did not have a material impact on our financial statements during the periods presented.
Other Planned Uses of Capital
We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.
Liquidity
We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, as discussed above under Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments, the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments is held by foreign subsidiaries. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, such as business acquisitions and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or dilution of our earnings. We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates.
RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE
Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance
In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. The new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity determines that this is the case, it is required to perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit (if any). If an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. We adopted this new guidance beginning July 1, 2012. Adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income. The new guidance eliminated the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity. Instead, an entity is required to present either a continuous statement of net income and other comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The new guidance also required entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented. This guidance was amended in December 2011 when the FASB issued guidance which indefinitely defers presentation of reclassification adjustments. We adopted this new amended guidance beginning July 1, 2012. Adoption of this new amended guidance resulted only in changes to presentation of our financial statements.

Item 2
 
Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted
In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity’s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. The new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed, and the related net exposure. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2013. Other than requiring additional disclosures, we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and stock-based compensation.
Revenue Recognition
Software revenue recognition requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value exists for those elements. A portion of revenue may be recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, and the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.
Windows 7 revenue is subject to deferral as a result of the Windows Upgrade Offer, which started June 2, 2012. The offer provides significantly discounted rights to purchase Windows 8 Pro to qualifying end-users that purchase Windows 7 PCs during the eligibility period. Microsoft is responsible for delivering Windows 8 Pro to the end customer. Accordingly, revenue related to the allocated discount for undelivered Windows 8 is deferred until it is delivered or the redemption period expires.
Microsoft Office system revenue is subject to deferral as a result of the Office Upgrade Offer, which started October 19, 2012. The Office Upgrade Offer allows customers who purchase qualifying 2010 Microsoft Office system or Office for Mac 2011 products to receive, at no cost, a one-year subscription to Office 365 Home Premium or the equivalent version of 2013 Microsoft Office system upon general availability. Small business customers in applicable markets will also be eligible for a three-month trial of Office 365 Small Business Premium. Accordingly, estimated revenue related to the undelivered 2013 Microsoft Office system and subscription services is deferred until the products and services are delivered or the redemption period expires.
Impairment of Investment Securities
We review investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
Goodwill
We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative

PART I
Item 2
 
fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.
The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.
Research and Development Costs
Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.
Legal and Other Contingencies
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements.
Income Taxes
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.

OVERVIEW
The following management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2012 and our financial statements and accompanying Notes to Financial Statements.
Microsoft is a technology leader focused on helping people and businesses throughout the world realize their full potential. We create technology that transforms the way people work, play, and communicate across a wide range of computing devices.
We generate revenue by developing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products, by offering an array of services, including cloud-based services to consumers and businesses, by designing and selling hardware that integrates with our cloud-based services, and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees, designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services, and income taxes.
Industry Trends
Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to anticipate the changing demands of customers, industry trends, and competitive forces.
Key Opportunities and Investments
We invest research and development resources in new products and services in the areas where we see significant opportunities to drive future growth. As we look forward, the capabilities and accessibility of PCs, tablets, phones, televisions, and other devices powered by rich software platforms and applications continue to grow. With this trend we believe the full potential of software will be seen and felt in how people use these devices and the associated services at work and in their personal lives.
Devices with End-User Services
We work with an ecosystem of partners to deliver a broad spectrum of Windows devices. In some cases we build our own devices, as we have chosen to do with Xbox and the recently announced Surface. In all our work with partners and on our own devices, we focus on delivering seamless services and experiences across devices. As consumer services and hardware advance, we expect they will continue to better complement one another, connecting the devices people use daily to unique communications, productivity, and entertainment services from Microsoft and our partners and developers around the world.

Windows 8 reflects this shift. Coming to market on October 26, 2012 on a variety of state-of-the-art hardware, Windows 8 is built to take advantage of our consumer cloud services. Windows 8 is made for both personal and professional use and unites the light, thin, and convenient aspects of a tablet with the power of a PC. For example, Xbox Music, Video, Games, and SmartGlass applications make it possible to select and experience entertainment across a range of devices by simplifying and increasing the accessibility of entertainment experiences. SkyDrive, our cloud storage solution, connects content across all of a user’s devices. Bing’s search technologies in Windows 8 is designed to help users get more done. Skype has a new Windows 8 application and connects directly into the new Office.
The new Office was designed for Windows 8 and takes advantage of new mobile form factors with touch and pen capabilities. It unlocks new experiences for reading, note taking, meetings, and communications and brings social experiences directly into productivity and collaboration scenarios. The combination of a Windows 8 tablet with OneNote and SkyDrive will transform how to take notes, annotate documents, and share information.
Services for the Enterprise
Today, businesses face important opportunities and challenges. Enterprise IT departments are asked to deploy technology that drives business strategy forward. They decide what solutions will make employees more productive, collaborative, and satisfied. They work to unlock business insights from a world of data. At the same time, they must manage and secure corporate information that employees access across a growing number of personal and corporate devices.
To address these opportunities, businesses look to our world-class business applications like Microsoft Dynamics, Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Lync, and our business intelligence solutions. They rely on our technology to manage employee corporate identity and to protect their corporate data. And, increasingly, businesses of all sizes are looking to Microsoft to realize the benefits of the cloud.
Helping businesses move to the cloud is one of our largest opportunities. Cloud-based solutions provide customers with software, services, and content over the Internet by way of shared computing resources located in centralized data centers. The shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale: larger data centers can deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; larger data centers can coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds. Because of the improved economics, the cloud offers unique levels of elasticity and agility that enable new solutions and applications. For businesses of all sizes, the cloud creates the opportunity to focus on innovation while leaving non-differentiating activities to reliable and cost-effective providers.
Unique to Microsoft, we continue to design and deliver cloud solutions that allow our customers to move to leverage both the cloud and their on-premise assets. For example, a company can choose to deploy Office or Microsoft Dynamics on premises, as a cloud service, or a combination of both. With Windows Server 2012, Windows Azure and System Center infrastructure, businesses can deploy applications in their own datacenter, a partner’s datacenter, or in Microsoft’s datacenter with common security, management, and administration across all environments, with the flexibility and scale they desire. Our business customers tell us these hybrid capabilities are critical to harnessing the power of the cloud so they can reach new levels of efficiency and tap new areas of growth.
Our Future Opportunity
There are several distinct areas of technology that we are focused on driving forward. Our goal is to lead the industry in these areas over the long term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth well into the future. We are investing significant resources in:
 
  •   
Developing new form factors that have increasingly natural ways to use them, including touch, gestures, and speech.

 
  •   
Making technology more intuitive and able to act on our behalf, instead of at our command, with machine learning.

  •   
Building and running cloud services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals.

 
  •   
Firmly establishing our Windows platform across the PC, tablet, phone, server, and cloud to drive a thriving ecosystem of developers, unify the cross-device user experience, and increase agility when bringing new advances to market.

 
  •   
Delivering new scenarios with improvements in how people learn, work, play, and interact with one another.

We believe the breadth of our devices and services portfolio, our large, global partner and customer base, and the growing Windows ecosystem position us to be a leader in these areas.
Economic Conditions, Challenges and Risks
As discussed above, our industry is dynamic and highly competitive. We must anticipate changes in technology and business models. Our model for growth is based on our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new markets, both in terms of geographies and product areas, and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market.
At Microsoft, we prioritize our investments among the highest long-term growth opportunities. These investments require significant resources and are multi-year in nature. The products and services we bring to market may be developed internally, brought to market as part of a partnership or alliance, or through acquisition.
Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. Microsoft competes for talented individuals worldwide by offering broad customer reach, scale in resources, and competitive compensation.
Demand for our software, services, and hardware has a strong correlation to global macroeconomic factors. The current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic. See a discussion of these factors and other risks under Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A. of this Form 10-Q).
Seasonality
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Entertainment and Devices Division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, the Entertainment and Devices Division has generated approximately 40% of its yearly segment revenue in our second fiscal quarter.
Unearned Revenue
Quarterly and annual revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue. See the discussions below regarding revenue deferred on sales of the current version of the Microsoft Office system with a guarantee to be upgraded to the newest version of the Microsoft Office system at minimal or no cost (the “Office Deferral”), and on sales of Windows 7 with an option to upgrade to Windows 8 Pro at a discounted price upon general availability (“the Windows Upgrade Offer”) and pre-sales of Windows 8 to original equipment manufacturers and retailers before general availability (“Windows 8 Pre-Sales”) (collectively, the “Windows Deferral”).

Revenue decreased mainly due to the deferral of $1.2 billion of revenue related to the Windows Deferral and $189 million of revenue primarily related to the Office Deferral, as well as due to lower Xbox 360 entertainment platform revenue, offset in part by strong sales of Server and Tools products and services. Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2012 also included revenue for Skype, which was acquired October 13, 2011.
Operating income decreased reflecting lower revenue and increased cost of revenue and research and development expenses. Cost of revenue increased $391 million or 10%, primarily due to payments made to Nokia related to joint strategic initiatives and higher headcount-related expenses, primarily related to the Server and Tools Business. Research and Development expenses increased $131 million or 6%, due mainly to higher headcount-related expenses, primarily related to the Entertainment and Devices Division, as well as increased lab and localization costs.

Windows & Windows Live Division (“Windows Division”) develops and markets PC operating systems, related software and online services, and PC hardware products. This collection of software, hardware, and services is designed to simplify everyday tasks through seamless operations across the user’s hardware and software and efficient browsing capabilities. Windows Division offerings consist of the Windows operating system, software and services through Windows Live, and Microsoft PC hardware products.
Excluding the impact of the Windows Deferral, approximately 75% of total Windows Division revenue comes from Windows operating system software purchased by original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) which they pre-install on equipment they sell. The remaining approximately 25% of Windows Division revenue is generated by commercial and retail sales of Windows and PC hardware products and online advertising from Windows Live.
Windows Division revenue decreased from the prior year, due mainly to the deferral of $783 million of revenue related to Windows 8 Pre-Sales and $384 million of revenue related to the Windows Upgrade Offer. Windows Division revenue was also negatively impacted by a decline in the PC market, decreased inventory levels within distribution channels as OEMs and retailers began to prepare for the Windows 8 launch, and continued higher relative growth in emerging markets, where average selling prices are lower than developed markets.
Windows Division operating income decreased, due mainly to lower revenue. Operating expenses were impacted by higher research and development expenses, which were offset by lower sales and marketing expenses. Research and development expenses increased $43 million or 10%, primarily associated with Windows 8 and Surface. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $51 million or 8%, reflecting decreased corporate marketing activities, offset in part by increased advertising of Windows.

Server and Tools develops and markets technology and related services that enable information technology professionals and their systems to be more productive and efficient. Server and Tools product and service offerings include Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Windows Azure, Visual Studio, System Center products, Windows Embedded device platforms, and Enterprise Services. Enterprise Services comprise Premier product support services and Microsoft Consulting Services. We also offer developer tools, training, and certification. Approximately 80% of Server and Tools revenue comes from volume licensing programs, retail packaged product and licenses sold to OEMs, and the remainder comes from Enterprise Services.
Server and Tools revenue increased in both product sales and Enterprise Services. Product revenue increased $215 million or 6%, driven primarily by growth in SQL Server, System Center, and Developer Tools, reflecting continued adoption of the Windows platform. Enterprise Services revenue grew $121 million or 13%, due to growth in both Premier product support and consulting services.
Server and Tools revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2012 included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $77 million.
Server and Tools operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth, offset in part by higher cost of revenue and increased sales and marketing expenses. Cost of revenue increased $110 million or 12%, primarily reflecting higher headcount-related costs. Sales and marketing expenses grew $48 million or 5%, reflecting increased corporate marketing activities and fees paid to third-party enterprise software advisors.

Online Services Division (“OSD”) develops and markets information and content designed to help people simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, and to help advertisers connect with audiences. OSD offerings include Bing, Bing Ads, MSN, and advertiser tools. Bing and MSN generate revenue through the sale of search and display advertising, accounting for nearly all of OSD’s annual revenue.
Online advertising revenue grew $83 million or 15% to $655 million, reflecting continued growth in search advertising revenue, offset in part by decreased display advertising revenue. Search revenue grew due to increased revenue per search, increased volumes reflecting general market growth, and share gains in the U.S. According to third-party sources, Bing organic U.S. market share for the month of September 2012 was approximately 16%, and grew 120 basis points year over year. Bing-powered U.S. market share, including Yahoo! properties, was approximately 25% for the month of September 2012, down 160 basis points year over year.
OSD’s operating loss was reduced by higher revenue and lower cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, offset in part by higher research and development expenses. Cost of revenue decreased $91 million, driven by lower Yahoo! reimbursement costs and traffic acquisition costs. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $40 million or 23%, due mainly to decreased corporate marketing activities. Research and development expenses increased $32 million or 10%, primarily reflecting higher headcount-related expenses.

Microsoft Business Division (“MBD”) develops and markets software and online services designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. MBD offerings include the Microsoft Office system (comprising mainly Office, SharePoint, Exchange, Lync, and Office 365), which generates over 90% of MBD revenue, and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions. We evaluate MBD results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business revenue, which includes Microsoft Office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and Microsoft Dynamics revenue; and consumer revenue, which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and OEM revenue.
MBD revenue decreased, mainly reflecting $189 million of revenue deferred primarily related to the Office Deferral, offset in part by overall increased sales of the 2010 Microsoft Office system. Business revenue increased $142 million or 3%, primarily reflecting growth in multi-year volume licensing revenue and a 6% increase in Microsoft Dynamics revenue. Consumer revenue decreased $275 million or 25% driven by the Office Deferral and a decline in the PC market.
MBD revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2012 included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $119 million.
MBD operating income decreased, mainly due to lower revenue, offset in part by decreased research and development expenses. Research and development expenses decreased $64 million or 13%, primarily due to the capitalization of certain Microsoft Office system software development costs, offset in part by increased headcount-related expenses.

EDD offerings include the Xbox 360 entertainment platform (which includes the Xbox 360 gaming and entertainment console, Kinect for Xbox 360, Xbox 360 video games, Xbox LIVE, and Xbox 360 accessories), Mediaroom (our Internet protocol television software), Skype, and Windows Phone, including related patent licensing revenue. We acquired Skype on October 13, 2011, and its results of operations from that date are reflected in our results discussed below.
EDD revenue decreased slightly, mostly due to lower Xbox 360 platform revenue, offset in part by Skype and Windows Phone revenue. Xbox 360 platform revenue decreased $418 million or 24%, due mainly to lower volumes of consoles sold and lower video game revenue, offset in part by higher Xbox LIVE revenue. We shipped 1.7 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, compared with 2.3 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. Video game revenue decreased primarily due to the release of Gears of War 3 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 with no comparable major releases in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013.
EDD operating income decreased, due mainly to higher cost of revenue and research and development expenses. Cost of revenue grew $151 million or 14%, largely due to payments made to Nokia related to joint strategic initiatives and due to the acquisition of Skype, offset in part by decreased sales of Xbox 360 consoles and lower video game royalties. Research and development expenses increased $140 million or 44%, primarily reflecting higher headcount-related expenses related to interactive entertainment and the acquisition of Skype.

Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized in other income (expense). These are generally offset by unrealized gains and losses in the underlying securities in the investment portfolio and are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income.

Other income increased primarily due to a gain recognized upon the divestiture of our 50% share in the MSNBC joint venture on July 13, 2012. Dividends and interest income decreased due to lower yields on our investments, offset in part by higher average portfolio investment balances. Net recognized gains on investments decreased, primarily due to higher other-than-temporary impairments, offset in part by gains on sales of equity and fixed-income securities. Net gains on derivatives decreased due to losses on foreign exchange contracts in the current period as compared to gains in the comparable period, offset in part by gains on commodity derivatives in the current period as compared to losses in the comparable period. Changes in foreign currency remeasurements were primarily due to currency movements net of our hedging activities.
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rates were approximately 19% and 21% for the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico, which have lower income tax rates.
The current quarter’s effective tax rate is lower than our prior year’s first quarter effective tax rate primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our foreign tax provisions.
Tax contingencies and other tax liabilities were $7.8 billion and $7.6 billion as of September 30, 2012 and June 30, 2012, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. While we settled a portion of the I.R.S. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for these years. In February 2012, the I.R.S. withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of September 30, 2012, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have a significant impact on our financial statements if not resolved favorably. We do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months, as we do not believe the remaining open issues will be resolved within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to examination by the I.R.S. for tax years 2007 to 2011.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments
Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $66.6 billion as of September 30, 2012, compared with $63.0 billion as of June 30, 2012. Equity and other investments were $10.0 billion as of September 30, 2012 compared to $9.8 billion as of June 30, 2012. Our short-term investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. While we own certain mortgage-backed and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of September 30, 2012 does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. The majority of our mortgage-backed securities is collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carries a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and Government National Mortgage Association.
We routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign borrowers and counterparties. Our gross exposures to our customers and investments in Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain are individually and collectively not material.
Of the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at September 30, 2012, approximately $58 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and were subject to material repatriation tax effects. The amount of cash and investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was approximately $668 million. As of September 30, 2012, approximately 83% of the short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in U.S. government and agency securities, approximately 7% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of U.S. companies, and 3% were invested in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, all of which are denominated in U.S. dollars.

Securities lending
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Our securities lending payable balance was $415 million as of September 30, 2012. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the three months ended September 30, 2012 were $845 million and $1.4 billion, respectively. Intra-quarter variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities.
Valuation
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and U.S. treasuries. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and agency securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.
A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally labeled as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.
Cash Flows
Cash flows from operations remained flat at $8.5 billion due to increased cash collections from customers, largely offset by other changes in working capital. Cash used in financing decreased $155 million to $2.7 billion, due mainly to a $302 million decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases and a $107 million increase in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, partially offset by a $335 million increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing increased $5.4 billion to $7.7 billion, due mainly to a $4.6 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, a $333 million increase in cash used for securities lending, and a $270 million increase in cash used for acquisition of companies and purchases of intangible assets.

We issued debt in prior periods to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were used to partially fund discretionary business acquisitions and share repurchases.
As of September 30, 2012, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $12.0 billion and $13.3 billion, respectively. This is compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of $11.9 billion and $13.2 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2012. These estimated fair values are based on Level 2 inputs.

Interest on the notes is paid semi-annually. As of September 30, 2012, the aggregate unamortized discount for our long-term debt, including the current portion, was $50 million.
Notes
The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding.
Convertible Debt
In June 2010, we issued $1.25 billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on June 15, 2013 in a private placement offering. Proceeds from the offering were $1.24 billion, net of fees and expenses, which were capitalized. Initially, each $1,000 principal amount of notes was convertible into 29.94 shares of Microsoft common stock at a conversion price of $33.40 per share. The conversion ratio is adjusted periodically for dividends in excess of the initial dividend threshold as defined in the debt agreement. As of September 30, 2012, the net carrying amount of our convertible debt was $1.2 billion and the unamortized discount was $14 million.
Prior to March 15, 2013, the notes will be convertible, only in certain circumstances, into cash and, if applicable, cash, shares of Microsoft’s common stock, or a combination thereof, at our election. On or after March 15, 2013, the notes will be convertible at any time. Upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election.
Because the convertible debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash, we are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods. The net proceeds of $1.24 billion were allocated between debt for $1.18 billion and stockholders’ equity for $58 million with the portion in stockholders’ equity representing the fair value of the option to convert the debt.
In connection with the issuance of the notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates. The capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the notes. Under the capped call transactions, we purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with an initial cap price equal to $37.16, which is adjusted periodically to mirror any adjustments to the conversion price. The purchased capped calls were valued at $40 million and recorded to stockholders’ equity.

Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue at September 30, 2012 comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. Unearned revenue at September 30, 2012 also included payments for: the Windows Deferral; post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; Xbox LIVE subscriptions and prepaid points; OEM minimum commitments; Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products; Skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; the Office Deferral; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. In evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued in our financial statements any liabilities related to these indemnifications.

Other Planned Uses of Capital
We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.
Liquidity
We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, as discussed above under Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments, the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments is held by foreign subsidiaries. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, such as business acquisitions and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or dilution of our earnings. We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates.
RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE
Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance
In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. The new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity determines that this is the case, it is required to perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit (if any). If an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. We adopted this new guidance beginning July 1, 2012. Adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income. The new guidance eliminated the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity. Instead, an entity is required to present either a continuous statement of net income and other comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The new guidance also required entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented. This guidance was amended in December 2011 when the FASB issued guidance which indefinitely defers presentation of reclassification adjustments. We adopted this new amended guidance beginning July 1, 2012. Adoption of this new amended guidance resulted only in changes to presentation of our financial statements.
Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted
In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity’s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. The new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed, and the related net exposure. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2013. Other than requiring additional disclosures, we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and stock-based compensation.
Revenue Recognition
Software revenue recognition requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value exists for those elements. A portion of revenue may be recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, and the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.
Windows 7 revenue is subject to deferral as a result of the Windows Upgrade Offer, which started June 2, 2012. The offer provides significantly discounted rights to purchase Windows 8 Pro to qualifying end-users that purchase Windows 7 PCs during the eligibility period. Microsoft is responsible for delivering Windows 8 Pro to the end customer. Accordingly, revenue related to the allocated discount for undelivered Windows 8 is deferred until it is delivered or the redemption period expires.
Microsoft Office system revenue is subject to deferral as a result of the Office Offer, which will start on October 19, 2012. The Office Offer allows customers who purchase qualifying 2010 Microsoft Office system or Office for Mac 2011 products to receive, at no cost, a one-year subscription to Office 365 Home Premium or the equivalent version of 2013 Microsoft Office system upon general availability. Small business customers in applicable markets will also be eligible for a three-month trial of Office 365 Small Business Premium. Accordingly, estimated revenue related to the undelivered 2013 Microsoft Office system and subscription services is deferred until the products and services are delivered or the redemption period expires.
Impairment of Investment Securities
We review investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
Goodwill
We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.

Item 2
 
The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.
Research and Development Costs
Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.
Legal and Other Contingencies
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements.
Income Taxes
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.

OVERVIEW
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2011 and our financial statements and accompanying Notes to Financial Statements.
Microsoft is a technology leader focused on helping people and businesses throughout the world realize their full potential. We create technology that transforms the way people work, play, and communicate across a wide range of computing devices.
We generate revenue by developing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products and services, by designing and selling hardware, and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global customer audience. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees, designing, manufacturing, marketing and selling our products and services, and income taxes.
Industry Trends
Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas which can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad set of research and technology innovations that seek to anticipate the changing demands of customers, industry trends, and competitive forces.
Key Opportunities and Investments
Based on our assessment of key technology trends and our broad focus on long-term research and development of new products and services, we see significant opportunities to drive future growth.
Smart connected devices
The price per unit of processing, storage, and networks continues to decline while at the same time devices increase in capability. As a result, the capabilities and accessibility of PCs, mobile, and other devices powered by rich software platforms and applications continue to grow. At the same time, the information and services people use increasingly span multiple devices. User experiences will be transformed by the adoption of cloud computing when brought together with the richness of smart, connected devices. Microsoft is delivering experiences that seamlessly connect PCs and mobile and other devices through the cloud. We are devoting significant resources to consumer cloud offerings like Bing, Windows Live, and Xbox LIVE. Our software and hardware platform investments can be seen in products like Kinect, Windows, Windows Azure, Windows Phone, Windows Server, and Xbox.

Cloud computing transforming the data center and information technology
Cloud-based solutions provide customers with software, services and content over the Internet by way of shared computing resources located in centralized data centers. Computing is undergoing a long-term shift from client/server to the cloud, a shift similar in importance and impact to the transition from mainframe to client/server. The shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale: larger data centers can deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; larger data centers can coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns which can improve the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds. As a result of the improved economics, the cloud offers unique levels of elasticity and agility that will enable new solutions and applications. For businesses of all sizes, the cloud creates the opportunity to focus more on innovation while leaving non-differentiating activities to reliable and cost-effective providers. For many businesses, the first step in achieving cloud economics is the adoption of virtualization in their data center. We are devoting significant resources to developing cloud infrastructure, platforms, and applications including offerings such as Microsoft Dynamics Online, Microsoft SQL Azure, Office 365, Windows Azure, Windows Intune, and Windows Server.
Entertainment
The evolution of hardware, software, services, and the cloud are enhancing the delivery and quality of unified entertainment experiences across many devices. These rich media experiences include games, movies, music, television, and social interactions with family, friends, and colleagues. At Microsoft, our approach is to simplify and increase the accessibility of these entertainment experiences to broaden market penetration of our software and services. We invest significant resources to develop or partner to develop hardware, software, and content that is used in products and services such as Windows Phone, Xbox, Xbox LIVE, and Skype.
Search
Over the last two decades, web content and social connections have increased dramatically as people spend more time online, while discoverability and accessibility has been transforming from direct navigation and document links. There is significant opportunity to deliver differentiated products that helps users make better decisions and complete tasks more simply when using PC, mobile, and other devices. Our approach is to use machine learning to try to understand user intent, and differentiate our product by focusing on the integration of visual, social, and other elements which simplifies people’s interaction with the Internet. We invest significant resources in Bing, SharePoint, Windows, Windows Phone, and Xbox LIVE.
Communications and productivity
Personal and business productivity has been transformed by the ubiquity of computing and software tools. Over the last decade, Microsoft redefined software productivity beyond the rich Office client on the PC. Productivity scenarios now encompass unified communications, business intelligence, collaboration, content management, and relationship management, which are increasingly powered by server-side applications. These server applications can be hosted by the customer, a partner, or by Microsoft in the cloud. There are significant opportunities to provide productivity and communication scenarios across PCs, mobile devices, and other devices that connect to services. We invest significant resources in Dynamics, Exchange, Lync, Skype, Office, Office 365, SharePoint, Windows Live, and Windows Phone.
Economic Conditions, Challenges and Risks
As discussed above, our industry is dynamic and highly competitive. We must anticipate changes in technology and business models. Our model for growth is based on our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new markets, both in terms of geographies and product areas, and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market.
At Microsoft, we prioritize our investments among the highest long-term growth opportunities. These investments require significant resources and are multi-year in nature. The products and services we bring to market can be built internally, brought to market as part of a partnership or alliance, or through acquisition.
Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We rely on hiring from a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. Microsoft competes for talented individuals worldwide by offering broad customer reach, scale in resources, and competitive compensation.

Demand for our software, services, and hardware has a strong correlation to global macroeconomic factors. The current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic. See a discussion of these factors and other risks under Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A. of this Form 10-Q).
Seasonality
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Entertainment and Devices Division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, the Entertainment and Devices Division has generated approximately 40% of its yearly segment revenue in our second fiscal quarter. In addition, quarterly revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue. See the discussions below regarding sales of earlier versions of the Microsoft Office system with a guarantee to be upgraded to the newest version of the Microsoft Office system at minimal or no cost (the “Office Deferral”).

Three months ended March 31, 2012 compared with three months ended March 31, 2011
Revenue increased primarily due to strong sales of Server and Tools products and services and the 2010 Microsoft Office system, offset in part by a decline in Xbox 360 entertainment platform sales. Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2012 also included Skype revenue.
Operating income increased 12%, primarily reflecting an increase in revenue, offset in part by higher research and development expenses. Research and development expenses increased $248 million or 11%, due mainly to higher headcount-related expenses. Headcount-related expenses increased across the company reflecting a 4% increase in headcount from March 31, 2011 and changes in our employee compensation program.
Diluted earnings per share were $0.60. Prior year net income and diluted earnings per share reflected a partial settlement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“I.R.S.”) and higher other income. The partial settlement with the I.R.S. added $461 million to prior year net income and $0.05 to diluted earnings per share.
Nine months ended March 31, 2012 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2011
Revenue increased primarily due to strong sales of Server and Tools products and services and the 2010 Microsoft Office system. Revenue for the nine months ended March 31, 2012 also included Skype revenue from the date of acquisition.
Operating income increased reflecting increased revenue, offset in part by higher operating expenses. Key changes in operating expenses were:
 
  •   
Cost of revenue increased $1.5 billion or 13%, reflecting higher costs associated with providing Server and Tools products and services, higher Xbox royalty costs, and changes in the mix of products and services sold.

 
  •   
Research and development expenses increased $567 million or 9%, due mainly to higher headcount-related expenses.

 
  •   
General and administrative expenses increased $390 million or 13%, due mainly to higher headcount-related expenses and Puerto Rican excise taxes.

Windows & Windows Live Division (“Windows Division”) develops and markets PC operating systems, related software and online services, and PC hardware products. This collection of software, hardware, and services is designed to simplify everyday tasks through efficient browsing capabilities and seamless operations across the user’s hardware and software. Windows Division offerings consist of multiple editions of the Windows operating system, software and services through Windows Live, and Microsoft PC hardware products.
Windows Division revenue is largely correlated to the PC market worldwide, as approximately 75% of total Windows Division revenue comes from Windows operating system software purchased by original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) which they pre-install on equipment they sell. The remaining approximately 25% of Windows Division revenue is generated by commercial and retail sales of Windows and PC hardware products and online advertising from Windows Live.
Three months ended March 31, 2012 compared with three months ended March 31, 2011
Windows Division revenue reflected relative performance in PC market segments. We estimate that sales of PCs to businesses grew approximately 8% and sales of PCs to consumers were flat. Excluding a decline in sales of netbooks, we estimate that sales of PCs to consumers grew approximately 6%. Taken together, the total PC market increased an estimated 2% to 4%. Windows Division revenue was positively impacted by a higher rate of Windows licensed on PCs shipped and growth in sales to businesses.
Windows Division operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, offset in part by higher research and development expenses, which grew due mainly to an increase in headcount-related costs and product development costs associated with the next version of the Windows operating system.
Nine months ended March 31, 2012 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2011
Windows Division revenue reflected relative performance in PC market segments. We estimate that sales of PCs to businesses grew approximately 5% and sales of PCs to consumers decreased 1%. Excluding a decline in sales of netbooks, we estimate that sales of PCs to consumers grew approximately 6%. Taken together, the total PC market increased an estimated 0% to 2%. Windows Division revenue was negatively impacted by higher growth in emerging markets, where average selling prices are lower, relative to developed markets, partially offset by a higher rate of Windows licensed on PCs shipped and growth in sales to businesses.

Microsoft Business Division (“MBD”) develops and markets software and online services designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. MBD offerings include the Microsoft Office system (comprising mainly Office, SharePoint, Exchange, Lync, and Office 365), which generates over 90% of MBD revenue, and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions. We evaluate MBD results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business revenue, which includes Microsoft Office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and Microsoft Dynamics revenue; and consumer revenue, which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and OEM revenue.
Three months ended March 31, 2012 compared with three months ended March 31, 2011
MBD revenue increased primarily reflecting sales of the 2010 Microsoft Office system. Business revenue increased $469 million or 11%, primarily reflecting growth in multi-year volume licensing revenue, licensing of the 2010 Microsoft Office system to transactional business customers, and an 11% increase in Microsoft Dynamics revenue. Consumer revenue increased $16 million or 2% due mainly to increased sales of the 2010 Microsoft Office system.
MBD revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2012 included a favorable foreign currency impact of $121 million.
MBD operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth. An increase in cost of revenue, which resulted primarily from higher online operation and support costs, was nearly offset by a decrease in sales and marketing expenses, which resulted primarily from lower headcount-related costs.
Nine months ended March 31, 2012 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2011
MBD revenue increased primarily reflecting sales of the 2010 Microsoft Office system. Business revenue increased $1.2 billion or 9%, primarily reflecting growth in multi-year volume licensing revenue, licensing of the 2010 Microsoft Office system to transactional business customers, and a 13% increase in Microsoft Dynamics revenue. Consumer revenue decreased $157 million or 4% due to the recognition of $254 million of revenue in the prior year associated with the Office Deferral. Excluding the impact associated with the Office Deferral, consumer revenue increased $97 million or 3% driven by increased sales of the 2010 Microsoft Office system.
MBD revenue for the nine months ended March 31, 2012 included a favorable foreign currency impact of $458 million.

Entertainment and Devices Division (“EDD”) develops and markets products and services designed to entertain and connect people. EDD offerings include the Xbox 360 entertainment platform (which includes the Xbox 360 gaming and entertainment console, Kinect for Xbox 360, Xbox 360 video games, Xbox LIVE, and Xbox 360 accessories), Mediaroom (our Internet protocol television software), Skype, and Windows Phone, including related patent licensing revenue. In November 2010, we released Kinect for Xbox 360. We acquired Skype on October 13, 2011, and its results of operations from this date are reflected in our results discussed below.
Three months ended March 31, 2012 compared with three months ended March 31, 2011
EDD revenue decreased primarily reflecting lower Xbox 360 platform revenue, offset in part by Skype revenue and Windows Phone software license revenue from Nokia. Xbox 360 platform revenue decreased $584 million or 33%, due mainly to decreased volumes of Xbox 360 consoles and standalone Kinect sensors sold, offset in part by higher Xbox LIVE revenue. We shipped 1.4 million Xbox 360 consoles during the third quarter of fiscal year 2012, compared with 2.7 million Xbox 360 consoles during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011.
EDD operating income decreased reflecting lower revenue, payments made to Nokia related to joint strategic initiatives, and higher other operating expenses. Research and development expenses increased $100 million or 35%, and sales and marketing expenses increased $79 million or 50%, primarily reflecting higher headcount-related expenses. Cost of revenue decreased $80 million or 6% primarily due to lower volumes of Xbox 360 consoles and standalone Kinect sensors sold, offset in part by payments made to Nokia.
Nine months ended March 31, 2012 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2011
EDD revenue increased primarily reflecting Skype revenue and Windows Phone software license revenue from Nokia, offset in part by lower Xbox 360 platform revenue. Xbox 360 platform revenue decreased $154 million or 2%, due mainly to decreased volumes of standalone Kinect sensors sold and lower video game revenue, offset in part by higher Xbox LIVE revenue. We shipped 11.9 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first nine months of fiscal year 2012, compared with 11.9 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first nine months of fiscal year 2011. Video game revenue decreased due to strong sales of Halo Reach in the prior year.
EDD operating income decreased reflecting higher operating expenses, including payments made to Nokia related to joint strategic initiatives, offset in part by revenue growth. Cost of revenue grew $556 million or 12% primarily due to payments made to Nokia and changes in the mix of products and services sold. Research and development expenses increased $228 million or 26%, and sales and marketing expenses increased $179 million or 26%, primarily reflecting higher headcount-related expenses and the inclusion of Skype expenses.

We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized in other income (expense). These are generally offset by unrealized gains and losses in the underlying securities in the investment portfolio and are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income.
Dividends and interest income decreased due to lower yields on our fixed-income investments, offset in part by higher average portfolio investment balances. Interest expense increased due to our increased issuance of debt in the prior year. Net recognized gains on investments decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2012 due primarily to lower net gains on sales of equity securities and higher other-than-temporary impairments. Net recognized gains on investments increased slightly for the nine months ended March 31, 2012 as higher net gains on sales of equity and fixed-income securities were offset by higher other-than-temporary impairments. Other-than-temporary impairments were $82 million and $234 million during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2012, respectively, compared to $15 million and $42 million during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2011, respectively. Net losses on derivatives increased for the three months ended March 31, 2012 due primarily to losses on commodity derivatives in the current period as compared to gains in the comparable period. Net losses on derivatives also increased for the nine months ended March 31, 2012 due primarily to losses on commodity and equity derivatives in the current period as compared to gains in the comparable period. Changes in foreign currency remeasurements were primarily due to currency movements net of our hedging activities.

Income Taxes
Our effective tax rates were approximately 20% and 13% for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and 20% and 21% for the nine months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to a higher mix of earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico, which are subject to lower income tax rates. In addition, there was a settlement of a portion of an I.R.S. audit of tax years 2004 to 2006, which reduced our income tax expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 by $461 million.
Changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries resulted primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our products and services. As discussed above, Windows Division operating income declined $240 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2012, while MBD and Server and Tools operating income increased $723 million and $732 million, respectively, during this same period. We supply Windows, our primary Windows Division product, to customers through our U.S. regional operating center, while we supply the Microsoft Office System, our primary MBD product, and our Server and Tools products to customers through our foreign regional operations centers.
Tax contingencies and other tax liabilities were $7.9 billion and $7.4 billion as of March 31, 2012 and June 30, 2011, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. While we settled a portion of the I.R.S. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for these years. In February 2012, the I.R.S. withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of March 31, 2012, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have a significant impact on our financial statements if not resolved favorably. We believe our reserves are adequate. We do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months, as we do not believe the remaining open issues will be resolved within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to examination by the I.R.S. for tax years 2007 to 2011.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments
Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $59.5 billion as of March 31, 2012, compared with $52.8 billion as of June 30, 2011. Equity and other investments were $9.1 billion as of March 31, 2012 compared to $10.9 billion as of June 30, 2011. Our short-term investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. While we own certain mortgage-backed and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of March 31, 2012 does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. The majority of our mortgage-backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and Government National Mortgage Association.
We routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign borrowers and counterparties. Our gross exposures to our customers and investments in Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain are individually and collectively not material.
Of the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at March 31, 2012, approximately $50 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and were subject to material repatriation tax effects. The amount of cash and investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was approximately $586 million. As of March 31, 2012, approximately 77% of the short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in U.S. government and agency securities, approximately 10% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of U.S. companies, and 4% were invested in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, all of which are denominated in U.S. dollars.

Securities lending
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Our securities lending payable balance was $1.2 billion as of March 31, 2012. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the three months ended March 31, 2012 were $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the nine months ended March 31, 2012 were $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. Intra-quarter variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities.
Valuation
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and U.S. treasuries. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and agency securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.
A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally labeled as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.
Cash Flows
Cash flows from operations increased $2.9 billion to $23.9 billion for the nine months ended March 31, 2012 due mainly to increased revenue and cash collections. Cash used in financing increased $1.0 billion to $7.0 billion due mainly to a $6.0 billion net decrease in proceeds from issuances of debt and an $877 million increase in dividends paid, offset in part by a $6.3 billion decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases. Cash used in investing increased $6.5 billion to $20.1 billion due mainly to a $9.5 billion increase in acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets and a $1.1 billion decrease in cash from securities lending activities, partially offset by a $4.1 billion increase in cash provided by net purchases, maturities, and sales of investments.
Debt
We issued debt in prior periods to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were used to partially fund discretionary business acquisitions and share repurchases.
As of March 31, 2012, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including convertible debt, were $11.9 billion and $13.0 billion, respectively. This is compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of $11.9 billion and $12.1 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2011. The estimated fair value is based on Level 2 inputs.

Notes
The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding.
Convertible Debt
In June 2010, we issued $1.25 billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on June 15, 2013 in a private placement offering. Proceeds from the offering were $1.24 billion, net of fees and expenses, which were capitalized. Each $1,000 principal amount of notes is convertible into 29.94 shares of Microsoft common stock at a conversion price of $33.40 per share. As of March 31, 2012, the net carrying amount of our convertible debt was $1.2 billion and the unamortized discount was $24 million.
Prior to March 15, 2013, the notes will be convertible, only in certain circumstances, into cash and, if applicable, cash, shares of Microsoft’s common stock, or a combination thereof, at our election. On or after March 15, 2013, the notes will be convertible at any time. Upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election.
Because the convertible debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash, we are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods. The net proceeds of $1.24 billion were allocated between debt for $1.18 billion and stockholders’ equity for $58 million with the portion in stockholders’ equity representing the fair value of the option to convert the debt.
In connection with the issuance of the notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates. The capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the notes. Under the capped call transactions, we purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with a cap price equal to $37.16. The purchased capped calls were valued at $40 million and recorded to stockholders’ equity.

Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue at March 31, 2012 comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. Unearned revenue at March 31, 2012 also included payments for: post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; Xbox LIVE subscriptions and prepaid points; Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products; Skype prepaid credit and subscriptions; OEM minimum commitments; unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Windows Phone and of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis for Windows XP; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.
The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of March 31, 2012:

All repurchases were made using cash resources. As of March 31, 2012, approximately $9.2 billion remained of the $40.0 billion approved repurchase amount.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. In evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued in our financial statements any liabilities related to these indemnifications.

Other Planned Uses of Capital
We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.
Definitive Agreement with AOL
On April 9, 2012, Microsoft announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement with AOL Inc. (“AOL”) to acquire over 800 of AOL’s patents and related patent applications and to license on a non-exclusive basis AOL’s retained patent portfolio for $1.1 billion in cash. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of 2012, upon the satisfaction of customary conditions and regulatory approvals.
Liquidity
We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, as discussed above under Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments, the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, such as business acquisitions and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or other dilution of our earnings. We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates.
RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE
Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance
On July 1, 2011, we adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) on disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements. The guidance requires the disclosure of roll-forward activities on purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 fair value measurements). Adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
On January 1, 2012, we adopted guidance issued by the FASB on accounting and disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements. The guidance limits the highest-and-best-use measure to nonfinancial assets, permits certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market or counterparty credit risks to be measured at a net basis, and provides guidance on the applicability of premiums and discounts. Additionally, the guidance expands the disclosures on Level 3 inputs by requiring quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions, as well as description of the valuation processes and the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs. Adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.

Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted
In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity’s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. The new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed, and the related net exposure. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2013. Other than requiring additional disclosures, we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption.
In September 2011, the FASB issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. The new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity determines that this is the case, it is required to perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit (if any). If an entity determines the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2012.
In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income. The new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity. Instead, an entity will be required to present either a continuous statement of net income and other comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. This portion of the guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2012 and will require financial statement presentation changes only. The new guidance also required entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented. However, in December 2011, the FASB issued guidance which indefinitely defers the guidance related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and stock-based compensation.
Revenue Recognition
Software revenue recognition requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value exists for those elements. A portion of revenue may be recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, and the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.
Impairment of Investment Securities
Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.

Goodwill
We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Among our reporting units, the fair value of OSD has been the closest to its carrying value and is most sensitive to changes in assumptions. We will continue to monitor OSD as we complete our annual planning process and evaluate results. We will be conducting our annual goodwill impairment test as of May 1, 2012. As of the date of our most recent goodwill impairment test, May 1, 2011, OSD’s fair value exceeded its carrying value by 21%. The carrying value of OSD’s goodwill was $6.4 billion as of March 31, 2012.
The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.
Research and Development Costs
Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.
Legal and Other Contingencies
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements.
Income Taxes
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements.

Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.

OVERVIEW
The following management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2011 and our financial statements and accompanying Notes to Financial Statements.
Microsoft is a technology leader focused on helping people and businesses throughout the world realize their full potential. We create technology that transforms the way people work, play, and communicate across a wide range of computing devices.
We generate revenue by developing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products and services, by designing and selling hardware, and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global customer audience. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees, designing, manufacturing, marketing and selling our products and services, and income taxes.
Industry Trends
Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas which can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad set of research and technology innovations that seek to anticipate the changing demands of customers, industry trends, and competitive forces.
Key Opportunities and Investments
Based on our assessment of key technology trends and our broad focus on long-term research and development of new products and services, we see significant opportunities to drive future growth.
Smart connected devices
The price per unit of processing, storage, and networks continues to decline while at the same time devices increase in capability. As a result, the capabilities and accessibility of PCs, mobile, and other devices powered by rich software platforms and applications continue to grow. At the same time, the information and services people use increasingly span multiple devices. User experiences will be transformed by the adoption of cloud computing when brought together with the richness of smart, connected devices. Microsoft is delivering experiences that seamlessly connect PCs and mobile and other devices through the cloud. We are devoting significant resources to consumer cloud offerings like Bing, Windows Live, and Xbox LIVE. Our software and hardware platform investments can be seen in products like Kinect, Windows, Windows Azure, Windows Phone, Windows Server, and Xbox.

Cloud computing transforming the data center and information technology
Cloud-based solutions provide customers with software, services and content over the Internet by way of shared computing resources located in centralized data centers. Computing is undergoing a long-term shift from client/server to the cloud, a shift similar in importance and impact to the transition from mainframe to client/server. The shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale: larger data centers can deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; larger data centers can coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns which can improve the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds. As a result of the improved economics, the cloud offers unique levels of elasticity and agility that will enable new solutions and applications. For businesses of all sizes, the cloud creates the opportunity to focus more on innovation while leaving non-differentiating activities to reliable and cost-effective providers. For many businesses, the first step in achieving cloud economics is the adoption of virtualization in their data center. We are devoting significant resources to developing cloud infrastructure, platforms, and applications including offerings such as Microsoft Dynamics Online, Microsoft SQL Azure, Office 365, Windows Azure, Windows Intune, and Windows Server.
Entertainment
The evolution of hardware, software, services, and the cloud are enhancing the delivery and quality of unified entertainment experiences across many devices. These rich media experiences include games, movies, music, television, and social interactions with family, friends, and colleagues. At Microsoft, our approach is to simplify and increase the accessibility of these entertainment experiences to broaden market penetration of our software and services. We invest significant resources to develop or partner to develop hardware, software, and content that is used in products and services such as Windows Phone, Xbox, Xbox LIVE, and Skype.
Search
Over the last two decades, web content and social connections have increased dramatically as people spend more time online, while discoverability and accessibility has been transforming from direct navigation and document links. There is significant opportunity to deliver differentiated products that helps users make better decisions and complete tasks more simply when using PC, mobile, and other devices. Our approach is to use machine learning to try to understand user intent, and differentiate our product by focusing on the integration of visual, social, and other elements which simplifies people’s interaction with the Internet. We invest significant resources in Bing, SharePoint, Windows, Windows Phone, and Xbox LIVE.
Communications and productivity
Personal and business productivity has been transformed by the ubiquity of computing and software tools. Over the last decade, Microsoft redefined software productivity beyond the rich Office client on the PC. Productivity scenarios now encompass unified communications, business intelligence, collaboration, content management, and relationship management, which are increasingly powered by server-side applications. These server applications can be hosted by the customer, a partner, or by Microsoft in the cloud. There are significant opportunities to provide productivity and communication scenarios across PCs, mobile devices, and other devices that connect to services. We invest significant resources in Dynamics, Exchange, Lync, Skype, Office, Office 365, SharePoint, and Windows Live.
Economic Conditions, Challenges and Risks
As discussed above, our industry is dynamic and highly competitive. We must anticipate changes in technology and business models. Our model for growth is based on our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new markets, both in terms of geographies and product areas, and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market.
At Microsoft, we prioritize our investments among the highest long-term growth opportunities. These investments require significant resources and are multi-year in nature. The products and services we bring to market can be built internally, brought to market as part of a partnership or alliance, or through acquisition.
Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We rely on hiring from a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. Microsoft competes for talented individuals worldwide by offering broad customer reach, scale in resources, and competitive compensation.

Demand for our software, services, and hardware has a strong correlation to global macroeconomic factors. The current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic. See a discussion of these factors and other risks under Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A. of this Form 10-Q).
Seasonality
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Entertainment and Devices Division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, the Entertainment and Devices Division has generated approximately 40% of its yearly segment revenue in our second fiscal quarter. In addition, quarterly revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue. See the discussions below regarding sales of earlier versions of the Microsoft Office system with a guarantee to be upgraded to the newest version of the Microsoft Office system at minimal or no cost (the “Office Deferral”).

Windows & Windows Live Division (“Windows Division”) develops and markets PC operating systems, related software and online services, and PC hardware products. This collection of software, hardware, and services is designed to simplify everyday tasks through efficient browsing capabilities and seamless operations across the user’s hardware and software. Windows Division offerings consist of multiple editions of the Windows operating system, software and services through Windows Live, and Microsoft PC hardware products.
Windows Division revenue is largely correlated to the PC market worldwide, as approximately 75% of total Windows Division revenue comes from Windows operating system software purchased by original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) which they pre-install on equipment they sell. The remaining approximately 25% of Windows Division revenue is generated by commercial and retail sales of Windows and PC hardware products and online advertising from Windows Live.
Three months ended December 31, 2011 compared with three months ended December 31, 2010
Windows Division revenue reflected relative performance in PC market segments. We estimate that sales of PCs to businesses grew approximately 2% and sales of PCs to consumers declined approximately 6%. Excluding a decline in sales of netbooks, we estimate that sales of PCs to consumers grew approximately 2%. Taken together, the total PC market decreased an estimated 2% to 4%, including the impact of supply chain issues from the Thailand floods. Windows Division revenue was also negatively impacted by a reduction in inventory levels within our distribution channels as well as by the effect of higher growth in emerging markets, where average selling prices are lower, relative to developed markets, and by lower recognition of previously deferred Windows XP revenue.

Microsoft Business Division (“MBD”) develops and markets software and online services designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. MBD offerings include the Microsoft Office system (comprising mainly Office, SharePoint, Exchange, Lync, and Office 365), which generates over 90% of MBD revenue, and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions. We evaluate MBD results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business revenue, which includes Microsoft Office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and Microsoft Dynamics revenue; and consumer revenue, which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and OEM revenue.
Three months ended December 31, 2011 compared with three months ended December 31, 2010
MBD revenue increased primarily reflecting sales of the 2010 Microsoft Office system. Business revenue increased $420 million or 9%, primarily reflecting growth in multi-year volume licensing revenue, licensing of the 2010 Microsoft Office system to transactional business customers, and an 11% increase in Microsoft Dynamics revenue. Consumer revenue decreased $251 million or 17% due mainly to the recognition of $224 million of revenue in the prior year associated with the Office Deferral. Excluding the impact associated with the Office Deferral, consumer revenue decreased $27 million or 2% due to decreased sales of the 2010 Microsoft Office system.
MBD revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2011 included a favorable foreign currency impact of $131 million.
MBD operating income increased due to revenue growth, offset in part by higher operating expenses. Cost of revenue increased, primarily driven by higher online operation and support costs.
Six months ended December 31, 2011 compared with six months ended December 31, 2010
MBD revenue increased primarily reflecting sales of the 2010 Microsoft Office system. Business revenue increased $742 million or 8%, primarily reflecting growth in multi-year volume licensing revenue, licensing of the 2010 Microsoft Office system to transactional business customers, and a 14% increase in Microsoft Dynamics revenue. Consumer revenue decreased $168 million or 7% due to the recognition of $254 million of revenue in the prior year associated with the Office Deferral. Excluding the impact associated with the Office Deferral, consumer revenue increased $86 million or 4% driven by increased sales of the 2010 Microsoft Office system.
MBD revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2011 included a favorable foreign currency impact of $337 million.
MBD operating income increased due to revenue growth, offset in part by higher operating expenses. Cost of revenue increased, primarily driven by higher online operation and support costs.

Entertainment and Devices Division (“EDD”) develops and markets products and services designed to entertain and connect people. EDD offerings include the Xbox 360 entertainment platform (which includes the Xbox 360 gaming and entertainment console, Kinect for Xbox 360, Xbox 360 video games, Xbox LIVE, and Xbox 360 accessories), Mediaroom (our Internet protocol television software), Skype, and Windows Phone, including related patent licensing revenue. In November 2010, we released Kinect for Xbox 360. We acquired Skype on October 13, 2011.

higher Xbox LIVE revenue, offset in part by lower volumes of standalone Kinect sensors sold. We shipped 8.2 million Xbox 360 consoles during the second quarter of fiscal year 2012, compared with 6.3 million Xbox 360 consoles during the second quarter of fiscal year 2011.
EDD operating income decreased reflecting higher operating expenses, offset in part by revenue growth. Cost of revenue grew $461 million or 19% primarily due to higher volumes of Xbox 360 consoles sold, payments made to Nokia related to joint strategic initiatives, Skype cost of revenue, and higher royalty costs resulting from an increase in Xbox LIVE digital marketplace third-party content sold. Research and development expenses increased $101 million or 37%, primarily reflecting higher headcount-related expenses, including Skype headcount. Sales and marketing expenses increased $94 million or 27%, primarily reflecting higher headcount-related expenses, including Skype headcount, and amortization of acquired Skype intangibles.
Six months ended December 31, 2011 compared with six months ended December 31, 2010
EDD revenue increased primarily reflecting higher Xbox 360 platform revenue as well as Skype revenue from the date of acquisition. Xbox 360 platform revenue grew $430 million or 8%, led by increased volumes of Xbox 360 consoles sold and higher Xbox LIVE revenue, offset in part by lower volumes of standalone Kinect sensors sold and decreased video game revenue. We shipped 10.5 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first half of fiscal year 2012, compared with 9.2 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first half of fiscal year 2011. Video game revenue decreased due to strong sales of Halo Reach in the prior year.
EDD operating income decreased reflecting higher operating expenses, offset in part by revenue growth. Cost of revenue grew $633 million or 19% primarily due to higher royalty costs resulting from an increase in Xbox LIVE digital marketplace third-party content sold and sales of Gears of War 3 and due to payments made to Nokia related to joint strategic initiatives. Research and development expenses increased $125 million or 22%, primarily reflecting higher headcount-related expenses, including Skype headcount.

We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized in other income (expense). These are generally offset by unrealized gains and losses in the underlying securities in the investment portfolio and are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income.
Dividends and interest income decreased slightly due to lower yields on our fixed-income investments, offset in part by higher average portfolio investment balances. Interest expense increased due to our increased issuance of debt. Net recognized gains on investments increased due primarily to higher gains on sales of equity securities, offset in part due to higher other-than-temporary impairments. Other-than-temporary impairments were $107 million and $152 million during the three and six months ended December 31, 2011, respectively, compared to $18 million and $27 million during the three and six months ended December 31, 2010. Net losses on derivatives increased for the three months ended December 31, 2011 due primarily to higher losses on currency contracts used to hedge foreign currency revenue, higher losses on equity derivatives, and lower gains on commodity derivatives. Net losses on derivatives also increased for the six months ended December 31, 2011 due primarily to losses on commodity and equity derivatives in the current period as compared to gains in the comparable period. Changes in foreign currency remeasurements were primarily due to currency movements net of our hedging activities.
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rates were approximately 20% and 22% for the three months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and 20% and 23% for the six months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate and our prior year effective rates primarily due to a higher mix of earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico, which are subject to lower income tax rates.
Changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries resulted primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our products and services. As discussed above, Windows Division operating income declined $401 million for the six months ended December 31, 2011, while MBD and Server and Tools operating income increased $269 million and $345 million, respectively, during this same period. We supply Windows, our primary Windows Division product, to customers through our U.S. regional operating center, while we supply the Microsoft Office System, our primary MBD product, and our Server and Tools products to customers through our foreign regional operations centers.
Tax contingencies and other tax liabilities were $7.7 billion and $7.4 billion as of December 31, 2011 and June 30, 2011, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. While we settled a portion of the I.R.S. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for these years. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, the I.R.S. completed its examination and issued a Revenue Agent’s Report (“RAR”) for the remaining unresolved items. We do not agree with the adjustments in the RAR, and we have filed a protest to initiate the

administrative appeals process. The proposed adjustments are primarily related to transfer pricing and could have a significant impact on our financial statements if not resolved favorably; however, we believe our existing reserves are adequate. We do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months, as we do not believe the appeals process will be concluded within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to examination by the I.R.S. for tax years 2007 to 2011.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments
Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $51.7 billion as of December 31, 2011, compared with $52.8 billion as of June 30, 2011. Equity and other investments were $7.6 billion as of December 31, 2011 compared to $10.9 billion as of June 30, 2011. Our short-term investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. While we own certain mortgage-backed and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of December 31, 2011 does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. The majority of our mortgage-backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and Government National Mortgage Association.
We routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign borrowers and counterparties. Our gross exposures to our customers and investments in Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain are individually and collectively not material.
Of the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at December 31, 2011, approximately $46 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and were subject to material repatriation tax effects. The amount of cash and investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was approximately $410 million. As of December 31, 2011, approximately 65% of the short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in U.S. government and agency securities, approximately 16% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of U.S. companies, and 4% were invested in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, all of which are denominated in U.S. dollars.
Securities lending
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Our securities lending payable balance was $849 million as of December 31, 2011. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the three months ended December 31, 2011 were $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the six months ended December 31, 2011 were $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. Intra-quarter variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities.
Valuation
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and U.S. treasuries. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and agency securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.

Table of Contents

PART I
Item 2
 
A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally labeled as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.
Cash Flows
Cash flows from operations increased $2.0 billion to $14.4 billion for the six months ended December 31, 2011 due mainly to increased revenue and cash collections. Cash used in financing decreased $2.0 billion to $5.4 billion due mainly to a $6.5 billion decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases, offset in part by a $3.7 billion net decrease in proceeds from issuances of debt. Cash used in investing increased $1.4 billion to $7.9 billion due mainly to a $9.4 billion increase in acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets and a $1.5 billion decrease in cash from securities lending activities, partially offset by a $9.5 billion increase in cash provided by net purchases, maturities, and sales of investments.
Debt
We issued debt in prior periods to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were used to partially fund discretionary business acquisitions and share repurchases.
As of December 31, 2011, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including convertible debt, were $11.9 billion and $13.1 billion, respectively. This is compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of $11.9 billion and $12.1 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2011. The estimated fair value is based on quoted prices for our publicly-traded debt as of December 31, 2011 and June 30, 2011, as applicable.
The components of long-term debt, the associated interest rates, and the semi-annual interest record and payment dates were as follows as of December 31, 2011:

Notes
The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding.
Convertible Debt
In June 2010, we issued $1.25 billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on June 15, 2013 in a private placement offering. Proceeds from the offering were $1.24 billion, net of fees and expenses, which were capitalized. Each $1,000 principal amount of notes is convertible into 29.94 shares of Microsoft common stock at a conversion price of $33.40 per share. As of December 31, 2011, the net carrying amount of our convertible debt was $1.2 billion and the unamortized discount was $28 million.
Prior to March 15, 2013, the notes will be convertible, only in certain circumstances, into cash and, if applicable, cash, shares of Microsoft’s common stock, or a combination thereof, at our election. On or after March 15, 2013, the notes will be convertible at any time. Upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election.
Because the convertible debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash, we are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods. The net proceeds of $1.24 billion were allocated between debt for $1.18 billion and stockholders’ equity for $58 million with the portion in stockholders’ equity representing the fair value of the option to convert the debt.
In connection with the issuance of the notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates. The capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the notes. Under the capped call transactions, we purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with a cap price equal to $37.16. The purchased capped calls were valued at $40 million and recorded to stockholders’ equity.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue at December 31, 2011 comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. Unearned revenue at December 31, 2011 also included payments for: post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; Xbox LIVE subscriptions and prepaid points; Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products; Skype prepaid credit and subscriptions; OEM minimum commitments; unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Windows Phone and of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis for Windows XP; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.
The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2011:

Share Repurchases
During the three and six months ended December 31, 2011, we repurchased approximately 39 million and 78 million shares of Microsoft common stock for $1.0 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, under the repurchase plan we announced on September 22, 2008. All repurchases were made using cash resources. As of December 31, 2011, approximately $10.2 billion remained of the $40.0 billion approved repurchase amount. The repurchase program expires September 30, 2013 but may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. In evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued in our financial statements any liabilities related to these indemnifications.
Other Planned Uses of Capital
We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.
Liquidity
We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, as discussed above under Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments, the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, such as business acquisitions and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or other dilution of our earnings. We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates.

RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE
Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance
On July 1, 2011, we adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) on disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements. The guidance requires the disclosure of roll-forward activities on purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 fair value measurements). Adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted
In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity’s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. The new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed, and the related net exposure. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2013. Other than requiring additional disclosures, we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption.
In September 2011, the FASB issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. The new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity determines that this is the case, it is required to perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit (if any). If an entity determines the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2012.
In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income. The new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity. Instead, an entity will be required to present either a continuous statement of net income and other comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The new guidance also required entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented. In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance which indefinitely defers the guidance related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2012 and will have financial statement presentation changes only.
In May 2011, the FASB issued guidance to amend the accounting and disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The new guidance limits the highest-and-best-use measure to nonfinancial assets, permits certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market or counterparty credit risks to be measured at a net basis, and provides guidance on the applicability of premiums and discounts. Additionally, the new guidance expands the disclosures on Level 3 inputs by requiring quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions, as well as description of the valuation processes and the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2012. Other than requiring additional disclosures, we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and stock-based compensation.
Revenue Recognition
Software revenue recognition requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value exists for those elements. A portion of revenue may be recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, and the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.

Item 2
 
Impairment of Investment Securities
Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
Goodwill
We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Among our reporting units, the fair value of OSD has been the closest to its carrying value and is most sensitive to changes in assumptions. As of the date of our most recent goodwill impairment test, May 1, 2011, OSD’s fair value exceeded its carrying value by 21%. The carrying value of OSD’s goodwill was $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2011.
The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results and market conditions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.
Research and Development Costs
Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.
Legal and Other Contingencies
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements.

Item 2, 3
 
Income Taxes
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.

OVERVIEW
The following management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2011 and our financial statements and accompanying Notes to Financial Statements.
Microsoft is a technology leader focused on helping people and businesses throughout the world realize their full potential. We create technology that transforms the way people work, play and communicate across a wide range of computing devices.
We generate revenue by developing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products and services, by designing and selling hardware, and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global customer audience. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees, designing, manufacturing, marketing and selling our products and services, and income taxes.
Industry Trends
Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas which can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad set of research and technology innovations that seek to anticipate the changing demands of customers, industry trends, and competitive forces.
Key Opportunities and Investments
Based on our assessment of key technology trends and our broad focus on long-term research and development of new products and services, we see significant opportunities to drive future growth.
Smart connected devices
The price per unit of processing, storage, and networks continues to decline while at the same time devices increase in capability. This ongoing trend is increasing the capabilities of PCs, mobile, and other devices powered by rich software platforms and applications. At the same time, the information and services people use increasingly span multiple devices. User experiences will be transformed by the adoption of cloud computing when brought together with the richness of smart, connected devices. Microsoft is delivering experiences that seamlessly connect PCs and mobile and other devices through the cloud. We are devoting significant resources to consumer cloud offerings like Bing, Windows Live, and Xbox LIVE. Our software and hardware platform investments can be seen in products like Kinect, Windows, Windows Azure, Windows Phone, Windows Server, and Xbox.

Cloud computing transforming the data center and information technology
Cloud-based solutions provide customers with software, services and content over the Internet by way of shared computing resources located in centralized data centers. Computing is undergoing a long-term shift from client/server to the cloud, a shift similar in importance and impact to the transition from mainframe to client/server. The shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale: larger data centers can deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost than smaller ones; larger data centers can coordinate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns which can improve the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds. As a result of the improved economics, the cloud offers unique levels of elasticity and agility that will enable new solutions and applications. For businesses of all sizes, the cloud creates the opportunity to focus more on innovation while leaving non-differentiating activities to reliable and cost-effective providers. For most businesses, the first step in achieving cloud economics is the adoption of virtualization in their data center. We are devoting significant resources to developing cloud infrastructure, platforms, and applications including offerings such as Microsoft Dynamics Online, Microsoft SQL Azure, Office 365, Windows Azure, Windows Intune, and Windows Server.
Entertainment
The evolution of hardware, software, services, and the cloud are enhancing the delivery and quality of unified entertainment experiences across many devices. These rich media experiences include games, movies, music, television, and social interactions with family, friends, and colleagues. At Microsoft, our approach is to simplify and increase the accessibility of these entertainment experiences to broaden market penetration of our software and services. We invest significant resources in partnerships, content, Windows Phone, Xbox, and Xbox LIVE.
Search
Over the last two decades, web content and social connections have increased dramatically as people spend more time online, while discoverability and accessibility has been transforming from direct navigation and document links. There is significant opportunity to deliver differentiated products that helps users make better decisions and complete tasks more simply when using PC, mobile, and other devices. Our approach is to use machine learning to try to understand user intent, and differentiate our product by focusing on the integration of visual, social, and other elements which simplifies people’s interaction with the Internet. We invest significant resources in Bing, SharePoint, Windows, and Windows Phone.
Communications and productivity
Personal and business productivity has been transformed by the ubiquity of computing and software tools. Over the last decade, Microsoft redefined software productivity beyond the rich Office client on the PC. Productivity scenarios now encompass unified communications, business intelligence, collaboration, content management, and relationship management, which are increasingly powered by server-side applications. These server applications can be hosted by the customer, a partner, or by Microsoft in the cloud. There are significant opportunities to provide productivity and communication scenarios across PCs, mobile devices, and other devices that connect to services. We invest significant resources in Dynamics, Exchange, Lync, Office, Office 365, SharePoint, and Windows Live.
Economic Conditions, Challenges and Risks
As discussed above, our industry is dynamic and highly competitive. We must anticipate changes in technology and business models. Our model for growth is based on our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new markets, both in terms of geographies and product areas, and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market.
At Microsoft, we prioritize our investments among the highest long-term growth opportunities. These investments require significant resources and are multi-year in nature. The products and services we bring to market can be built internally, brought to market as part of a partnership or alliance, or through acquisition.
Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We rely on hiring from a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. Microsoft competes for talented individuals worldwide by offering broad customer reach, scale in resources, and competitive compensation.

Demand for our software, services, and hardware has a strong correlation to global macroeconomic factors. The current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic. See a discussion of these factors and other risks under Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A. of this Form 10-Q).
Seasonality
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Entertainment and Devices Division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, the Entertainment and Devices Division has generated approximately 40% of its yearly segment revenue in our second fiscal quarter.

Revenue increased primarily due to strong sales of the 2010 Microsoft Office system and Server and Tools products. Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2011 included a favorable foreign currency impact of $409 million.
Operating income was up slightly reflecting increased revenue, offset in part by increased operating expenses. Key changes in operating expenses were:
 
  •   
Cost of revenue increased $638 million or 20%, primarily reflecting higher Xbox content royalty costs, higher headcount-related expenses, primarily related to Enterprise Services, and increased costs associated with our online offerings, including traffic acquisition costs.

 
  •   
General and administrative expenses increased $225 million or 24%, due mainly to Puerto Rican excise taxes, increased legal costs, and higher headcount-related expenses.

Headcount-related expenses increased across the company reflecting annual increases in pay and bonuses, changes in our employee compensation program, and a 3% increase in headcount from September 30, 2010. Diluted earnings per share increased reflecting increased net income and the repurchase of 323 million shares during the 12 months ended September 30, 2011.
SEGMENT PRODUCT REVENUE/OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)
The revenue and operating income (loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”) and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. Segment information appearing in Note 16 – Segment Information of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item I of this Form 10-Q) is presented on a basis consistent with our current internal management reporting. Certain corporate-level activity has been excluded from segment operating results and is analyzed separately. We have recast certain prior period amounts within this MD&A to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during the current fiscal year, including moving Forefront Protection for Office, an anti-malware solution, from Server and Tools to the Microsoft Business Division.

Windows & Windows Live Division (“Windows Division”) develops and markets PC operating systems, related software and online services, and PC hardware products. This collection of software, hardware, and services is designed to simplify everyday tasks through efficient browsing capabilities and seamless operations across the user’s hardware and software. Windows Division offerings consist of multiple editions of the Windows operating system, software and services through Windows Live, and Microsoft PC hardware products.
Windows Division revenue is largely correlated to the PC market worldwide, as approximately 75% of total Windows Division revenue comes from Windows operating system software purchased by original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) which they pre-install on equipment they sell. The remaining approximately 25% of Windows Division revenue is generated by commercial and retail sales of Windows and PC hardware products and online advertising from Windows Live.
Windows Division revenue reflected relative performance in PC market segments. We estimate that sales of PCs to businesses grew approximately 5% and sales of PCs to consumers were flat. Excluding a decline in sales of netbooks, we estimate that sales of PCs to consumers grew approximately 8%. Taken together, the total PC market increased an estimated 1% to 3%. Windows Division revenue was positively impacted by higher inventory levels within our distribution channels and higher attach rates, offset in part by the effect of higher growth in emerging markets, where average selling prices are lower, relative to developed markets, and by lower recognition of previously deferred Windows XP revenue.
Windows Division operating income decreased slightly as a result of higher operating expenses, offset in part by increased revenue. Sales and marketing expenses increased $48 million or 8% reflecting increased advertising and marketing of Windows and Windows Live. Research and development expenses increased $37 million or 9% due mainly to product development costs associated with the next version of the Windows operating system and an increase in headcount-related costs. Cost of revenue increased $33 million or 7%, primarily driven by higher traffic acquisition, operation, and support costs.

Server and Tools revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2011 included a favorable foreign currency impact of $108 million.
Server and Tools operating income increased due to revenue growth, offset in part by higher operating expenses. Cost of revenue increased $182 million or 24%, primarily reflecting a $154 million increase in expenses from providing Enterprise Services, which resulted mainly from increased headcount. Sales and marketing expenses increased $116 million or 13% reflecting increased corporate marketing activities.

Online Services Division (“OSD”) develops and markets information and content designed to help people simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, and that help advertisers connect with audiences. OSD offerings include Bing, MSN, adCenter, and advertiser tools. Bing and MSN generate revenue through the sale of search and display advertising. Search and display advertising generally accounts for nearly all of OSD’s annual revenue.
OSD revenue increased primarily as a result of growth in online advertising revenue. Online advertising revenue grew $100 million or 21% to $572 million, reflecting continued growth in search and display advertising revenue, offset in part by decreased third party advertising revenue. Search revenue grew due to our Yahoo! alliance, increased volumes reflecting general market growth, and relative share gains in the U.S., offset in part by decreased revenue per search primarily related to challenges associated with optimizing the adCenter platform for the new mix and volume of traffic from the combined Yahoo! and Bing properties. As of September 30, 2011, according to third-party sources, Bing organic U.S. market share grew over 31% from September 30, 2010 to approximately 15%. Bing-powered U.S. market share, including Yahoo! properties, grew over 13% during this same time period to approximately 27%.
OSD operating loss decreased due to higher revenue and lower sales and marketing expenses, offset in part by increased cost of revenue. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $59 million or 25% due mainly to decreased marketing spend. Cost of revenue grew $85 million driven by increased traffic acquisition costs.

Microsoft Business Division (“MBD”) develops and markets software and online services designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. MBD offerings include the Microsoft Office system (comprising mainly Office, SharePoint, Exchange and Lync), which generates over 90% of MBD revenue, and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions. We evaluate MBD results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business revenue, which includes Microsoft Office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and Microsoft Dynamics revenue; and consumer revenue, which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and OEM revenue.
MBD revenue increased primarily reflecting sales of the 2010 Microsoft Office system. Business revenue increased $326 million or 8%, primarily reflecting growth in multi-year volume licensing revenue, licensing of the 2010 Microsoft Office system to transactional business customers, and a 17% increase in Microsoft Dynamics revenue. Consumer revenue increased $75 million or 7% due mainly to strong sales of the 2010 Microsoft Office system.
MBD revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2011 included a favorable foreign currency impact of $206 million.

EDD offerings include the Xbox 360 entertainment platform (which includes the Xbox 360 gaming and entertainment console, Kinect for Xbox 360, Xbox 360 video games, Xbox LIVE, and Xbox 360 accessories), Mediaroom (our Internet protocol television software), and Windows Phone, including related patent licensing revenue. In November 2010, we released Kinect for Xbox 360.
EDD revenue increased primarily reflecting higher Xbox 360 platform revenue and Windows Phone revenue. Xbox 360 platform revenue grew $114 million or 7%, led by higher Xbox LIVE revenue, offset in part by decreased video game revenue and lower volumes of Xbox 360 consoles sold. Video game revenue decreased due to strong sales of Halo Reach in the prior year. We shipped 2.3 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, compared with 2.8 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first quarter of fiscal year 2011.
EDD revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2011 included a favorable foreign currency impact of $51 million.
EDD operating income decreased reflecting higher operating expenses, offset in part by revenue growth. Cost of revenue grew $173 million or 19% primarily due to higher royalty costs resulting from an increase in Xbox LIVE digital marketplace third-party content sold and sales of Gears of War 3, offset in part by decreased product costs due to fewer sales of Xbox 360 consoles. Research and development expenses increased $24 million or 8%, primarily reflecting higher headcount-related expenses.

We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized in other income (expense). These are generally offset by unrealized gains and losses in the underlying securities in the investment portfolio and are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income.
Dividends and interest income was flat as higher average investment balances were offset by lower yields on our fixed-income investments. Interest expense increased due to our increased issuance of debt. Net recognized gains on investments decreased due primarily to higher other-than-temporary impairments of $45 million in the current period as compared to $9 million in the comparable period. Net gains on derivatives increased due to gains on foreign exchange contracts in the current period as compared to losses in the comparable period. Changes in foreign currency remeasurements were primarily due to currency movements net of our hedging activities.
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rates were approximately 21% and 25% for the three months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate and our prior year’s first quarter effective rate primarily due to a higher mix of earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico, which are subject to lower income tax rates.
Tax contingencies and other tax liabilities were $7.5 billion and $7.4 billion as of September 30, 2011 and June 30, 2011, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. While we settled a portion of the I.R.S. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for these years. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, the I.R.S. completed its examination and issued a Revenue Agent’s Report (“RAR”) for the remaining unresolved items. We do not agree with the adjustments in the RAR, and we have filed a protest to initiate the administrative appeals process. The proposed adjustments are primarily related to transfer pricing and

could have a significant impact on our financial statements if not resolved favorably; however, we believe our existing reserves are adequate. We do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months, as we do not believe the appeals process will be concluded within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to examination by the I.R.S. for tax years 2007 to 2011.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments
Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $57.4 billion as of September 30, 2011, compared with $52.8 billion as of June 30, 2011. Equity and other investments were $8.6 billion as of September 30, 2011 compared to $10.9 billion as of June 30, 2011. Our short-term investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. While we own certain mortgage-backed and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of September 30, 2011 does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. The majority of our mortgage-backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and Government National Mortgage Association.
Of the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at September 30, 2011, approximately $51 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and were subject to material repatriation tax effects. The amount of cash and investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was approximately $440 million. As of September 30, 2011, approximately 67% of the short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in U.S. government and agency securities, approximately 12% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of U.S. companies, and 4% were invested in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, all of which are denominated in U.S. dollars.
Securities lending
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Our securities lending payable balance was $1.1 billion as of September 30, 2011. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the three months ended September 30, 2011 were $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. Intra-quarter variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities.
Valuation
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and U.S. treasuries. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and agency securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.
A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market

in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally labeled as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.
Cash Flows
Cash flows from operations increased $299 million to $8.5 billion due mainly to increased revenue and cash collections, partially offset by cash used to build inventories in anticipation of the holiday season and other changes in working capital. Cash used in financing increased $2.2 billion to $2.9 billion due mainly to a $4.7 billion reduction in proceeds from issuances of long-term debt, partially offset by a $2.5 billion decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases. Cash used in investing decreased $2.6 billion to $2.3 billion due mainly to a $4.2 billion increase in cash from combined investment purchases, sales, and maturities, partially offset by a $793 million decrease in cash from securities lending and an $875 million increase in cash used to invest in multiple intellectual property agreements.
Debt
We issued debt in prior periods to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were used to partially fund discretionary business acquisitions and share repurchases.
As of September 30, 2011, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including convertible debt, were $11.9 billion and $12.9 billion, respectively. This is compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of $11.9 billion and $12.1 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2011. The estimated fair value is based on quoted prices for our publicly-traded debt as of September 30, 2011 and June 30, 2011, as applicable.
The components of long-term debt, the associated interest rates, and the semi-annual interest record and payment dates were as follows as of September 30, 2011:

Notes
The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding.
Convertible Debt
In June 2010, we issued $1.25 billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on June 15, 2013 in a private placement offering. Proceeds from the offering were $1.24 billion, net of fees and expenses, which were capitalized. Each $1,000 principal amount of notes is convertible into 29.94 shares of Microsoft common stock at a conversion price of $33.40 per share. As of September 30, 2011, the net carrying amount of our convertible debt was $1.2 billion and the unamortized discount was $33 million.
Prior to March 15, 2013, the notes will be convertible, only in certain circumstances, into cash and, if applicable, cash, shares of Microsoft’s common stock, or a combination thereof, at our election. On or after March 15, 2013, the notes will be convertible at any time. Upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election.
Because the convertible debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash, we are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods. The net proceeds of $1.24 billion were allocated between debt for $1.18 billion and stockholders’ equity for $58 million with the portion in stockholders’ equity representing the fair value of the option to convert the debt.
In connection with the issuance of the notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates. The capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the notes. Under the capped call transactions, we purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with a cap price equal to $37.16. The purchased capped calls were valued at $40 million and recorded to stockholders’ equity.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue at September 30, 2011 comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. Unearned revenue at September 30, 2011 also included payments for: post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; Xbox LIVE subscriptions and prepaid points; Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products; OEM minimum commitments; unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Windows Phone and of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis for Windows XP; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.
The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of September 30, 2011:

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. In evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued in our financial statements any liabilities related to these indemnifications.
Other Planned Uses of Capital
We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.
Liquidity
We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, as discussed above under Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments, the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, such as business acquisitions and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or other dilution of our earnings. We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates.
As a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $4.1 billion at September 30, 2011. Our retained deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate, pay dividends, or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong financial position.

RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE
Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance
On July 1, 2011, we adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) on disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements. The guidance requires the disclosure of roll-forward activities on purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 fair value measurements). Adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted
In September 2011, the FASB issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. The new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity determines that this is the case, it is required to perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit (if any). If an entity determines the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2012.
In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income. The new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity. Instead, an entity will be required to present either a continuous statement of net income and other comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2012 and will have financial statement presentation changes only.
In May 2011, the FASB issued guidance to amend the accounting and disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The new guidance limits the highest-and-best-use measure to nonfinancial assets, permits certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market or counterparty credit risks to be measured at a net basis, and provides guidance on the applicability of premiums and discounts. Additionally, the new guidance expands the disclosures on Level 3 inputs by requiring quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions, as well as description of the valuation processes and the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2012. Other than requiring additional disclosures, we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and stock-based compensation.
Revenue Recognition
Software revenue recognition requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value exists for those elements. A portion of revenue may be recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, and the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.
Impairment of Investment Securities
Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers
 
39
Table of Contents

PART I
Item 2
 
available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
Goodwill
We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Among our reporting units, the fair value of OSD has been the closest to its carrying value. The carrying value of OSD’s goodwill was $6.4 billion as of September 30, 2011.
The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results and market conditions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.
Research and Development Costs
Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.
Legal and Other Contingencies
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements.
Income Taxes
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been
 
40
Table of Contents

PART I
Item 2, 3
 
recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
NOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain statements in this report, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements may appear throughout this report, including without limitation, the following sections: “Management’s Discussion and Analysis”, and “Risk Factors.” These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section titled “Risk Factors” (refer to Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q). We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
OVERVIEW
Management’s discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2010 and the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes (“Notes”) included in this Form 10-Q.
We generate revenue by developing, manufacturing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products and services for many different types of computing devices. Our software products and services include operating systems for personal computers, servers, and intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; information worker productivity applications; business solutions applications; high-performance computing applications; software development tools; and video games. We provide consulting and product and solution support services, and we train and certify computer system integrators and developers. We also design and sell hardware, including the Xbox 360 console, the Kinect for Xbox 360, and accessories, and Microsoft PC hardware products. Online offerings and information are delivered to consumers through Bing, Windows Live, Xbox LIVE, Microsoft Office Web Apps, our MSN portals and channels, and to businesses through Microsoft Online Services offerings, such as Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online, Exchange Online, and SharePoint Online, and through Windows Azure and SQL Azure. We enable the delivery of online advertising across our broad range of digital media properties and on Bing through our proprietary adCenter platform.
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Entertainment and Devices Division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, the Entertainment and Devices Division has generated approximately 40% of its yearly segment revenues in our second fiscal quarter. In addition, quarterly revenues may be impacted by the deferral of revenue. See the discussions below regarding sales of earlier versions of the Microsoft Office system with a guarantee to be upgraded to the newest version of the Microsoft Office system at minimal or no cost (the “Office Deferral”).
Global macroeconomic factors have a strong correlation to demand for our software, services, hardware, and online offerings. The current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic and uncertain. Irrespective of global economic conditions, we are positive about our relative market position, our current product portfolio, and future product pipeline. Because we offer a wide range of products and services that enable companies to improve productivity and reduce costs, including cloud-based services, we believe that Microsoft is well-positioned to create new opportunities to increase revenue as the global economy improves. We remain focused on executing in the areas we can control by continuing to provide high value products at the lowest total cost of ownership while managing our expenses.

Three months ended March 31, 2011 compared with three months ended March 31, 2010
Revenue increased primarily due to strong sales of the Xbox 360 console, Kinect for Xbox 360, the 2010 Microsoft Office system, and Server and Tools products, offset in part by lower sales of Windows 7. Revenue also increased due to the $305 million Office Deferral during the three months ended March 31, 2010. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant impact on revenue.
Operating income increased reflecting an increase in revenue, offset in part by higher operating expenses. Key changes in operating expenses were:
 
  •   
Cost of revenue increased $1.1 billion or 41%, due to increased volumes of Xbox 360 consoles and Kinect sensors sold and higher costs associated with our online offerings, including traffic acquisition costs and royalty costs relating to Xbox LIVE digital content sold, as well as due to higher expenses from providing Enterprise Services.

 
  •   
Sales and marketing expenses increased $190 million or 6%, primarily reflecting increased advertising and marketing of the Xbox 360 platform, Windows Phone, and Windows and Windows Live, and higher headcount-related expenses.

 
  •   
Research and development expenses increased $49 million or 2%, due mainly to higher headcount-related expenses.

Diluted earnings per share increased reflecting higher revenue, repurchases of common stock, and a partial settlement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“I.R.S.”), which added $0.05 to our diluted earnings per share, offset in part by higher operating expenses.
Nine months ended March 31, 2011 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2010
Revenue increased primarily due to strong sales of the Xbox 360 console, Kinect for Xbox 360, and video games, the 2010 Microsoft Office system, and Server and Tools products, offset in part by lower sales of Windows 7. Revenue also increased due to the $305 million Office Deferral during the nine months ended March 31, 2010 and the recognition of $254 million of revenue associated with the Office Deferral during the nine months ended March 31, 2011. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant impact on revenue.
Operating income increased reflecting the change in revenue, offset in part by higher operating expenses. Key changes in operating expenses were:
 
  •   
Cost of revenue increased $2.6 billion or 29%, due to increased volumes of Xbox 360 consoles and Kinect sensors sold and higher costs associated with our online offerings, including traffic acquisition costs and royalty costs relating to Xbox LIVE digital content sold, as well as due to higher expenses from providing Enterprise Services.

 
  •   
Sales and marketing expenses increased $412 million or 4%, primarily reflecting increased advertising and marketing of the Xbox 360 platform, Windows Phone, and Windows and Windows Live, and higher headcount-related expenses.

 
  •   
Research and development expenses increased $286 million or 4%, due mainly to higher headcount-related expenses and third-party development and programming costs.

Windows & Windows Live Division (“Windows Division”) develops and markets PC operating systems and related software and online services. The Windows Division offerings consist of multiple editions of the Windows operating system, software and services through Windows Live, and Microsoft PC hardware products.
Windows Division revenue growth is largely correlated to the growth of the PC market worldwide as approximately 75% of total Windows Division revenue comes from pre-installed versions of the Windows operating system purchased by original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). The remaining approximately 25% of Windows Division revenue (“other revenue”) is generated by commercial and retail sales of Windows and PC hardware products and online advertising from Windows Live.
Three months ended March 31, 2011 compared with three months ended March 31, 2010
Windows Division revenue was driven primarily by growth in PC market segments. We estimate that sales of PCs to businesses grew approximately 9% this quarter and that sales of PCs to consumers declined approximately 8%. The decline in consumer PC sales included an approximately 40% decline in the sales of Netbooks. Taken together the total PC market declined an estimated 1% to 3%. Considering the impact of the Windows 7 launch in the prior year, we estimate Windows Division revenue and OEM licenses were in line with the PC market. Revenue was also driven by growth in sales of multi-year licensing agreements to businesses and somewhat higher inventory and attach rates offset by higher relative growth in emerging markets.
Windows Division operating income decreased as a result of decreased revenue and higher sales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $127 million or 21% reflecting increased corporate marketing activities and increased advertising of Windows and Windows Live.
Nine months ended March 31, 2011 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2010
Windows Division revenue was driven primarily by growth in PC market segments. We estimate that sales of PCs to businesses grew approximately 12% fiscal year to date and that sales of PCs to consumers declined approximately 1%. The decline in consumer PC sales included an approximately 30% decline in the sales of Netbooks. Taken together the total PC market increased an estimated 3% to 5%. Considering the impact of the Windows 7 launch in the prior year, we estimate Windows Division revenue was in line with the PC market. Revenue was also driven by growth in sales of multi-year licensing agreements to businesses offset by higher relative growth in emerging markets.

Server and Tools develops and markets technology and related services that enable information technology professionals and their systems to be more productive and efficient. Server and Tools product and service offerings include Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Windows Azure, Windows Embedded device platforms and Enterprise Services. Enterprise Services comprise Premier product support services and Microsoft Consulting Services. We also offer developer tools, training and certification. Approximately 50% of Server and Tools revenue comes primarily from multi-year volume licensing agreements, approximately 30% is purchased through transactional volume licensing programs, retail packaged product and licenses sold to OEMs, and the remainder comes from Enterprise Services.
Three months ended March 31, 2011 compared with three months ended March 31, 2010
Server and Tools revenue increased reflecting growth in both product and Enterprise Services. Product revenue increased $308 million or 10%, driven primarily by growth in Windows Server, SQL Server, and Enterprise Client Access License (“CAL”) Suites, reflecting continued adoption of Windows platform applications. Enterprise Services revenue grew $90 million or 12%, due to growth in both Premier product support and consulting services.
Server and Tools operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, offset in part by higher operating expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $137 million or 13% reflecting increased corporate marketing activities and fees paid to third party enterprise software advisors. Cost of revenue increased $115 million or 17% reflecting higher expenses from providing Enterprise Services and online offerings.
Nine months ended March 31, 2011 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2010

Online Services Division (“OSD”) develops and markets information and content that help people simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, and that help advertisers connect with audiences. OSD offerings include Bing, MSN, and advertiser and publisher tools. Bing and MSN generate revenue through the sale of search and display advertising.
Three months ended March 31, 2011 compared with three months ended March 31, 2010
OSD revenue increased primarily as a result of growth in online advertising revenue. Online advertising revenue grew $84 million or 17% to $586 million, reflecting continued growth in search and display revenue, offset in part by decreased third party advertising revenue. Search revenue grew due to increased volumes reflecting general market growth and relative share gains in the U.S., offset in part by decreased revenue per search primarily related to challenges associated with optimizing the adCenter platform for the new mix and volume of traffic from the combined Yahoo! and Bing properties. Bing’s estimated U.S. market share increased approximately 25%.
OSD operating loss increased due to higher operating expenses, offset in part by increased revenue. Cost of revenue grew $292 million driven by costs associated with the Yahoo! search agreement and increased traffic acquisition costs. General and administrative expenses decreased $154 million due mainly to transition expenses in the prior year associated with the inception of the Yahoo! Commercial Agreement. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $39 million or 13% primarily due to lower amortization of intangible assets.

Microsoft Business Division (“MBD”) develops and markets software and services designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. MBD offerings include the Microsoft Office system (comprising mainly Office, SharePoint, Exchange and Lync), which generates over 90% of MBD revenue, and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions. We evaluate MBD results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business revenue, which includes Microsoft Office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and Microsoft Dynamics revenue; and consumer revenue, which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and OEM revenue.
Three months ended March 31, 2011 compared with three months ended March 31, 2010
MBD revenue increased reflecting sales of the 2010 Microsoft Office system, which was released primarily during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, as well as the $305 million Office Deferral during the three months ended March 31, 2010. Consumer revenue increased $525 million or 95%. Excluding the impact associated with the Office Deferral, consumer revenue increased $220 million or 26% due to sales of the 2010 Microsoft Office system. Business revenue increased $386 million or 10%, primarily reflecting licensing of the 2010 Microsoft Office system to transactional business customers, growth in multi-year volume licensing revenue, and a 10% increase in Microsoft Dynamics revenue.

MBD operating income increased due mainly to revenue growth, offset in part by higher operating expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $150 million or 16%, due mainly to increased corporate and cross-platform marketing activities and charges related to intangible assets. Cost of revenue increased $80 million or 24%, primarily driven by higher online costs, costs of providing services, and increased amortization of capitalized software development costs. Research and development costs increased $58 million or 13%, primarily as a result of capitalization of certain Microsoft Office system software development costs in the prior year.
Nine months ended March 31, 2011 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2010
MBD revenue increased primarily reflecting sales of the 2010 Microsoft Office system, the $305 million Office Deferral during the third quarter of fiscal year 2010, and the recognition of $254 million of revenue associated with the Office Deferral during the nine months ended March 31, 2011. Business revenue increased $1.5 billion or 13%, reflecting licensing of the 2010 Microsoft Office system to transactional business customers, growth in multi-year volume licensing revenue, and a 7% increase in Microsoft Dynamics revenue. Consumer revenue increased $1.2 billion or 52%. The growth in consumer revenue includes the $305 million Office Deferral and recognition of $254 million of revenue associated with the Office Deferral. Excluding the impact associated with the Office Deferral, consumer revenue increased $663 million or 25% due to sales of the 2010 Microsoft Office system.
MBD operating income increased due mainly to revenue growth, offset in part by higher operating expenses. Cost of revenue increased $253 million or 28%, primarily driven by higher online costs and costs of providing services.

Entertainment and Devices Division (“EDD”) develops and markets products and services designed to entertain and connect people. EDD offerings include the Xbox 360 platform (which includes the Xbox 360 gaming and entertainment console, Kinect for Xbox 360, Xbox 360 video games, Xbox LIVE, and Xbox 360 accessories), Mediaroom (our Internet protocol television software), and Windows Phone. In November 2010, we released Kinect for Xbox 360 and the latest version of Windows Phone. Windows Phone revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the software.
Three months ended March 31, 2011 compared with three months ended March 31, 2010
EDD revenue increased primarily reflecting higher Xbox 360 platform revenue. Xbox 360 platform revenue grew $712 million or 69%, led by sales of Kinect sensors, increased volumes of Xbox 360 consoles, and higher Xbox LIVE revenues. We shipped 2.7 million Xbox 360 consoles and 2.4 million Kinect sensors (including those sold with consoles) during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, compared with 1.5 million Xbox 360 consoles during the third quarter of fiscal year 2010. On April 21, 2011, we entered into definitive agreements to formalize an alliance with Nokia to enhance our Windows Phone opportunities and strategies for smartphones, productivity tools, mobile marketplace, and services.
EDD operating income increased primarily reflecting revenue growth, offset in part by higher cost of revenue. Cost of revenue increased $640 million or 104% primarily reflecting higher volumes of Xbox 360 consoles and Kinect sensors sold, and increased royalty costs resulting from increased Xbox LIVE digital content sold.
Nine months ended March 31, 2011 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2010
EDD revenue increased primarily reflecting higher Xbox 360 platform revenue. Xbox 360 platform revenue grew $2.4 billion or 52%, led by sales of Kinect sensors, increased volumes of Xbox 360 consoles and video games sold, and higher Xbox LIVE revenue.

Nokia Strategic Alliance
On February 11, 2011, Microsoft and Nokia announced a strategic alliance to jointly create new mobile products and services and to extend established products and services to new markets. On April 21, 2011, the parties entered into definitive agreements to formalize this alliance.
Microsoft will license to Nokia and Nokia will adopt Windows Phone as Nokia’s primary smartphone platform. Microsoft will receive a running royalty at a competitive rate from Nokia for the Windows Phone platform, with minimum commitments reflecting the large volumes Nokia expects to ship. We will also provide Nokia with developer tools to accelerate developer support for Windows and Windows-related platforms. Microsoft and Nokia will collaborate on joint developer outreach and application sourcing. Microsoft’s Windows Marketplace infrastructure will support a new Nokia-branded application store. Participants in the Windows Phone ecosystem will be able to take advantage of Nokia’s billing agreements with operators in markets worldwide.
Nokia will deliver mapping, navigation, and location-based services to the Windows Phone ecosystem and will deliver a core set of mapping services for a broader set of Microsoft’s map-based offerings. Microsoft’s Bing and adCenter will power search and advertising on Nokia’s devices and services. Nokia will innovate and customize on the Windows Phone platform, contributing its expertise on hardware, design, and language support and will help bring Windows Phone to a broader range of price points, market segments and geographies. Microsoft will make annual payments to Nokia, in recognition of the unique nature of Nokia’s agreement with Microsoft and the contributions that Nokia is providing.
The agreements recognize the value of intellectual property portfolios and put in place mechanisms for exchanging rights to intellectual property. As part of these arrangements, Nokia will receive payments including consideration to be paid as part of a mutual release.

Dividends and interest income increased slightly due to higher average portfolio investment balances, offset in part by lower yields on our fixed-income investments. Interest expense increased due to our increased issuance of debt. Net recognized gains on investments increased in the three and nine months ended March 31, 2011 due primarily to higher gains on sales of equity securities. Net losses on derivatives in the three months ended March 31, 2011 were similar to the comparable period as losses on currency contracts used to hedge foreign currency revenues were offset in part by gains on commodity derivatives. Derivative gains increased in the nine months ended March 31, 2011 due primarily to higher gains on commodity derivatives offset in part by losses on currency contracts used to hedge foreign currency revenues. Changes in foreign currency remeasurements for the three months ended March 31, 2011 were primarily due to currency movements net of our hedging activities. Other includes a gain on the divestiture of Razorfish in the nine month period ending March 31, 2010.
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rates were approximately 13% and 25% for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and 21% and 25% for the nine months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our rates decreased and were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the settlement of a portion of an I.R.S. audit of tax years 2004 to 2006, which reduced our income tax expense for the third quarter by $461 million, and a higher mix of earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from continued emphasis on producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operational centers in Ireland, Singapore and Puerto Rico, which are subject to lower income tax rates.
Tax contingencies and other tax liabilities were $7.2 billion and $6.9 billion as of March 31, 2011 and June 30, 2010, respectively, and were included in other long-term liabilities. While we settled a portion of the I.R.S. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006, we remain under audit for these years. Subsequent to quarter end, the I.R.S. issued proposed adjustments for tax years 2004 to 2006 that we have not agreed to and intend to contest through the administrative process. The impact of these proposed adjustments on years currently open to examination could have a significant impact on our financial statements if not resolved favorably. We do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months, as we do not believe the audit will be concluded within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to examination by the I.R.S. for tax years 2007 to 2010.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments
Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $50.2 billion as of March 31, 2011, compared with $36.8 billion as of June 30, 2010. Equity and other investments were $10.7 billion as of March 31, 2011, compared with $7.8 billion as of June 30, 2010. Our short-term investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to

Item 2
 
achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. While we own certain mortgage-backed and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of March 31, 2011 does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. The majority of our mortgage-backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and Government National Mortgage Association.
Of the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at March 31, 2011, approximately $42 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and were subject to material repatriation tax effects. The amount of cash and investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was approximately $267 million. As of March 31, 2011, approximately 70% of the short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in U.S. government and agency securities, approximately 11% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of U.S. companies, and 6% were invested in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, all of which are denominated in U.S. dollars.
Securities Lending
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Our securities lending payable balance was $1.2 billion as of March 31, 2011. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the three months ended March 31, 2011 were $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the nine months ended March 31, 2011 were $1.7 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. Intra-quarter variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities.
Valuation
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and U.S. treasuries. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and agency securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.
A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally labeled as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.
Cash Flows
Cash flows from operations increased $2.6 billion to $21.1 billion for the nine months ended March 31, 2011 due mainly to increased revenue and cash collections. Cash used in financing decreased $3.2 billion to $6.0 billion due mainly to a $5.7 billion increase in proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments, offset in part by a $2.9 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases. Cash used in investing increased $6.5 billion to $13.7 billion due mainly to a $4.4 billion decrease in sales and maturities of investments, along with a $1.7 billion increase in purchases of investments.

Debt
Short-term Debt
During the nine months ended March 31, 2011, we repaid $1.0 billion of commercial paper, leaving zero outstanding.
On November 5, 2010, our $1.0 billion 364-day credit facility expired. This facility served as a back-up for our commercial paper program. No amounts were drawn against the credit facility during any of the periods presented.
Long-term Debt
Notes
We issued debt during the periods presented to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our superior credit rating and the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were used to partially fund discretionary business acquisitions and share repurchases.
As of March 31, 2011, both the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including convertible debt, were $11.9 billion. The estimated fair value is based on quoted prices for our publicly-traded debt as of March 31, 2011, as applicable.
The components of long-term debt, the associated interest rates, and the semi-annual interest record and payment dates were as follows as of March 31, 2011:

As of March 31, 2011, we had issued and outstanding $10.8 billion of debt securities as illustrated in the table above (collectively “the Notes”), including $4.75 billion issued in September 2010 and $2.25 billion issued in February 2011. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding.
Convertible Debt
In June 2010, we issued $1.25 billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on June 15, 2013 in a private placement offering. Proceeds from the offering were $1.24 billion, net of fees and expenses, which were capitalized. Each $1,000 principal amount of notes is convertible into 29.94 shares of Microsoft common stock at a conversion price of $33.40 per share.

PART I
Item 2
 
Prior to March 15, 2013, the notes will be convertible, only in certain circumstances, into cash and, if applicable, cash, shares of Microsoft’s common stock, or a combination thereof, at our election. On or after March 15, 2013, the notes will be convertible at any time. Upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election.
Because the convertible debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash, we are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods. The net proceeds of $1.24 billion were allocated between debt for $1.18 billion and stockholders’ equity for $58 million with the portion in stockholders’ equity representing the fair value of the option to convert the debt.
In connection with the issuance of the notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates. The capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the notes. Under the capped call transactions, we purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with a cap price equal to $37.16. The purchased capped calls were valued at $40 million and recorded to stockholders’ equity.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue at March 31, 2011 comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. Unearned revenue at March 31, 2011 also included payments for: post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; Xbox LIVE subscriptions; Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products; unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Windows Phone and Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis for Windows XP; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.
The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of March 31, 2011:

All repurchases were made using cash resources. As of March 31, 2011, approximately $13.9 billion remained of the $40.0 billion approved repurchase amount. The repurchase program expires September 30, 2013 but may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. In evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued in our financial statements any liabilities related to these indemnifications.
Other Planned Uses of Capital
We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.
Liquidity
We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, as discussed above under Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments, the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, such as acquisitions of businesses and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or other dilution of our earnings. We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to have the ability to borrow funds domestically at reasonable interest rates.
As a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $9.8 billion at March 31, 2011. Our retained deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate, pay dividends, or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong financial position.

RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE
Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance
On July 1, 2010, we adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) on revenue recognition. Under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements, tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product are no longer within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance, and software-enabled products are now subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance. Additionally, the FASB issued guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance. Under the new guidance, when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined, a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. The new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition. Adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
On July 1, 2010, we adopted new guidance issued by the FASB on the consolidation of variable interest entities. The new guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities, ongoing assessments of control over such entities, and additional disclosures for variable interests. Adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted
In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements. The guidance requires the disclosure of roll forward activities on purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 fair value measurements). The guidance will become effective for us with the reporting period beginning July 1, 2011. Other than requiring additional disclosures, the adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, stock-based compensation, and product warranties.
Revenue Recognition
Software revenue recognition requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value exists for those elements. A portion of revenue may be recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.
Impairment of Investment Securities
Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our

Item 2
 
intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
Goodwill
We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Among our reporting units, the fair value of OSD has been the closest to its carrying value. The carrying value of OSD’s goodwill was $6.4 billion as of March 31, 2011.
The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results and market conditions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.
Research and Development Costs
Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.
Legal and Other Contingencies
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements.
Income Taxes
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized

Item 2, 3
 
upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.
Product Warranties
We provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranty, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranty, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
NOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain statements in this report, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements may appear throughout this report, including without limitation, the following sections: “Management’s Discussion and Analysis”, and “Risk Factors.” These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section titled “Risk Factors” (refer to Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q). We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
OVERVIEW
Management’s discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2010 and the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes (“Notes”) included in this Form 10-Q.
We generate revenue by developing, manufacturing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products and services for many different types of computing devices. Our software products and services include operating systems for personal computers, servers, and intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; information worker productivity applications; business solutions applications; high-performance computing applications; software development tools; and video games. We provide consulting and product and solution support services, and we train and certify computer system integrators and developers. We also design and sell hardware, including the Xbox 360 gaming and entertainment console and accessories, and Microsoft PC hardware products. Online offerings and information are delivered to consumers through Bing, Windows Live, Xbox LIVE, Microsoft Office Web Apps, our MSN portals and channels, and to businesses through Microsoft Online Services offerings, such as Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online, Exchange Online, and SharePoint Online, and through Windows Azure and SQL Azure. We enable the delivery of online advertising across our broad range of digital media properties and on Bing through our proprietary adCenter platform.
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Entertainment and Devices Division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, the Entertainment and Devices Division has generated approximately 40% of its yearly segment revenues in our second fiscal quarter. In addition, quarterly revenues may be impacted by the deferral of revenue. See the discussions below regarding the deferral of revenue related to sales of Windows Vista with a guarantee to be upgraded to Windows 7 at minimal or no cost and of Windows 7 to retailers before general availability (the “Windows 7 Deferral”) and sales of earlier versions of the Microsoft Office system with a guarantee to be upgraded to the newest version of the Microsoft Office system at minimal or no cost (the “Office Deferral”).
Global macroeconomic factors have a strong correlation to demand for our software, services, hardware, and online offerings. The current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic and uncertain. Irrespective of global economic conditions, we are positive about our relative market position, our current product portfolio, and future product pipeline. Because we offer a wide range of products and services that enable companies to improve productivity and reduce costs, including cloud-based services, we believe that Microsoft is well-positioned to create new opportunities to increase revenue as the global economy improves. We remain focused on executing in the areas we can control by continuing to provide high value products at the lowest total cost of ownership while managing our expenses.

Revenue increased primarily due to strong sales of the Xbox 360 console and accessories, including Kinect, the 2010 Microsoft Office system, and Server and Tools products. This increase was offset in part by the recognition in the prior year of approximately $1.7 billion of revenue related to the Windows 7 Deferral. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant impact on revenue.
Operating income decreased reflecting higher operating expenses, offset in part by the change in revenue. Key changes in operating expenses were:
 
  •   
Cost of revenue increased $1.2 billion or 33%, primarily reflecting increased volumes of Xbox 360 consoles and accessories sold and higher costs associated with our online offerings.

 
  •   
General and administrative expenses decreased $238 million or 20%, due mainly to a decrease in legal charges and employee severance, offset in part by higher headcount-related expenses.

Windows & Windows Live Division (“Windows Division”) develops and markets PC operating systems and related software and online services. The Windows Division offerings consist of multiple editions of the Windows operating system, software and services through Windows Live, and Microsoft PC hardware products.
Windows Division revenue growth is largely correlated to the growth of the PC market worldwide as approximately 75% of total Windows Division revenue comes from pre-installed versions of the Windows operating system purchased by original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). The remaining approximately 25% of Windows Division revenue (“other revenue”) is generated by commercial and retail sales of Windows and PC hardware products and online advertising from Windows Live.
Three months ended December 31, 2010 compared with three months ended December 31, 2009
Windows Division revenue decreased primarily due to the prior year launch of Windows 7, including recognition of approximately $1.7 billion of revenue in the prior year related to the Windows 7 Deferral. OEM revenue decreased $1.8 billion or 32%. This decrease was driven by the prior year launch of Windows 7, reflecting a decrease in inventory in our distribution channels, and lower Windows attach rates in China, partially offset by PC market growth. Other revenue decreased $314 million or 20%, driven primarily by the prior year launch of Windows 7. Considering the impact of the Windows 7 launch in the prior year, we estimate Windows Division revenue growth was in line with PC market growth. We estimate total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew approximately 2% to 4%.
Windows Division operating income decreased primarily as a result of decreased revenue. In addition, sales and marketing expenses increased $22 million or 3% reflecting increased advertising of Windows and Windows Live.
Six months ended December 31, 2010 compared with six months ended December 31, 2009
Windows Division revenue decreased due to the prior year launch of Windows 7, partially offset by PC market growth. OEM revenue decreased $43 million or 1%. This decrease was driven by the prior year launch of Windows 7, reflecting a decrease in inventory in our distribution channels, and lower Windows attach rates in China, partially offset by PC market growth. Other revenue decreased $181 million or 7%, driven primarily by the prior year launch of Windows 7. Considering the impact of the Windows 7 launch in the prior year, we estimate Windows Division revenue growth was in line with PC market growth. We estimate total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew approximately 6% to 8%.
Windows Division operating income decreased as a result of decreased revenue and higher operating expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $46 million or 3% reflecting increased advertising of Windows and Windows Live. Cost of revenue increased $31 million or 3%, primarily driven by higher traffic acquisition costs, partially offset by decreased product and services costs.

Dividends and interest income increased slightly due to higher average portfolio investment balances, offset in part by lower yields on our fixed-income investments. Interest expense increased due to our increased issuance of debt. Net recognized gains on investments increased in the three months ended December 31, 2010 due primarily to higher gains on sales of equity securities and were relatively consistent in the six months ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the prior period. Net gains on derivatives increased in both the three months and six months ended December 31, 2010 due primarily to higher gains on commodity and interest rate derivatives offset in part by higher losses on currency contracts used to hedge foreign currency revenues. Year-over-year changes in foreign currency remeasurements were primarily due to currency movements net of our hedging activities. Other includes a gain on the divestiture of Razorfish in the prior year periods.
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rates were approximately 22% and 25% for the three months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as compared to 23% and 25% for the six months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The reduction in the tax rate was due to the higher mix of earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions and from the retroactive extension of the research and development tax credit in the United States.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments
Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $41.3 billion as of December 31, 2010, compared with $36.8 billion as of June 30, 2010. Our short-term investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. They consist predominantly of investment grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. Equity and other investments were $10.0 billion as of December 31, 2010, compared with $7.8 billion as of June 30, 2010.

While we own certain mortgage-backed and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of December 31, 2010 does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. The majority of our mortgage-backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and Government National Mortgage Association.
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Our securities lending payable balance was $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2010. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the three months ended December 31, 2010 were $2.1 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the six months ended December 31, 2010 were $1.9 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. Intra-quarter variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities.
Valuation
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and U.S. treasuries. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and agency securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.
A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally labeled as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.
Debt
Short-term Debt
During the three months ended December 31, 2010, we repaid $1.0 billion of commercial paper, leaving zero outstanding.
On November 5, 2010, our $1.0 billion 364-day credit facility expired. This facility served as a back-up for our commercial paper program. No amounts were drawn against the credit facility during any of the periods presented.
Long-term Debt
Notes
As of December 31, 2010, we had issued and outstanding $8.5 billion of debt securities as follows: $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.875% notes due 2013, $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.95% notes due 2014, $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.625% notes due 2015, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of

4.20% notes due 2019, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.0% notes due 2020, $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.20% notes due 2039, and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.5% notes due 2040, (collectively “the Notes”). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding.
Convertible Debt
In June 2010, we issued $1.25 billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on June 15, 2013 in a private placement offering. Proceeds from the offering were $1.24 billion, net of fees and expenses, which were capitalized. Each $1,000 principal amount of notes is convertible into 29.94 shares of Microsoft common stock at a conversion price of $33.40 per share.
Prior to March 15, 2013, the notes will be convertible, only in certain circumstances, into cash and, if applicable, cash, shares of Microsoft’s common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. On or after March 15, 2013, the notes will be convertible at any time. Upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election.
Because the convertible debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash, we are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods. The net proceeds of $1.24 billion were allocated between debt for $1.18 billion and stockholders’ equity for $58 million with the portion in stockholders’ equity representing the fair value of the option to convert the debt.
In connection with the issuance of the notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates. The capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the notes. Under the capped call transactions, we purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with a cap price equal to $37.16. The purchased capped calls were valued at $40 million and recorded to stockholders’ equity.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue at December 31, 2010 comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. Unearned revenue at December 31, 2010 also included payments for: post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; Xbox LIVE subscriptions; Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products; unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Windows Phone and Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis for Windows XP; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.
The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2010:

Cash Flows
Cash flows from operations increased $1.3 billion to $12.4 billion for the six months ended December 31, 2010 due mainly to increased revenue and cash collections. Cash used for financing increased $923 million to $7.4 billion due mainly to a $4.0 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases, offset in part by a $3.0 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt. Cash used in investing increased $5.2 billion to $6.5 billion due mainly to a $6.4 billion decrease in sales and maturities of investments, partially offset by a $1.4 billion decrease in purchases of investments.
Share Repurchases
During the three months and six months ended December 31, 2010, we repurchased approximately 188 million and 351 million shares of Microsoft common stock for $5.0 billion and $9.0 billion, respectively, under the repurchase plan we announced on September 22, 2008. All repurchases were made using cash resources. As of December 31, 2010, approximately $14.7 billion remained of the $40.0 billion approved repurchase amount. The repurchase program expires September 30, 2013 but may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. In evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications in our financial statements.
Other Planned Uses of Capital
We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.
We believe existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations, should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and share repurchases. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs. We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. While we currently do not foresee a need to repatriate funds, should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations locally, we could elect to repatriate funds held in foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates or increased interest expense.

As a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $13.2 billion at December 31, 2010. Our retained deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate, pay dividends, or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.
RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE
Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance
On July 1, 2010, we adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) on revenue recognition. Under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements, tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product are no longer within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance, and software-enabled products are now subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance. Additionally, the FASB issued guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance. Under the new guidance, when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined, a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. The new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition. Adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
On July 1, 2010, we adopted new guidance issued by the FASB on the consolidation of variable interest entities. The new guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities, ongoing assessments of control over such entities, and additional disclosures for variable interests. Adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted
In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements. The guidance requires the disclosure of roll forward activities on purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 fair value measurements). The guidance will become effective for us with the reporting period beginning July 1, 2011. Other than requiring additional disclosures, the adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, stock-based compensation, and product warranties.
Revenue Recognition
Software revenue recognition requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value exists for those elements. A portion of revenue may be recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.

PART I
Item 2
 
Impairment of Investment Securities
Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.
Research and Development Costs
Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.
Legal and Other Contingencies
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements.
Income Taxes
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a
 
40
Table of Contents

PART I
Item 2,3
 
position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.
Product Warranties
We provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranty, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranty, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Note About Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements in this report, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements may appear throughout this report, including without limitation, the following sections: “Business”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis”, and “Risk Factors.” These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section titled “Risk Factors” (refer to Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q). We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
OVERVIEW
Management’s discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2010 and the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes (“Notes”) included in this Form 10-Q.
We generate revenue by developing, manufacturing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products and services for many different types of computing devices. Our software products and services include operating systems for personal computers, servers, and intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; information worker productivity applications; business solutions applications; high-performance computing applications; software development tools; and video games. We provide consulting and product and solution support services, and we train and certify computer system integrators and developers. We also design and sell hardware, including the Xbox 360 gaming and entertainment console and accessories, the Zune digital music and entertainment device and accessories, and Microsoft PC hardware products. Online offerings and information are delivered to consumers through Bing, Windows Live, Microsoft Office Web Apps, our MSN portals and channels, and to businesses through Microsoft Online Services offerings, such as Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online, Exchange Online, Windows Azure, SQL Azure and SharePoint Online. We enable the delivery of online advertising across our broad range of digital media properties and on Bing through our proprietary adCenter platform.
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Entertainment and Devices Division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, the Entertainment and Devices Division has generated approximately 40% of its yearly segment revenues in our second fiscal quarter. In addition, quarterly revenues may be impacted by the deferral of revenue. See the discussions below regarding the deferral of revenue related to sales of Windows Vista with a guarantee to be upgraded to Windows 7 at minimal or no cost and of Windows 7 to retailers before general availability (the “Windows 7 Deferral”).
All growth and percentage comparisons refer to the three months ended September 30, 2010, as compared with the three months ended September 30, 2009, unless otherwise noted.

Revenue increased primarily due to strong sales of Windows 7, the 2010 Microsoft Office system, Server and Tools products, and the Xbox 360 console and video games. Revenue also increased due to the deferral in the prior year of approximately $1.5 billion of revenue related to the Windows 7 Deferral. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant impact on revenue.
Operating income increased reflecting the change in revenue, offset in part by higher operating expenses. Key changes in operating expenses were:
 
  •   
Cost of revenue increased $297 million or 10%, primarily reflecting higher online costs and increased volumes of Xbox 360 consoles sold.

 
  •   
General and administrative expenses increased $197 million or 27%, due mainly to increased legal charges and headcount-related expenses.

 
  •   
Research and development expenses increased $131 million or 6%, due mainly to higher headcount-related expenses and third-party development and programming costs.

Diluted earnings per share increased reflecting increased net income and the repurchase of 485 million shares during the 12 months ended September 30, 2010.
Global macroeconomic factors have a strong correlation to demand for our software, services, hardware, and online offerings. The current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic and uncertain. Irrespective of global economic conditions, we are positive about our relative market position, our current product portfolio, and future product pipeline. Because we offer a wide range of products and services that enable companies to improve productivity and reduce costs, including cloud-based services, we believe that Microsoft is well-positioned to create new opportunities to increase revenue as the global economy improves. We remain focused on executing in the areas we can control by continuing to provide high value products at the lowest total cost of ownership while managing our expenses.
SEGMENT PRODUCT REVENUE/OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)
The revenue and operating income (loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”) and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. Segment information appearing in Note 16 – Segment Information of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item I of this Form 10-Q) is presented on a basis consistent with our current internal management reporting. Certain corporate-level activity has been excluded from segment operating results and is analyzed separately. We have recast certain prior period amounts within this MD&A to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during the current fiscal year.

Windows Division revenue growth is largely correlated to the growth of PC purchases from original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for approximately 75% of total Windows Division revenue. The remaining approximately 25% of Windows Division revenue (“other revenue”) is generated by commercial and retail sales of Windows and online advertising from Windows Live.
Windows Division revenue increased due to strong sales of Windows 7 and PC market growth. We estimate total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew approximately 9% to 11%. OEM revenue increased $1.8 billion or 93%. Including revenue and units associated with the Windows 7 Deferral in the prior year, OEM revenue increased $364 million or 11%, while OEM license units increased 5%. The OEM revenue increase was driven by PC market growth, PC market strength among business customers, and the mix of versions of Windows licensed, partially offset by lower Windows attach rates in China and year-over-year changes in inventory in our distribution channels. Other revenue increased $125 million or 13%, driven primarily by commercial and retail sales of Windows 7.
Windows Division operating income grew as a result of increased revenue, offset in part by higher operating expenses. Cost of revenue increased $22 million or 5%, primarily driven by higher traffic acquisition and royalty costs. Sales and marketing expenses increased $22 million or 4% reflecting advertising and marketing of Windows and Windows Live.

Server and Tools licenses products, applications, tools, content, and delivers Enterprise Services, all of which are designed to make information technology professionals, developers and their systems more productive and efficient. Server and Tools product and service offerings consist of Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Windows Azure and other cloud and server offerings, and Windows Embedded device platforms. We also offer developer tools, training and certification. Enterprise Services comprise Premier product support services and Microsoft Consulting Services. Server product offerings can be run on-site, in a partner-hosted environment, or in a Microsoft-hosted environment. We use multiple sales channels, including pre-installed OEM versions, sales through partners and sales directly to end customers. Approximately 50% of Server and Tools revenue comes from annuity volume licensing agreements, approximately 30% is purchased through transactional volume licensing programs, retail packaged product and licenses sold to OEMs, and the remainder comes from Enterprise Services.
Server and Tools revenue increased reflecting growth in product revenue and Enterprise Services revenue. Product revenue increased $343 million or 12%, driven primarily by growth in Windows Server, SQL Server, Enterprise CAL Suites and Windows Embedded revenue, reflecting continued adoption of Windows platform applications. Enterprise Services revenue grew $66 million or 9%, due to growth in both Premier product support services and consulting services.

Server and Tools operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, offset in part by a slight increase in operating expenses. Cost of revenue increased $55 million or 8%, reflecting higher costs associated with the delivery of services and online costs. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $38 million or 4%, primarily due to lower corporate marketing and advertising expenses.

OSD revenue increased primarily as a result of growth in online advertising revenue. Online advertising revenue grew $55 million or 13% to $473 million, reflecting higher search and owned and operated display advertising revenue, offset in part by decreased third party advertising revenue.
OSD operating loss increased due to higher cost of revenue and research and development expenses, offset in part by increased revenue. Cost of revenue grew $74 million driven by costs associated with the Yahoo! search agreement, partially offset by decreased online traffic acquisition costs. Research and development expenses increased $61 million or 27%, primarily due to headcount-related expenses related to the search portion of the business.

Microsoft Business Division (“MBD”) offerings include the Microsoft Office system and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions. Microsoft Office system products are designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity through a range of programs, services, and software solutions. Microsoft Office system offerings generate over 90% of MBD revenue. Microsoft Dynamics products provide business solutions for financial management, customer relationship management, supply chain management, and analytics applications. We evaluate our results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business revenue, which includes Microsoft Office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and Microsoft Dynamics revenue; and consumer revenue, which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and OEM revenue.
MBD revenue increased primarily reflecting sales of the 2010 Microsoft Office system, which was released during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. Business revenue increased $396 million or 11%, primarily reflecting licensing of the 2010 Microsoft Office system to transactional business customers, growth in multi-year licensing revenue, and a 4% increase in Microsoft Dynamics revenue. Consumer revenue increased $216 million or 26% due to sales of the 2010 Microsoft Office system and growth in the PC market.
MBD operating income increased due mainly to revenue growth, offset in part by higher cost of revenue. Cost of revenue increased $81 million or 30%, primarily driven by higher costs of providing services and increased traffic acquisition costs.

EDD revenue increased primarily reflecting higher Xbox 360 platform revenue. Xbox 360 platform revenue grew $409 million or 33%, primarily reflecting increased volumes of Xbox 360 consoles sold and higher Xbox 360 video game revenue led by Halo Reach. We shipped 2.8 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, compared with 2.1 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. Halo Reach launched in September 2010 generating approximately $350 million of revenue during the quarter.
EDD operating income increased primarily reflecting revenue growth, offset in part by higher operating expenses. Cost of revenue increased $152 million or 19% primarily due to higher volumes of Xbox 360 consoles sold. Research and development expenses increased $65 million or 30%, primarily reflecting higher headcount-related expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $39 million or 27% due mainly to increased Xbox 360 platform marketing activities.

Dividends and interest income increased slightly due to higher average portfolio investment balances, offset in part by lower yields on our fixed-income investments. Interest expense increased due to our increased issuance of debt. Net recognized gains on investments decreased primarily due to fewer gains on sales of investments in the current period as compared to the prior period. Net losses on foreign currency remeasurements increased primarily due to currency movements net of our hedging activities.
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rates were approximately 25% for the three months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments
Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $44.2 billion as of September 30, 2010, compared with $36.8 billion as of June 30, 2010. Our short-term investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. They consist predominantly of investment grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. Equity and other investments were $9.2 billion as of September 30, 2010, compared with $7.8 billion as of June 30, 2010.
While we own certain mortgage-backed and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of September 30, 2010 does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. The majority of our mortgage-backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and Government National Mortgage Association.
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Our securities lending payable balance was $909 million as of September 30, 2010. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the three months ended September 30, 2010 were $1.7 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. Intra-quarter variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities.
Valuation
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments,
 
33
Table of Contents

PART I
Item 2
 
such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and U.S. treasuries. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and agency securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.
A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally labeled as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.
Debt
In September 2010, we issued $4.75 billion of debt securities. See further discussion of these securities under “Notes” below. As of September 30, 2010, we had $10.7 billion of issued and outstanding debt comprising $1.0 billion of commercial paper and $9.7 billion of long-term debt, including $1.3 billion of convertible debt.
Short-term Debt
As of September 30, 2010, our $1.0 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding had a weighted average interest rate, including issuance costs, of 0.19% and maturities of 29 to 42 days. The estimated fair value of this commercial paper approximates its carrying value.
We have a $1.0 billion 364-day credit facility, which expires on November 5, 2010, and which serves as a back-up for our commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2010, we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the credit facility agreement, which requires a coverage ratio be maintained of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense. No amounts were drawn against the credit facility during any of the periods presented.
Long-term Debt
Notes
As of September 30, 2010, we had issued and outstanding $8.5 billion of debt securities as follows: $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.875% notes due 2013, $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.95% notes due 2014, $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.625% notes due 2015, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.20% notes due 2019, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.0% notes due 2020, $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.20% notes due 2039, and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.5% notes due 2040, (collectively “the Notes”). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding.
Convertible Debt
In June 2010, we issued $1.25 billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on June 15, 2013 in a private placement offering. Proceeds from the offering were $1.24 billion, net of fees and expenses, which were capitalized. Each $1,000 principal amount of notes is convertible into 29.94 shares of Microsoft common stock at a conversion price of $33.40 per share.

Table of Contents

PART I
Item 2
 
 
Prior to March 15, 2013, the notes will be convertible, only in certain circumstances, into cash and, if applicable, cash, shares of Microsoft’s common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. On or after March 15, 2013, the notes will be convertible at any time. Upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election.
Because the convertible debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash, we are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods. The net proceeds of $1.24 billion were allocated between debt for $1.18 billion and stockholders’ equity for $58 million with the portion in stockholders’ equity representing the fair value of the option to convert the debt.
In connection with the issuance of the notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates. The capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the notes. Under the capped call transactions, we purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with a cap price equal to $37.16. The purchased capped calls were valued at $40 million and recorded to stockholders’ equity.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue at September 30, 2010 comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. Unearned revenue at September 30, 2010 also included payments for: post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future, Xbox LIVE subscriptions; Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products; unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis for Windows XP; technology guarantee programs, including the 2010 Microsoft Office technology guarantee program; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.
The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of September 30, 2010:

Cash Flows
Cash flows from operations increased $2.1 billion to $8.2 billion due mainly to increased revenue and cash collections, partially offset by a decrease in unearned revenue. Cash used in financing decreased $1.6 billion to $639 million due mainly to $4.7 billion of proceeds from issuances of long-term debt in the current quarter, partially offset by a $2.9 billion increase in common stock repurchases. Cash used in investing increased $3.8 billion to $5.0 billion due mainly to a $2.5 billion increase in cash used for combined investment purchases, sales, and maturities and a $1.1 billion decrease in cash from securities lending.
Share Repurchases
During the three months ended September 30, 2010, we repurchased approximately 163 million shares of Microsoft common stock for $4.0 billion under the repurchase plan we announced on September 22, 2008. All repurchases

were made using cash resources. As of September 30, 2010, approximately $19.7 billion remained of the $40.0 billion approved repurchase amount. The repurchase program expires September 30, 2013 but may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. In evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications in our financial statements.
Other Planned Uses of Capital
We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.
We believe existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations, should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and share repurchases. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs. We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. While we currently do not foresee a need to repatriate funds, should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations locally, we could elect to repatriate funds held in foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates or increased interest expense.
As a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $15.0 billion at September 30, 2010. Our retained deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate, pay dividends, or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.
RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE
Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance
On July 1, 2010, we adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) on revenue recognition. Under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements, tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product are no longer within the scope of
 
36
Table of Contents

PART I
Item 2
 
the software revenue recognition guidance, and software-enabled products are now subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance. Additionally, the FASB issued guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance. Under the new guidance, when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined, a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. The new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition. Adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
On July 1, 2010, we adopted new guidance issued by the FASB on the consolidation of variable interest entities. The new guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities, ongoing assessments of control over such entities, and additional disclosures for variable interests. Adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted
In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements. The guidance requires the disclosure of roll forward activities on purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 fair value measurements). The guidance will become effective for us with the reporting period beginning July 1, 2011. Other than requiring additional disclosures, the adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, stock-based compensation, and product warranties.
Revenue Recognition
Software revenue recognition requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value exists for those elements. A portion of revenue may be recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements. The amount of revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on the VSOE of fair value for those elements using the residual method or relative fair value method, and the deferred revenue is recognized as the elements are delivered. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.
Impairment of Investment Securities
Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.

Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.
Research and Development Costs
Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.
Legal and Other Contingencies
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements.
Income Taxes
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.

Product Warranties
We provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranty, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranty, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Note About Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements in Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”), other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “strategy,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section titled “Risk Factors” (refer to Part II, Item 1A). We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
OVERVIEW
Management’s discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2009 and the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes (“Notes”) included in this Form 10-Q.
We generate revenue by developing, manufacturing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products and services for many different types of computing devices. Our software products and services include operating systems for personal computers, servers, and intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; information worker productivity applications; business solutions applications; high-performance computing applications; software development tools; and video games. We provide consulting and product and solution support services, and we train and certify computer system integrators and developers. We also design and sell hardware, including the Xbox 360 video game console, the Zune digital music and entertainment device, and peripherals. Online offerings and information are delivered to consumers through Bing, Windows Live, Office Live, Xbox LIVE, our MSN portals and channels, and to businesses through Microsoft Online Services offerings, such as Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online, Exchange Online, Windows Azure, and SharePoint Online. We enable the delivery of online advertising across our broad range of digital media properties and on Bing through our proprietary adCenter platform.
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Entertainment and Devices Division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, the Entertainment and Devices Division has generated approximately 40% of its yearly segment revenues in our second fiscal quarter. In addition, quarterly revenues may be impacted by the deferral of revenue. See the discussions below regarding the deferral of revenue related to sales of the 2007 Microsoft Office system with a guarantee to be upgraded to the 2010 Microsoft Office system at minimal or no cost (the “Office 2010 Deferral”) and sales of Windows Vista with a guarantee to be upgraded to Windows 7 at minimal or no cost and of Windows 7 to retailers before general availability (the “Windows 7 Deferral”).
All growth and percentage comparisons refer to the three months and nine months ended March 31, 2010, as compared with the three months and nine months ended March 31, 2009, unless otherwise noted.

Demand for our software, services, hardware, and online offerings has a strong correlation to global macroeconomic factors. While we see the potential for improvement in calendar year 2010, the timing is uncertain. In the meantime, we are positive about our relative market position and our product delivery plans. In addition, we remain focused on executing in the areas we can control by continuing to provide high value products at the lowest total cost of ownership while managing our expenses.
SEGMENT PRODUCT REVENUE/OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)
The revenue and operating income (loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. Segment information appearing in Note 18 – Segment Information of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item I) is presented on a basis consistent with our current internal management reporting. Certain corporate-level activity has been excluded from segment operating results and is analyzed separately. We have recast certain prior period amounts within this section to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during fiscal year 2010, including moving Windows Live

Windows & Windows Live (“Windows”) Division offerings consist of premium and standard edition Windows operating systems and online software and services through Windows Live. Premium Windows operating systems are those that include additional functionality and are sold at a price above our standard editions. Premium editions include Windows 7 Home Premium, Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows Vista Business, Windows Vista Home Premium, Windows Vista Ultimate, and Windows Vista Enterprise. Standard editions include Windows 7 Starter, Windows 7 Home Basic, Windows Vista Home Basic, and Windows XP Home. Windows Live primarily generates revenue from online advertising.
Windows Division revenue growth is directly impacted by growth of PC purchases from original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for approximately 80% of total Windows Division revenue. The remaining approximately 20% of Windows Division revenue (“other revenue”) is generated by commercial and retail sales of Windows and online advertising from Windows Live.
Three months ended March 31, 2010 compared with three months ended March 31, 2009
Windows Division revenue increased due to strong sales of Windows 7 and PC market improvement. We estimate total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew approximately 25% to 27%. OEM revenue increased $781 million or 29%, while OEM license units increased 30%. The OEM revenue increase was primarily driven by PC market growth and higher Windows attach rates across consumer and business segments, partially offset by PC market strength in emerging markets versus developed markets. Other revenue increased $186 million or 26% driven primarily by strong Windows 7 retail sales.
Windows Division operating income increased as a result of increased revenue, offset in part by increased operating expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $105 million or 23% reflecting increased advertising and marketing of Windows 7 and increased sales force expenses related to Windows 7. Cost of revenue increased $91 million or 27%, primarily driven by increased traffic acquisition costs and royalties. These increases were offset in part by a $20 million or 6% reduction in research and development expenses, primarily driven by third-party development and programming costs.
Nine months ended March 31, 2010 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2009
Windows Division revenue increased primarily as a result of strong sales of Windows 7 and PC market improvement. We estimate total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew approximately 13% to 15%. OEM revenue increased $1.5 billion or 16%. Excluding the recognition of $273 million of revenue associated with the Windows 7 Deferral, OEM revenue increased $1.2 billion or 13%, while OEM license units increased 19%. The OEM revenue increase was primarily driven by PC market growth, higher Windows attach rates across consumer and business segments and the restoration of normal OEM inventory levels, offset in part by PC market changes, including stronger growth of emerging markets versus developed markets and of consumer PCs versus business PCs. Other revenue increased $649 million or 27% driven primarily by strong Windows 7 retail sales.

Server and Tools licenses products, applications, tools, content, and Enterprise Services that are designed to make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. Server and Tools product offerings consist of server software licenses and client access licenses (“CAL”) for Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Windows Azure and other server products. We also offer developer tools, training and certification. Enterprise Services comprise Premier product support services and Microsoft Consulting Services. Server product offerings can be run on-site, in a partner-hosted environment, or in a Microsoft-hosted environment. We use multiple sales channels, including pre-installed OEM versions, sales through partners and sales directly to end customers. Approximately 50% of Server and Tools revenue comes from annuity volume licensing agreements, approximately 30% is purchased through transactional volume licensing programs, fully packaged product and licenses sold to OEMs, and the remainder comes from Enterprise Services.
Three months ended March 31, 2010 compared with three months ended March 31, 2009
Server and Tools revenue increased reflecting growth in product revenue and Enterprise Services revenue. Product revenue increased $50 million or 2%, driven primarily by growth in Windows Server and Enterprise CAL Suites revenue, reflecting continued adoption of Windows platform applications, offset in part by a decline in developer tools revenue. Enterprise Services revenue grew $34 million or 5%, primarily due to growth in Premier product support services, offset in part by decreased consulting services.
Server and Tools revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2010 included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of $55 million.
Server and Tools operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, offset in part by increased research and development and sales and marketing expenses. Research and development expenses increased $23 million or 4%, primarily driven by increased hosting and localization costs. Sales and marketing expenses increased $19 million or 2%, primarily due to increased corporate marketing expenses.
Nine months ended March 31, 2010 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2009
Server and Tools revenue increased mainly reflecting growth in product revenue. Product revenue increased $189 million or 2%, driven primarily by growth in Enterprise CAL Suites, System Center and SQL Server revenue, reflecting increased revenue from annuity volume licensing agreements and continued adoption of Windows platform applications, offset in part by a decline in developer tools revenue. Enterprise Services revenue was relatively flat, with growth in Premier product support services nearly offset by decreased consulting services.
Server and Tools operating income increased due to revenue growth and reduced operating expenses. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $60 million or 2%, primarily due to a decrease in headcount-related expenses and corporate marketing expenses. Cost of revenue decreased $47 million or 2%, reflecting a decline in demand for consulting services, offset in part by increased online costs. Research and development expenses decreased $25 million or 2%, primarily driven by reduced third-party development and programming costs and headcount-related expenses, offset in part by increased lab and hosting costs.

Online Services Division (“OSD”) consists of an online advertising platform with offerings for both publishers and advertisers, online information offerings, such as Bing, and the MSN portals and channels around the world. We earn revenue primarily from online advertising, including search, display, and advertiser and publisher tools. Revenue is also generated through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services and from MSN narrowband Internet access subscribers (“Access”).
Yahoo! Commercial Agreement
On December 4, 2009, we entered into a definitive agreement with Yahoo! Inc. (“Yahoo”) whereby Microsoft will provide the exclusive algorithmic and paid search platform for Yahoo websites. We believe this agreement will allow us over time to improve the effectiveness and increase the value of our search offering through greater scale in search queries and an expanded and more competitive search and advertising marketplace. See Note 14 – Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item I) for additional information about the agreement.
Three months ended March 31, 2010 compared with three months ended March 31, 2009

Microsoft Business Division (“MBD”) offerings consist of the Microsoft Office system and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions. Microsoft Office system products are designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity through a range of programs, services, and software solutions. Microsoft Office system offerings generate over 90% of MBD revenue. Microsoft Dynamics products provide business solutions for financial management, customer relationship management, supply chain management, and analytics applications for small and mid-size businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. We evaluate our results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business revenue, which includes Microsoft Office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and Microsoft Dynamics revenue; and consumer revenue, which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and OEM revenue.
Three months ended March 31, 2010 compared with three months ended March 31, 2009
MBD revenue decreased primarily as a result of the deferral of $305 million of revenue for the Office 2010 Deferral. Business revenue decreased $37 million or 1%, primarily reflecting a decline in licensing the 2007 Microsoft Office system to transactional business customers, offset in part by a 3% increase in Microsoft Dynamics revenue. Consumer revenue decreased $228 million or 32%. Including the revenue associated with the Office 2010 Deferral, consumer revenue increased $77 million or 11% due mainly to growth in the PC market.
MBD revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2010 included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of $69 million.
MBD operating income decreased due mainly to decreased revenue, offset in part by decreased operating expenses. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $71 million or 7%, primarily driven by a decrease in corporate marketing activities. Research and development expenses decreased $70 million or 17%, primarily as a result of capitalization of certain Microsoft Office system software development costs. General and administrative expenses decreased $22 million or 28% primarily due to expenses in the prior year associated with the acquisition of FAST Search & Transfer ASA (“FAST”), which we acquired in April 2008. These decreases were offset in part by a $32 million or 12% increase in cost of revenue, primarily driven by increased traffic acquisition costs and increased costs of providing services.
Nine months ended March 31, 2010 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2009
MBD revenue decreased primarily as a result of the deferral of $305 million of revenue for the Office 2010 Deferral. Business revenue decreased $428 million or 4%, primarily reflecting a decline in licensing the 2007 Microsoft Office system to transactional business customers and a 1% decrease in Microsoft Dynamics revenue, offset in part by growth in multi-year volume licensing agreement revenue. The growth in multi-year volume licensing agreement revenue primarily reflects recognition of deferred revenue from previously signed agreements. Consumer revenue decreased $523 million or 20%. Including the revenue associated with the Office 2010 Deferral, consumer revenue decreased $218 million or 8%, primarily as a result of pricing promotions in the first half of fiscal year 2009 that drove increased licensing in that period, a shift to lower-priced products, and a decline in licensing the 2007 Microsoft Office system.
MBD operating income decreased due mainly to decreased revenue, offset in part by decreased operating expenses. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $333 million or 11%, primarily driven by a decrease in corporate marketing activities. Research and development expenses decreased $165 million or 13%, primarily as a result of capitalization of certain Microsoft Office system software development costs and lower headcount-related expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased $50 million or 22% primarily due to expenses in the prior year associated with the acquisition of FAST. These decreases were offset in part by a $63 million or 8% increase in cost of revenue, primarily driven by increased traffic acquisition costs and increased costs of providing services.

Entertainment and Devices Division (“EDD”) offerings include the Xbox 360 platform (which includes the Microsoft Xbox 360 video game console system, Xbox 360 video games, Xbox LIVE, and Xbox 360 accessories), the Zune digital music and entertainment platform (including Zune HD, which was released in September 2009), PC software games, online games and services, Mediaroom (our Internet protocol television software), the Microsoft Surface computing platform, Windows Mobile and embedded device platforms, and other devices. EDD leads the development efforts for our line of consumer software and hardware products including application software for Apple’s Macintosh computers and Microsoft PC hardware products, and is responsible for all retail sales and marketing for Microsoft Office and Windows operating systems.
Three months ended March 31, 2010 compared with three months ended March 31, 2009
EDD revenue increased primarily reflecting an increase in Xbox LIVE revenue and non-gaming revenue, offset in part by decreased revenue from Xbox 360 video games and decreased Xbox 360 consoles sold. Non-gaming revenue increased $77 million or 14%, primarily reflecting increased sales of Windows embedded device platforms and PC hardware products. The decreased revenue from Xbox 360 video games was due primarily to the launch of Halo Wars in the third quarter of the prior year. We shipped 1.5 million Xbox 360 consoles during the third quarter of fiscal year 2010, compared with 1.7 million Xbox 360 consoles during the third quarter of fiscal year 2009.
EDD revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2010 included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of $62 million.
EDD operating income increased due mainly to a $199 million or 22% decrease in cost of revenue resulting primarily from lower Xbox 360 console costs, offset in part by increased online costs resulting from increased Xbox LIVE activity. Research and development expenses increased $31 million or 7%, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses, partially offset by decreased third-party development and programming costs.
Nine months ended March 31, 2010 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2009
EDD revenue decreased reflecting decreases in Xbox 360 platform and PC game revenue, as well as decreased revenue from the non-gaming portion of the business. Xbox 360 platform and PC game revenue decreased $240 million or 5% due mainly to decreased Xbox 360 consoles sold, decreased revenue per console, and decreased revenue from Xbox 360 video games, offset in part by increased Xbox LIVE revenue. We shipped 8.8 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first nine months of fiscal year 2010, compared with 10 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first nine months of fiscal year 2009. The decreased revenue per console resulted from price reductions during the past 12 months. The decreased revenue from Xbox 360 video games was due primarily to the release of three significant games in the prior year compared to two significant games in the current year. Non-gaming revenue decreased $80 million or 4%, primarily reflecting decreased sales of Window Mobile device platforms and Zune digital music and entertainment devices.
EDD operating income increased due to reduced operating expenses, offset in part by decreased revenue. Cost of revenue decreased $779 million or 19%, primarily due to lower Xbox 360 console costs, offset in part by increased online costs resulting from increased Xbox LIVE activity. Research and development expenses decreased $82 million or 6%, primarily reflecting decreased third-party development and programming costs. Sales and marketing expenses decreased by $60 million or 6%, primarily due to decreased marketing for the Xbox 360 platform.

Certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments, including costs of: broad-based sales and marketing; product support services; human resources; legal; finance; information technology; corporate development and procurement activities; research and development; legal settlements and contingencies; and employee severance. Corporate-level expenses decreased due mainly to employee severance charges of $290 million incurred in the third quarter of the prior year and cost controls, and for the nine months ended March 31, 2010, due also to decreased partner payments. These decreases in expenses were offset in part by an increase in legal charges and costs associated with broad-based sales and marketing activities. Legal charges were approximately $187 million and $436 million during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2010, respectively. This is compared to legal charges of $57 million and $90 million for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009, respectively.

the three months ended March 31, 2009 and decreased primarily due to improvements in market conditions. Net losses on derivatives increased primarily due to lower gains on interest rate derivatives and higher losses on commodity derivatives as compared to the prior period. Net losses from foreign currency remeasurements increased due to a strengthening U.S. dollar.
Nine months ended March 31, 2010 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2009
Dividends and interest decreased primarily due to increased interest expense on our long-term debt and lower interest rates on our fixed-income investments, offset in part by higher average investment portfolio balances. Net recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to lower other-than-temporary impairments, offset in part by lower gains on sales of investments in the current period due to sales of certain equity investments held in our strategic investments portfolio in the prior period. Other-than-temporary impairments were $36 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2010, as compared with $754 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2009 and decreased primarily due to improvements in market conditions. Net gains on derivatives increased due to gains on commodity, equity and interest rate derivatives as compared to losses in the prior period in addition to lower losses on foreign exchange contracts in the current period. Net losses from foreign currency remeasurements decreased due to a weakening U.S. dollar. For the nine months ended March 31, 2010, other includes a gain on the divestiture of Razorfish.
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate was 25% for both the three months and nine months ended March 31, 2010, as compared with 27% for both the three months and nine months ended March 31, 2009. The fiscal year 2010 rate reflects a higher mix of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments
Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $39.7 billion as of March 31, 2010, compared with $31.4 billion as of June 30, 2009. Equity and other investments were $7.8 billion as of March 31, 2010, compared with $4.9 billion as of June 30, 2009. Our short-term investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. They consist predominantly of investment grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk.
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine fair value. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, U.S. treasuries, and agency securities. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and certain agency securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.
A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally labeled as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. Such controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.
While we own certain mortgage- and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of March 31, 2010 does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. The majority of the mortgage-backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and

carry a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and Government National Mortgage Association.
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.
Debt
In September 2008, our Board of Directors authorized debt financings of up to $6.0 billion. Our initial commercial paper program provided for the issuance and sale of up to $2.0 billion. Following the issuance of our long-term debt in May 2009, we increased the commercial paper program and issued an additional $250 million of commercial paper during the nine months ended March 31, 2010. As of March 31, 2010, we had $2.25 billion of commercial paper and $3.75 billion of long-term debt issued and outstanding.
Short-term Debt
As of March 31, 2010, our $2.25 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding had a weighted average interest rate, including issuance costs, of 0.17% and maturities of 35 to 216 days. In November 2009, we replaced our $2.0 billion and $1.0 billion credit facilities with a $2.25 billion 364-day credit facility, which expires on November 5, 2010. This facility serves as a back-up for our commercial paper program. As of March 31, 2010, we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the credit facility, which requires a coverage ratio maintained of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense. No amounts were drawn against the credit facilities during the nine months ended March 31, 2010.
Long-term Debt
As of March 31, 2010, we had issued and outstanding $3.75 billion of debt securities as follows: $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.95% notes due 2014, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.20% notes due 2019, and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.20% notes due 2039 (collectively “the Notes”). Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year to holders of record on the preceding May 15 and November 15. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding.
We are using the net proceeds from sales of the debt securities for general corporate purposes, which may include funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of our capital stock, and acquisitions.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue at March 31, 2010 comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. Unearned revenue at March 31, 2010 also included payments for: unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis for Windows XP; post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; Xbox LIVE subscriptions; Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products; unspecified enhancements for Zune HD; the 2010 Microsoft Office system technology guarantee program; online advertising for which the advertisement has yet to be displayed; Mediaroom; and other offerings for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.

Retained Deficit
As a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and common stock repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $16.8 billion at March 31, 2010. Our retained deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate, pay dividends, or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.
Cash Flows
Cash flow from operations increased $3.3 billion to $18.5 billion for the nine months ended March 31, 2010. This increase was due mainly to payment of approximately $3.1 billion to the Internal Revenue Service in the prior year as a result of our settlement of the 2000-2003 audit examination.
Cash used for financing was $9.2 billion for the nine months ended March 31, 2010, a decrease of $969 million from the corresponding period of the prior year. This decrease reflects a $1.9 billion decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases and a $1.0 billion increase in cash from issuance of common stock, offset in part by a $1.7 billion decrease in net proceeds from debt and short-term borrowings.
Cash used in investing was $7.2 billion for the nine months ended March 31, 2010, a decrease of $718 million from the corresponding period of the prior year. This decrease reflects lower additions to property and equipment.
Share Repurchases
During the three months and nine months ended March 31, 2010, we repurchased approximately 67 million and 250 million shares of Microsoft common stock for $2.0 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively, under the repurchase plan we announced on September 22, 2008. All repurchases were made using cash resources. As of March 31, 2010, approximately $27.5 billion remained of the $40.0 billion approved repurchase amount. The repurchase program expires September 30, 2013 but may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.

Other Planned Uses of Capital
We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.
We believe existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations, should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and share repurchases. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. In evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications in our financial statements.
RECENT LEGISLATION
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law in the United States. This legislation expands health care coverage to many uninsured individuals and expands coverage to those already insured. The changes required by this legislation will largely be funded through tax increases to both insurers and the insured. We do not expect any short term impact on our financial results as a result of the legislation. One provision that will impact certain companies significantly is the elimination of the tax deductibility of the Medicare Part D subsidy. This provision does not affect us as we do not provide retiree health benefits.
RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE
Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance
In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The guidance requires new disclosures on the transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 (quoted prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities) and Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) of the fair value measurement hierarchy, including the reasons and the timing of the transfers. Additionally, the guidance requires a roll forward of activities on purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 fair value measurements). The guidance became effective for us with the reporting period beginning January 1, 2010, except for the disclosure on the roll forward activities for Level 3 fair value measurements, which will become effective for us with the reporting period beginning July 1, 2011. Other than requiring additional disclosures, adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
On July 1, 2009, we adopted guidance issued by the FASB on business combinations. The guidance retains the fundamental requirements that the acquisition method of accounting (previously referred to as the purchase method of accounting) be used for all business combinations, but requires a number of changes, including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized and measured as a result of business combinations. It also requires the capitalization of in-process research and development at fair value and requires the expensing of acquisition-related costs as incurred. We have applied this guidance to business combinations completed since July 1, 2009.
On July 1, 2009, we adopted guidance issued by the FASB that changes the accounting and reporting for non-controlling interests. Non-controlling interests are to be reported as a component of equity separate from the parent’s

Item 2
 
equity, and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control are to be accounted for as equity transactions. In addition, net income attributable to a non-controlling interest is to be included in net income and, upon a loss of control, the interest sold, as well as any interest retained, is to be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in net income. Adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
On July 1, 2009, we adopted guidance on fair value measurement for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). Adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted
In October 2009, the FASB issued guidance on revenue recognition that will become effective for us beginning July 1, 2010, with earlier adoption permitted. Under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements, tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will no longer be within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance, and software-enabled products will now be subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance. Additionally, the FASB issued guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance. Under the new guidance, when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined, a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. The new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition. We believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities, which is effective for us beginning July 1, 2010. The new guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities, ongoing assessments of control over such entities, and additional disclosures for variable interests. We believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for contingencies, accounting for income taxes, accounting for stock-based compensation, and accounting for product warranties.
Revenue Recognition
Software revenue recognition requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value exists for those elements.
A portion of the revenue related to Windows XP is recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements including, in some cases, free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. The amount of revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on the VSOE of fair value for those elements using the residual method or relative fair value method. Unearned revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related products’ life cycles. Revenue related to Windows Vista and Windows 7 is not subject to a similar deferral because there are no significant undelivered elements. 2007 Microsoft Office system revenue is subject to deferral as a result of the 2010 Microsoft Office system technology guarantee program, which started March 5, 2010. This program allows customers who purchased certain versions of the 2007 Microsoft Office system to receive an upgrade to the corresponding version of the 2010 Microsoft Office system at minimal or no cost when the product becomes generally available. Accordingly, estimated revenue related to the undelivered 2010 Microsoft Office system is deferred until the product is delivered.
Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of

Item 2
 
earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.
Impairment of Investment Securities
Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.
In connection with the disposal of Razorfish, we performed an interim impairment analysis of our Online Services Division goodwill balance during the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. No impairment of goodwill was identified.
Research and Development Costs
Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.
Legal and Other Contingencies
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements.

Income Taxes
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.
Product Warranties
We provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranty, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranty, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Note About Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements in Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”), other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “strategy,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section titled “Risk Factors” (refer to Part II, Item 1A). We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
OVERVIEW
Management’s discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2009 and the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes (“Notes”) included in this Form 10-Q.
We generate revenue by developing, manufacturing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products and services for many different types of computing devices. Our software products and services include operating systems for personal computers, servers, and intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; information worker productivity applications; business solutions applications; high-performance computing applications; software development tools; and video games. We provide consulting and product and solution support services, and we train and certify computer system integrators and developers. We also design and sell hardware, including the Xbox 360 video game console, the Zune digital music and entertainment device, and peripherals. Online offerings and information are delivered through Bing, Windows Live, Office Live, Xbox LIVE, our MSN portals and channels, and the Microsoft Online Services platform, which includes offerings for businesses, such as Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online, Exchange Hosted Services, Exchange Online, and SharePoint Online. We enable the delivery of online advertising across our broad range of digital media properties and on Bing through our proprietary adCenter platform.
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Entertainment and Devices Division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, the Entertainment and Devices Division has generated approximately 40% of its yearly segment revenues in our second fiscal quarter. In addition, quarterly revenues may be impacted by the deferral of revenue. See the discussion below regarding the deferral of revenue related to Windows 7, which negatively impacted revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 and positively impacted revenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010.
All growth and percentage comparisons refer to the three months and six months ended December 31, 2009, as compared with the three months and six months ended December 31, 2008, unless otherwise noted.

Three months ended December 31, 2009 compared with three months ended December 31, 2008
Revenue increased mainly due to the launch of Windows 7 on October 22, 2009. Operating income increased reflecting increased revenue and decreased operating expenses in most categories.
 
  •   
Cost of revenue decreased $279 million or 7%, primarily reflecting decreased Xbox 360 console costs and cost controls, offset in part by increased online costs, mainly traffic acquisition costs.

 
  •   
Research and development expenses decreased $211 million or 9%, primarily reflecting a decrease in third-party development and programming costs, a decrease in headcount, and the capitalization of certain software development costs.

 
  •   
General and administrative expenses increased $293 million or 35%, primarily due to increased legal charges.

Diluted earnings per share increased primarily reflecting increased net income and share repurchases during the past 12 months. We repurchased 183 million shares during the 12 months ended December 31, 2009.
Six months ended December 31, 2009 compared with six months ended December 31, 2008
Revenue increased mainly due to the launch of Windows 7 on October 22, 2009. Operating income increased reflecting increased revenue and decreased operating expenses in most categories.
 
  •   
Research and development expenses decreased $429 million or 9%, primarily reflecting a decrease in third-party development and programming costs, a decrease in headcount, and the capitalization of certain software development costs.

 
  •   
Sales and marketing expenses decreased $297 million or 4%, due mainly to cost controls and decreased corporate marketing and advertising spending.

 
  •   
Cost of revenue decreased $285 million or 4%, primarily reflecting decreased Xbox 360 console costs and cost controls, offset in part by increased online costs, mainly traffic acquisition costs.

 
  •   
General and administrative expenses increased $147 million or 9%, primarily due to increased legal charges, offset in part by cost controls.

Diluted earnings per share increased primarily reflecting increased net income and share repurchases during the past 12 months.
Demand for our software, services, hardware, and online offerings has a strong correlation to global macroeconomic factors. While we see the potential for improvement in calendar year 2010, the timing is uncertain. In the meantime, we are positive about our relative market position and our product delivery plans. In addition, we remain focused on executing in the areas we can control by continuing to provide high value products at the lowest total cost of ownership while managing our expenses.
SEGMENT PRODUCT REVENUE/OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)
The revenue and operating income (loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. Segment information appearing in Note 18 – Segment Information of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item I) is presented on a basis consistent with our current internal management reporting. Certain corporate-level activity has been excluded from segment operating results and is analyzed separately. We have recast certain prior period amounts within this section to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during fiscal year 2010, including moving Windows Live from Online Services Division to Windows & Windows Live Division, Mobile Services from Online Services Division to Entertainment and Devices Division, and Razorfish from Online Services Division to Corporate. Razorfish was disposed of in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010.

Windows & Windows Live (“Windows”) Division offerings consist of premium and standard edition Windows operating systems and online software and services through Windows Live. Premium Windows operating systems are those that include additional functionality and are sold at a price above our standard editions. Premium editions include Windows 7 Home Premium, Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows Vista Business, Windows Vista Home Premium, Windows Vista Ultimate, and Windows Vista Enterprise. Standard editions include Windows 7 Starter, Windows 7 Home Basic, Windows Vista Home Basic, and Windows XP Home. Windows Live primarily generates revenue from online advertising.
Windows Division revenue growth is directly impacted by growth of PC purchases from original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for approximately 80% of total Windows Division revenue. The remaining approximately 20% of Windows Division revenue (“other revenue”) is generated by commercial and retail sales of Windows and online advertising from Windows Live. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, we deferred revenue (the “Windows 7 Deferral”) associated with sales of Windows Vista with a guarantee to be upgraded to Windows 7 at minimal or no cost and with sales of Windows 7 to retailers before general availability. We recognized the majority of this deferred revenue in the second quarter after launching Windows 7 on October 22, 2009.
Three months ended December 31, 2009 compared with three months ended December 31, 2008
Windows Division revenue increased due to strong sales of Windows 7 and PC market improvement. We estimate total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew approximately 15% to 17%. OEM revenue increased $2.3 billion or 72%. Excluding $1.7 billion of revenue recognized related to the Windows 7 Deferral, OEM revenue increased $664 million or 21%, while OEM license units increased 22%. The OEM revenue increase was primarily driven by PC market growth, higher Windows attach rates across all regions, channels, and types of PCs and the restoration of normal OEM inventory levels, offset in part by PC market changes, including stronger growth of consumer PCs versus business PCs and of emerging markets versus developed markets. Other revenue increased $511 million or 60% driven primarily by strong Windows 7 retail sales.
Windows Division operating income increased as a result of increased revenue, offset in part by increased operating expenses. Cost of revenue increased $81 million or 25%, primarily driven by increased retail product costs, traffic acquisition costs and royalties. Sales and marketing expenses increased $113 million or 18% reflecting increased advertising and marketing campaigns for the launch of Windows 7.
Six months ended December 31, 2009 compared with six months ended December 31, 2008
Windows Division revenue increased primarily as a result of strong sales of Windows 7 and PC market improvement. We estimate total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew approximately 8% to 10%. OEM revenue increased $708 million or 11%. Excluding the recognition of $248 million of revenue associated with the Windows 7 Deferral, OEM revenue increased $460 million or 7%, while OEM license units increased 14%. The OEM revenue increase was primarily driven by PC market growth, higher Windows attach rates across all regions, channels, and types of PCs and the restoration of normal OEM inventory levels, offset in part by PC market changes, including stronger growth of consumer PCs versus business PCs and of emerging markets versus developed markets. Other revenue increased $483 million or 29% driven primarily by strong Windows 7 retail sales.

Server and Tools licenses products, applications, tools, content, and services that are designed to make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. Server and Tools product offerings consist of server software licenses and client access licenses (“CAL”) for Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, and other server products. We also offer developer tools, training and certification. Our services offerings include Premier product support services and Microsoft Consulting Services. Server products can be run on-site, in a partner-hosted environment, or in a Microsoft-hosted environment. We use multiple channels for licensing, including pre-installed OEM versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. Approximately 50% of Server and Tools revenue comes from annuity volume licensing agreements, approximately 30% is purchased through transactional volume licensing programs, fully packaged product and licenses sold to OEMs, and the remainder comes from services.
Three months ended December 31, 2009 compared with three months ended December 31, 2008
Server and Tools revenue increased reflecting growth in product revenue, offset in part by a decline in services revenue. Product revenue increased $103 million or 3%, primarily driven by growth in Windows Server, Enterprise CAL Suites and System Center revenue. The growth in product revenue reflects continued adoption of Windows platform applications. Services revenue declined $14 million or 2%, primarily due to decreased revenue from consulting services.
Server and Tools operating income increased primarily due to product revenue growth and a decrease in research and development expenses. Research and development expenses decreased $41 million or 7%, primarily driven by decreased headcount-related expenses and third-party development and programming costs.
Six months ended December 31, 2009 compared with six months ended December 31, 2008
Server and Tools revenue increased reflecting growth in product revenue, offset in part by a decline in services revenue. Product revenue increased $138 million or 2%, primarily driven by growth in Enterprise CAL Suites, System Center and SQL Server revenue. The growth in product revenue reflects increased revenue from annuity volume licensing agreements and continued adoption of Windows platform applications. Services revenue declined $32 million or 2%, primarily due to decreased revenue from consulting services.
Server and Tools operating income increased primarily due to product revenue growth and decreases in all operating expense categories. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $87 million or 4%, primarily due to a decrease in headcount-related expenses and corporate marketing expenses. Research and development expenses decreased $70 million or 6%, primarily driven by reduced third-party development and programming costs and headcount-related expenses. Cost of revenue decreased $66 million or 5%, reflecting the decline in demand for consulting services. General and administrative expenses decreased $27 million or 14%, due to decreased headcount-related expenses.

Online Services Division (“OSD”) consists of an online advertising platform with offerings for both publishers and advertisers, online information offerings, such as Bing, and the MSN portals and channels around the world. We earn revenue primarily from online advertising, including search, display, and advertiser and publisher tools. Revenue is also generated through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services and from MSN narrowband Internet access subscribers (“Access”).
Three months ended December 31, 2009 compared with three months ended December 31, 2008
OSD revenue decreased as a result of lower Access and online advertising revenue. Access revenue decreased $14 million or 29%, reflecting continued migration of subscribers to broadband or other competitively-priced service providers. Online advertising revenue decreased $11 million or 2%, to $516 million, reflecting a decrease in display advertising and advertiser and publisher tools revenue, offset in part by an increase in search revenue. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $13 million or two percentage point increase in revenue.
OSD operating loss increased mainly due to increased cost of revenue and decreased revenue, offset in part by decreased research and development expenses. Cost of revenue increased $171 million or 50%, primarily driven by higher online traffic acquisition costs. Research and development expenses decreased $49 million or 17%, primarily due to decreased third-party development and programming costs and headcount-related expenses.
Six months ended December 31, 2009 compared with six months ended December 31, 2008

Online advertising revenue decreased $32 million or 3%, to $934 million, primarily reflecting a decrease in display advertising and advertiser and publisher tools revenue. Access revenue decreased $28 million or 29%, reflecting continued migration of subscribers to broadband or other competitively-priced service providers.
OSD operating loss increased mainly due to increased cost of revenue and decreased revenue, offset in part by decreased research and development expenses. Cost of revenue increased $347 million or 54%, primarily driven by higher online traffic acquisition costs. Research and development expenses decreased $88 million or 16%, primarily due to decreased third-party development and programming costs.
Yahoo! Commercial Agreement
On December 4, 2009, we entered into a definitive 10-year agreement with Yahoo! Inc. (“Yahoo”) whereby Microsoft will provide the exclusive algorithmic and paid search platform for Yahoo websites. We believe this agreement will allow us over time to improve the effectiveness and increase the value of our search offering through greater scale in search queries and an expanded and more competitive search and advertising marketplace. The transaction is subject to regulatory review; we expect to close the transaction in fiscal year 2010.

Microsoft Business Division (“MBD”) offerings consist of the Microsoft Office system and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions. Microsoft Office system products are designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity through a range of programs, services, and software solutions. Microsoft Office system offerings generate over 90% of MBD revenue. Microsoft Dynamics products provide business solutions for financial management, customer relationship management, supply chain management, and analytics applications for small and mid-size businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. We evaluate our results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business revenue, which includes Microsoft Office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and Microsoft Dynamics revenue; and consumer revenue, which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and OEM revenue.
Three months ended December 31, 2009 compared with three months ended December 31, 2008
MBD revenue decreased reflecting decreased business revenue partially offset by increased consumer revenue. Business revenue decreased $231 million or 6%, primarily reflecting a decline in licensing the 2007 Microsoft Office system to transactional business customers, offset in part by a 1% increase in Microsoft Dynamics revenue. Consumer revenue increased $95 million or 12%, primarily as a result of growth in the PC market.
MBD operating income was flat reflecting decreased revenue, offset by decreased sales and marketing and research and development expenses. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $81 million or 7%, primarily driven by a decrease in corporate marketing activities and headcount-related costs associated with our corporate sales force. Research and development expenses decreased $64 million or 15%, primarily as a result of capitalization of certain Microsoft Office system software development costs.
Six months ended December 31, 2009 compared with six months ended December 31, 2008
MBD revenue decreased reflecting decreased business and consumer revenue. Business revenue decreased $392 million or 5%, primarily reflecting a decline in licensing the 2007 Microsoft Office system to transactional business customers and a 2% decrease in Microsoft Dynamics revenue, offset in part by growth in multi-year volume licensing agreement revenue. The growth in multi-year volume licensing agreement revenue primarily reflects recognition of deferred revenue from previously signed agreements. Consumer revenue decreased $295 million or 15%, primarily as a result of pricing promotions in the first half of fiscal year 2009 that drove increased licensing in that period, a shift to lower-priced products, and a decline in licensing the 2007 Microsoft Office system.
MBD operating income decreased due mainly to decreased revenue, offset in part by decreased sales and marketing and research and development expenses. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $262 million or 12%, primarily driven by a decrease in corporate marketing activities and headcount-related costs associated with our corporate sales force. Research and development expenses decreased $95 million or 11%, primarily as a result of capitalization of certain Microsoft Office system software development costs and lower headcount-related expenses.

Three months ended December 31, 2009 compared with three months ended December 31, 2008
EDD revenue decreased reflecting a $295 million or 12% decline in Xbox 360 platform and PC game revenue. This decrease was due mainly to decreased revenue from Xbox 360 video games, decreased Xbox 360 consoles sold, and decreased revenue per console, offset in part by increased Xbox LIVE revenue. The decreased revenue from Xbox 360 video games was due primarily to the release of two significant games in the second quarter of the prior year. We shipped 5.2 million Xbox 360 consoles during the second quarter of fiscal year 2010, compared with 6.0 million Xbox 360 consoles during the second quarter of fiscal year 2009. The decreased revenue per console resulted from price reductions during the past 12 months. Non-gaming revenue decreased $59 million or 8%, primarily reflecting decreased sales of Zune digital music and entertainment devices and Windows Mobile device platforms. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $49 million or two percentage point increase in revenue.
EDD operating income increased due to reduced operating expenses. Cost of revenue decreased $478 million or 23%, primarily due to lower Xbox 360 console costs, offset in part by increased royalties to partners related to increased Xbox LIVE transactions. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $75 million or 15%, primarily due to decreased marketing for the Xbox 360 platform. Research and development expenses decreased $50 million or 10%, primarily reflecting decreased headcount-related expenses and third-party development and programming costs.
Six months ended December 31, 2009 compared with six months ended December 31, 2008
EDD revenue decreased reflecting decreases in Xbox 360 platform and PC game revenue, as well as decreased revenue from the non-gaming portion of the business. Xbox 360 platform and PC game revenue decreased by $199 million or 5% due mainly to decreased Xbox 360 consoles sold, decreased revenue per console, and decreased revenue from Xbox 360 games, offset in part by increased Xbox LIVE revenue. We shipped 7.3 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first half of fiscal year 2010, compared with 8.3 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first half of fiscal year 2009. The decreased revenue per console resulted from price reductions during the past 12 months. The decreased revenue from Xbox 360 video games was due primarily to the release of two significant games in the second quarter of the prior year. Non-gaming revenue decreased $157 million or 11%, primarily reflecting decreased sales of Zune digital music and entertainment devices and Window Mobile device platforms.
EDD operating income increased due to reduced operating expenses. Cost of revenue decreased $581 million or 19%, primarily due to lower Xbox 360 console costs, offset in part by increased royalties to partners related to increased Xbox LIVE transactions. Sales and marketing expenses decreased by $59 million or 8%, primarily due to decreased marketing for the Xbox 360 platform. Research and development expenses decreased $113 million or 12%, primarily reflecting decreased headcount-related expenses and third-party development and programming costs.

Three months ended December 31, 2009 compared with three months ended December 31, 2008
Dividends and interest decreased primarily due to increased interest expense on our long-term debt and lower interest rates on our fixed-income investments, offset in part by higher average investment portfolio balances. Net recognized gains on investments decreased primarily due to sales of certain equity investments held in our strategic investments portfolio in the prior period, offset in part by lower other-than-temporary impairments. Other-than-temporary impairments were $6 million during the three months ended December 31, 2009, as compared with $262 million during the three months ended December 31, 2008 and decreased primarily due to improvements in market conditions. Net gains on derivatives increased across all asset classes in the current period as compared with losses in the prior period. Net losses from foreign currency remeasurements declined due to a weakening U.S. dollar. Other includes a gain on the divestiture of Razorfish.

Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate was 25% for both the three months and six months ended December 31, 2009, as compared with 26% for the three months and 27% for the six months ended December 31, 2008. The fiscal year 2010 rate reflects a higher mix of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments
Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $36.1 billion as of December 31, 2009, compared with $31.4 billion as of June 30, 2009. Equity and other investments were $7.0 billion as of December 31, 2009, compared with $4.9 billion as of June 30, 2009. Our investments consist primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also includes foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. We invest primarily in short-term securities to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation.
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine fair value. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, U.S. treasuries, and agency securities. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and certain agency securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.
A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally labeled as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. Such controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.
While we own certain mortgage- and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of December 31, 2009 does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. The majority of the mortgage-backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and Government National Mortgage Association.
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.
Debt
In September 2008, our Board of Directors authorized debt financings of up to $6.0 billion. Our initial commercial paper program provided for the issuance and sale of up to $2.0 billion. Following the issuance of our long-term debt in May 2009, we increased the commercial paper program and issued an additional $250 million of commercial paper during the six months ended December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, we had $2.25 billion of commercial paper and $3.75 billion of long-term debt issued and outstanding.

Short-term Debt
As of December 31, 2009, our $2.25 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding had a weighted average interest rate, including issuance costs, of 0.14% and maturities of 16 to 210 days. In November 2009, we replaced our $2.0 billion and $1.0 billion credit facilities with a $2.25 billion 364-day credit facility, which expires on November 5, 2010. This facility serves as a back-up for our commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the credit facility, which requires a coverage ratio maintained of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense. No amounts were drawn against the credit facilities during the six months ended December 31, 2009.
Long-term Debt
As of December 31, 2009, we had issued and outstanding $3.75 billion of debt securities as follows: $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.95% notes due 2014, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.20% notes due 2019, and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.20% notes due 2039 (collectively “the Notes”). Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year to holders of record on the preceding May 15 and November 15. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding.
We are using the net proceeds from sales of the debt securities for general corporate purposes, which may include funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of our capital stock, and acquisitions.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue at December 31, 2009 comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. Unearned revenue at December 31, 2009 also included payments for: unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis for Windows XP; post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; Xbox LIVE subscriptions; Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products; unspecified enhancements for Zune HD; the Windows 7 Upgrade Option program; online advertising for which the advertisement has yet to be displayed; Mediaroom; and other offerings for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.
The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2009:

Retained Deficit
As a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and common stock repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $18.3 billion at December 31, 2009. Our retained deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate, pay dividends, or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.

Cash Flows
Cash flow from operations increased $1.9 billion to $11.1 billion for the six months ended December 31, 2009. This increase was due mainly to payment of approximately $3.1 billion to the Internal Revenue Service in the prior year as a result of our settlement of the 2000-2003 audit examination, offset in part by a decrease in cash received from customers in the current year.
Cash used for financing was $6.5 billion for the six months ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $2.6 billion from the corresponding period of the prior year. This decrease was due mainly to a $3.9 billion decrease in common stock repurchases, offset in part by a $1.7 billion decrease in net proceeds from debt and short-term borrowings.
Cash used in investing was $1.3 billion for the six months ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $613 million from the corresponding period of the prior year. This decrease reflects lower additions to property and equipment.
Share Repurchases
During the three months and six months ended December 31, 2009, we repurchased 125 million and 183 million shares of Microsoft common stock for $3.6 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, under the repurchase plan we announced on September 22, 2008. As of December 31, 2009, approximately $29.5 billion remained of the $40.0 billion approved repurchase amount. All repurchases were made using cash resources. The repurchase program expires September 30, 2013 but may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.

Other Planned Uses of Capital
We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.
We believe existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations, should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and share repurchases. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. In evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications in our financial statements.
RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE
Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance
On July 1, 2009, we adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) on business combinations. The guidance retains the fundamental requirements that the acquisition method of accounting (previously referred to as the purchase method of accounting) be used for all business combinations, but requires a number of changes, including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized and measured as a result of business combinations. It also requires the capitalization of in-process research and development at fair value and requires the expensing of acquisition-related costs as incurred. We have applied this guidance to business combinations completed since July 1, 2009.
On July 1, 2009, we adopted the guidance issued by the FASB that changes the accounting and reporting for non-controlling interests. Non-controlling interests are to be reported as a component of equity separate from the parent’s equity, and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control are to be accounted for as equity transactions. In addition, net income attributable to a non-controlling interest is to be included in net income and, upon a loss of control, the interest sold, as well as any interest retained, is to be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in net income. Adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
On July 1, 2009, we adopted the guidance on fair value measurement for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). Adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted
In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The guidance requires new disclosures on the transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 (quoted prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities) and Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) of the fair value measurement hierarchy, including the reasons and the timing of the transfers. Additionally, the guidance requires a roll forward of activities on purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 fair value measurements). The guidance will become effective for us with the reporting period beginning January 1, 2010, except for the disclosure on the roll forward activities for Level 3 fair value measurements, which will become effective for us with the reporting period beginning July 1, 2011. Other than requiring additional disclosures, adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
In October 2009, the FASB issued guidance on revenue recognition that will become effective for us beginning July 1, 2010, with earlier adoption permitted. Under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements, tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will no longer be within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance, and software-enabled products will now be subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance. Additionally, the FASB issued guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance. Under the new guidance, when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined, a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. The new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition. We believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities, which is effective for us beginning July 1, 2010. The new guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities, ongoing assessments of control over such entities, and additional disclosures for variable interests. We believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for contingencies, accounting for income taxes, accounting for stock-based compensation, and accounting for product warranties.

Item 2
 
Revenue Recognition
Software revenue recognition requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value exists for those elements.
A portion of the revenue related to Windows XP is recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements including, in some cases, free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. The amount of revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on the VSOE of fair value for those elements using the residual method or relative fair value method. Unearned revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related products’ life cycles. Revenue related to Windows Vista is not subject to a similar deferral because there are no significant undelivered elements. However, Windows Vista revenue is subject to deferral as a result of the Windows 7 Upgrade Option program which started June 26, 2009. The program allowed customers who purchased certain versions of Windows Vista to receive an upgrade to the corresponding version of Windows 7 at minimal or no cost. In addition, purchasers of retail packaged Windows Vista from participating retailers in participating markets may have qualified for a free or discounted upgrade to the equivalent Windows 7 product when the product became generally available in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010. Accordingly, previously deferred revenue related to the undelivered Windows 7 product sold was recognized in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 once the product had been delivered.
Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.
Impairment of Investment Securities
Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.

In connection with the disposal of Razorfish, we performed an interim impairment analysis of our Online Services Division goodwill balance during the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. No impairment of goodwill was identified.
Research and Development Costs
Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.
Legal and Other Contingencies
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements.
Income Taxes
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.
Product Warranties
We provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranty, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranty, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Note About Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements in Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”), other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “strategy,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section titled “Risk Factors” (refer to Part II, Item 1A). We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
OVERVIEW
Management’s discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2009 and the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes (“Notes”) included in this Form 10-Q.
We generate revenue by developing, manufacturing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products and services for many different types of computing devices. Our software products and services include operating systems for personal computers, servers, and intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; information worker productivity applications; business solutions applications; high-performance computing applications; software development tools; and video games. We provide consulting and product and solution support services, and we train and certify computer system integrators and developers. We also design and sell hardware, including the Xbox 360 video game console, the Zune digital music and entertainment device, and peripherals. Online offerings and information are delivered through Bing, Windows Live, Office Live, Xbox LIVE, our MSN portals and channels, and the Microsoft Online Services platform, which includes offerings for businesses, such as Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online, Exchange Hosted Services, Exchange Online, and SharePoint Online. We enable the delivery of online advertising across our broad range of digital media properties and on Bing through our proprietary adCenter platform.
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Entertainment and Devices Division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, the Entertainment and Devices Division has generated approximately 40% of its yearly segment revenues in our second fiscal quarter. In addition, quarterly revenues may be impacted by the deferral of revenue. See the discussion below regarding the deferral of revenue related to Windows 7, which negatively impacted revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 and positively impacted revenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010.
All growth and percentage comparisons refer to the three months and six months ended December 31, 2009, as compared with the three months and six months ended December 31, 2008, unless otherwise noted.

  •   
Cost of revenue decreased $279 million or 7%, primarily reflecting decreased Xbox 360 console costs and cost controls, offset in part by increased online costs, mainly traffic acquisition costs.

 
  •   
Research and development expenses decreased $211 million or 9%, primarily reflecting a decrease in third-party development and programming costs, a decrease in headcount, and the capitalization of certain software development costs.

 
  •   
General and administrative expenses increased $293 million or 35%, primarily due to increased legal charges.

Diluted earnings per share increased primarily reflecting increased net income and share repurchases during the past 12 months. We repurchased 183 million shares during the 12 months ended December 31, 2009.
Six months ended December 31, 2009 compared with six months ended December 31, 2008
Revenue increased mainly due to the launch of Windows 7 on October 22, 2009. Operating income increased reflecting increased revenue and decreased operating expenses in most categories.
 
  •   
Research and development expenses decreased $429 million or 9%, primarily reflecting a decrease in third-party development and programming costs, a decrease in headcount, and the capitalization of certain software development costs.

 
  •   
Sales and marketing expenses decreased $297 million or 4%, due mainly to cost controls and decreased corporate marketing and advertising spending.

 
  •   
Cost of revenue decreased $285 million or 4%, primarily reflecting decreased Xbox 360 console costs and cost controls, offset in part by increased online costs, mainly traffic acquisition costs.

 
  •   
General and administrative expenses increased $147 million or 9%, primarily due to increased legal charges, offset in part by cost controls.

Diluted earnings per share increased primarily reflecting increased net income and share repurchases during the past 12 months.
Demand for our software, services, hardware, and online offerings has a strong correlation to global macroeconomic factors. While we see the potential for improvement in calendar year 2010, the timing is uncertain. In the meantime, we are positive about our relative market position and our product delivery plans. In addition, we remain focused on executing in the areas we can control by continuing to provide high value products at the lowest total cost of ownership while managing our expenses.
SEGMENT PRODUCT REVENUE/OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)
The revenue and operating income (loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. Segment information appearing in Note 18 – Segment Information of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item I) is presented on a basis consistent with our current internal management reporting. Certain corporate-level activity has been excluded from segment operating results and is analyzed separately. We have recast certain prior period amounts within this section to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during fiscal year 2010, including moving Windows Live from Online Services Division to Windows & Windows Live Division, Mobile Services from Online Services Division to Entertainment and Devices Division, and Razorfish from Online Services Division to Corporate. Razorfish was disposed of in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010.

Windows & Windows Live (“Windows”) Division offerings consist of premium and standard edition Windows operating systems and online software and services through Windows Live. Premium Windows operating systems are those that include additional functionality and are sold at a price above our standard editions. Premium editions include Windows 7 Home Premium, Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows Vista Business, Windows Vista Home Premium, Windows Vista Ultimate, and Windows Vista Enterprise. Standard editions include Windows 7 Starter, Windows 7 Home Basic, Windows Vista Home Basic, and Windows XP Home. Windows Live primarily generates revenue from online advertising.
Windows Division revenue growth is directly impacted by growth of PC purchases from original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for approximately 80% of total Windows Division revenue. The remaining approximately 20% of Windows Division revenue (“other revenue”) is generated by commercial and retail sales of Windows and online advertising from Windows Live. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, we deferred revenue (the “Windows 7 Deferral”) associated with sales of Windows Vista with a guarantee to be upgraded to Windows 7 at minimal or no cost and with sales of Windows 7 to retailers before general availability. We recognized the majority of this deferred revenue in the second quarter after launching Windows 7 on October 22, 2009.
Three months ended December 31, 2009 compared with three months ended December 31, 2008
Windows Division revenue increased due to strong sales of Windows 7 and PC market improvement. We estimate total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew approximately 15% to 17%. OEM revenue increased $2.3 billion or 72%. Excluding $1.7 billion of revenue recognized related to the Windows 7 Deferral, OEM revenue increased $664 million or 21%, while OEM license units increased 22%. The OEM revenue increase was primarily driven by PC market growth, higher Windows attach rates across all regions, channels, and types of PCs and the restoration of normal OEM inventory levels, offset in part by PC market changes, including stronger growth of consumer PCs versus business PCs and of emerging markets versus developed markets. Other revenue increased $511 million or 60% driven primarily by strong Windows 7 retail sales.
Windows Division operating income increased as a result of increased revenue, offset in part by increased operating expenses. Cost of revenue increased $81 million or 25%, primarily driven by increased retail product costs, traffic acquisition costs and royalties. Sales and marketing expenses increased $113 million or 18% reflecting increased advertising and marketing campaigns for the launch of Windows 7.
Six months ended December 31, 2009 compared with six months ended December 31, 2008
Windows Division revenue increased primarily as a result of strong sales of Windows 7 and PC market improvement. We estimate total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew approximately 8% to 10%. OEM revenue increased $708 million or 11%. Excluding the recognition of $248 million of revenue associated with the Windows 7 Deferral, OEM revenue increased $460 million or 7%, while OEM license units increased 14%. The OEM revenue increase was primarily driven by PC market growth, higher Windows attach rates across all regions, channels, and types of PCs and the restoration of normal OEM inventory levels, offset in part by PC market changes, including stronger growth of consumer PCs versus business PCs and of emerging markets versus developed markets. Other revenue increased $483 million or 29% driven primarily by strong Windows 7 retail sales.

Server and Tools licenses products, applications, tools, content, and services that are designed to make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. Server and Tools product offerings consist of server software licenses and client access licenses (“CAL”) for Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, and other server products. We also offer developer tools, training and certification. Our services offerings include Premier product support services and Microsoft Consulting Services. Server products can be run on-site, in a partner-hosted environment, or in a Microsoft-hosted environment. We use multiple channels for licensing, including pre-installed OEM versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. Approximately 50% of Server and Tools revenue comes from annuity volume licensing agreements, approximately 30% is purchased through transactional volume licensing programs, fully packaged product and licenses sold to OEMs, and the remainder comes from services.
Three months ended December 31, 2009 compared with three months ended December 31, 2008
Server and Tools revenue increased reflecting growth in product revenue, offset in part by a decline in services revenue. Product revenue increased $103 million or 3%, primarily driven by growth in Windows Server, Enterprise CAL Suites and System Center revenue. The growth in product revenue reflects continued adoption of Windows platform applications. Services revenue declined $14 million or 2%, primarily due to decreased revenue from consulting services.
Server and Tools operating income increased primarily due to product revenue growth and a decrease in research and development expenses. Research and development expenses decreased $41 million or 7%, primarily driven by decreased headcount-related expenses and third-party development and programming costs.
Six months ended December 31, 2009 compared with six months ended December 31, 2008
Server and Tools revenue increased reflecting growth in product revenue, offset in part by a decline in services revenue. Product revenue increased $138 million or 2%, primarily driven by growth in Enterprise CAL Suites, System Center and SQL Server revenue. The growth in product revenue reflects increased revenue from annuity volume licensing agreements and continued adoption of Windows platform applications. Services revenue declined $32 million or 2%, primarily due to decreased revenue from consulting services.
Server and Tools operating income increased primarily due to product revenue growth and decreases in all operating expense categories. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $87 million or 4%, primarily due to a decrease in headcount-related expenses and corporate marketing expenses. Research and development expenses decreased $70 million or 6%, primarily driven by reduced third-party development and programming costs and headcount-related expenses. Cost of revenue decreased $66 million or 5%, reflecting the decline in demand for consulting services. General and administrative expenses decreased $27 million or 14%, due to decreased headcount-related expenses.

Online Services Division (“OSD”) consists of an online advertising platform with offerings for both publishers and advertisers, online information offerings, such as Bing, and the MSN portals and channels around the world. We earn revenue primarily from online advertising, including search, display, and advertiser and publisher tools. Revenue is also generated through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services and from MSN narrowband Internet access subscribers (“Access”).
Three months ended December 31, 2009 compared with three months ended December 31, 2008
OSD revenue decreased as a result of lower Access and online advertising revenue. Access revenue decreased $14 million or 29%, reflecting continued migration of subscribers to broadband or other competitively-priced service providers. Online advertising revenue decreased $11 million or 2%, to $516 million, reflecting a decrease in display advertising and advertiser and publisher tools revenue, offset in part by an increase in search revenue. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $13 million or two percentage point increase in revenue.
OSD operating loss increased mainly due to increased cost of revenue and decreased revenue, offset in part by decreased research and development expenses. Cost of revenue increased $171 million or 50%, primarily driven by higher online traffic acquisition costs. Research and development expenses decreased $49 million or 17%, primarily due to decreased third-party development and programming costs and headcount-related expenses.
Six months ended December 31, 2009 compared with six months ended December 31, 2008
OSD revenue decreased primarily as a result of lower online advertising and Access revenue. Online advertising revenue decreased $32 million or 3%, to $934 million, primarily reflecting a decrease in display advertising and advertiser and publisher tools revenue. Access revenue decreased $28 million or 29%, reflecting continued migration of subscribers to broadband or other competitively-priced service providers.
OSD operating loss increased mainly due to increased cost of revenue and decreased revenue, offset in part by decreased research and development expenses. Cost of revenue increased $347 million or 54%, primarily driven by higher online traffic acquisition costs. Research and development expenses decreased $88 million or 16%, primarily due to decreased third-party development and programming costs.
Yahoo! Commercial Agreement
On December 4, 2009, we entered into a definitive 10-year agreement with Yahoo! Inc. (“Yahoo”) whereby Microsoft will provide the exclusive algorithmic and paid search platform for Yahoo websites. We believe this agreement will allow us over time to improve the effectiveness and increase the value of our search offering through greater scale in search queries and an expanded and more competitive search and advertising marketplace. The transaction is subject to regulatory review; we expect to close the transaction in fiscal year 2010.

Microsoft Business Division (“MBD”) offerings consist of the Microsoft Office system and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions. Microsoft Office system products are designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity through a range of programs, services, and software solutions. Microsoft Office system offerings generate over 90% of MBD revenue. Microsoft Dynamics products provide business solutions for financial management, customer relationship management, supply chain management, and analytics applications for small and mid-size businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. We evaluate our results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business revenue, which includes Microsoft Office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and Microsoft Dynamics revenue; and consumer revenue, which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and OEM revenue.
Three months ended December 31, 2009 compared with three months ended December 31, 2008
MBD revenue decreased reflecting decreased business revenue partially offset by increased consumer revenue. Business revenue decreased $231 million or 6%, primarily reflecting a decline in licensing the 2007 Microsoft Office system to transactional business customers, offset in part by a 1% increase in Microsoft Dynamics revenue. Consumer revenue increased $95 million or 12%, primarily as a result of growth in the PC market.
MBD operating income was flat reflecting decreased revenue, offset by decreased sales and marketing and research and development expenses. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $81 million or 7%, primarily driven by a decrease in corporate marketing activities and headcount-related costs associated with our corporate sales force. Research and development expenses decreased $64 million or 15%, primarily as a result of capitalization of certain Microsoft Office system software development costs.
Six months ended December 31, 2009 compared with six months ended December 31, 2008
MBD revenue decreased reflecting decreased business and consumer revenue. Business revenue decreased $392 million or 5%, primarily reflecting a decline in licensing the 2007 Microsoft Office system to transactional business customers and a 2% decrease in Microsoft Dynamics revenue, offset in part by growth in multi-year volume licensing agreement revenue. The growth in multi-year volume licensing agreement revenue primarily reflects recognition of deferred revenue from previously signed agreements. Consumer revenue decreased $295 million or 15%, primarily as a result of pricing promotions in the first half of fiscal year 2009 that drove increased licensing in that period, a shift to lower-priced products, and a decline in licensing the 2007 Microsoft Office system.
MBD operating income decreased due mainly to decreased revenue, offset in part by decreased sales and marketing and research and development expenses. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $262 million or 12%, primarily driven by a decrease in corporate marketing activities and headcount-related costs associated with our corporate sales force. Research and development expenses decreased $95 million or 11%, primarily as a result of capitalization of certain Microsoft Office system software development costs and lower headcount-related expenses.

Three months ended December 31, 2009 compared with three months ended December 31, 2008
EDD revenue decreased reflecting a $295 million or 12% decline in Xbox 360 platform and PC game revenue. This decrease was due mainly to decreased revenue from Xbox 360 video games, decreased Xbox 360 consoles sold, and decreased revenue per console, offset in part by increased Xbox LIVE revenue. The decreased revenue from Xbox 360 video games was due primarily to the release of two significant games in the second quarter of the prior year. We shipped 5.2 million Xbox 360 consoles during the second quarter of fiscal year 2010, compared with 6.0 million Xbox 360 consoles during the second quarter of fiscal year 2009. The decreased revenue per console resulted from price reductions during the past 12 months. Non-gaming revenue decreased $59 million or 8%, primarily reflecting decreased sales of Zune digital music and entertainment devices and Windows Mobile device platforms. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $49 million or two percentage point increase in revenue.
EDD operating income increased due to reduced operating expenses. Cost of revenue decreased $478 million or 23%, primarily due to lower Xbox 360 console costs, offset in part by increased royalties to partners related to increased Xbox LIVE transactions. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $75 million or 15%, primarily due to decreased marketing for the Xbox 360 platform. Research and development expenses decreased $50 million or 10%, primarily reflecting decreased headcount-related expenses and third-party development and programming costs.
Six months ended December 31, 2009 compared with six months ended December 31, 2008
EDD revenue decreased reflecting decreases in Xbox 360 platform and PC game revenue, as well as decreased revenue from the non-gaming portion of the business. Xbox 360 platform and PC game revenue decreased by $199 million or 5% due mainly to decreased Xbox 360 consoles sold, decreased revenue per console, and decreased revenue from Xbox 360 games, offset in part by increased Xbox LIVE revenue. We shipped 7.3 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first half of fiscal year 2010, compared with 8.3 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first half of fiscal year 2009. The decreased revenue per console resulted from price reductions during the past 12 months. The decreased revenue from Xbox 360 video games was due primarily to the release of two significant games in the second quarter of the prior year. Non-gaming revenue decreased $157 million or 11%, primarily reflecting decreased sales of Zune digital music and entertainment devices and Window Mobile device platforms.
EDD operating income increased due to reduced operating expenses. Cost of revenue decreased $581 million or 19%, primarily due to lower Xbox 360 console costs, offset in part by increased royalties to partners related to increased Xbox LIVE transactions. Sales and marketing expenses decreased by $59 million or 8%, primarily due to decreased marketing for the Xbox 360 platform. Research and development expenses decreased $113 million or 12%, primarily reflecting decreased headcount-related expenses and third-party development and programming costs.

Those results include expenses such as broad-based sales and marketing, product support services, human resources, legal, finance, information technology, corporate development and procurement activities, research and development and other costs, and legal settlements and contingencies. Corporate-level expenses increased, primarily reflecting an increase in legal charges, offset in part by cost controls and for the six months ended December 31, 2009, by decreased partner payments. Legal charges were approximately $290 million during the three months ended December 31, 2009.

Three months ended December 31, 2009 compared with three months ended December 31, 2008
Dividends and interest decreased primarily due to increased interest expense on our long-term debt and lower interest rates on our fixed-income investments, offset in part by higher average investment portfolio balances. Net recognized gains on investments decreased primarily due to sales of certain equity investments held in our strategic investments portfolio in the prior period, offset in part by lower other-than-temporary impairments. Other-than-temporary impairments were $6 million during the three months ended December 31, 2009, as compared with $262 million during the three months ended December 31, 2008 and decreased primarily due to improvements in market conditions. Net gains on derivatives increased across all asset classes in the current period as compared with losses in the prior period. Net losses from foreign currency remeasurements declined due to a weakening U.S. dollar. Other includes a gain on the divestiture of Razorfish.

Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate was 25% for both the three months and six months ended December 31, 2009, as compared with 26% for the three months and 27% for the six months ended December 31, 2008. The fiscal year 2010 rate reflects a higher mix of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments
Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $36.1 billion as of December 31, 2009, compared with $31.4 billion as of June 30, 2009. Equity and other investments were $7.0 billion as of December 31, 2009, compared with $4.9 billion as of June 30, 2009. Our investments consist primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also includes foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. We invest primarily in short-term securities to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation.
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine fair value. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, U.S. treasuries, and agency securities. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and certain agency securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.
A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally labeled as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. Such controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.
While we own certain mortgage- and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of December 31, 2009 does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. The majority of the mortgage-backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and Government National Mortgage Association.
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.
Debt
In September 2008, our Board of Directors authorized debt financings of up to $6.0 billion. Our initial commercial paper program provided for the issuance and sale of up to $2.0 billion. Following the issuance of our long-term debt in May 2009, we increased the commercial paper program and issued an additional $250 million of commercial paper during the six months ended December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, we had $2.25 billion of commercial paper and $3.75 billion of long-term debt issued and outstanding.

Short-term Debt
As of December 31, 2009, our $2.25 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding had a weighted average interest rate, including issuance costs, of 0.14% and maturities of 16 to 210 days. In November 2009, we replaced our $2.0 billion and $1.0 billion credit facilities with a $2.25 billion 364-day credit facility, which expires on November 5, 2010. This facility serves as a back-up for our commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the credit facility, which requires a coverage ratio maintained of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense. No amounts were drawn against the credit facilities during the six months ended December 31, 2009.
Long-term Debt
As of December 31, 2009, we had issued and outstanding $3.75 billion of debt securities as follows: $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.95% notes due 2014, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.20% notes due 2019, and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.20% notes due 2039 (collectively “the Notes”). Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year to holders of record on the preceding May 15 and November 15. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding.
We are using the net proceeds from sales of the debt securities for general corporate purposes, which may include funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of our capital stock, and acquisitions.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue at December 31, 2009 comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. Unearned revenue at December 31, 2009 also included payments for: unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis for Windows XP; post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; Xbox LIVE subscriptions; Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products; unspecified enhancements for Zune HD; the Windows 7 Upgrade Option program; online advertising for which the advertisement has yet to be displayed; Mediaroom; and other offerings for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.
The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2009:

Retained Deficit
As a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and common stock repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $18.3 billion at December 31, 2009. Our retained deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate, pay dividends, or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.

Cash Flows
Cash flow from operations increased $1.9 billion to $11.1 billion for the six months ended December 31, 2009. This increase was due mainly to payment of approximately $3.1 billion to the Internal Revenue Service in the prior year as a result of our settlement of the 2000-2003 audit examination, offset in part by a decrease in cash received from customers in the current year.
Cash used for financing was $6.5 billion for the six months ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $2.6 billion from the corresponding period of the prior year. This decrease was due mainly to a $3.9 billion decrease in common stock repurchases, offset in part by a $1.7 billion decrease in net proceeds from debt and short-term borrowings.
Cash used in investing was $1.3 billion for the six months ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $613 million from the corresponding period of the prior year. This decrease reflects lower additions to property and equipment.
Share Repurchases
During the three months and six months ended December 31, 2009, we repurchased 125 million and 183 million shares of Microsoft common stock for $3.6 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, under the repurchase plan we announced on September 22, 2008. As of December 31, 2009, approximately $29.5 billion remained of the $40.0 billion approved repurchase amount. All repurchases were made using cash resources. The repurchase program expires September 30, 2013 but may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.

Other Planned Uses of Capital
We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.
We believe existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations, should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and share repurchases. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. In evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications in our financial statements.
RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE
Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance
On July 1, 2009, we adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) on business combinations. The guidance retains the fundamental requirements that the acquisition method of accounting (previously referred to as the purchase method of accounting) be used for all business combinations, but requires a number of changes, including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized and measured as a result of business combinations. It also requires the capitalization of in-process research and development at fair value and requires the expensing of acquisition-related costs as incurred. We have applied this guidance to business combinations completed since July 1, 2009.
On July 1, 2009, we adopted the guidance issued by the FASB that changes the accounting and reporting for non-controlling interests. Non-controlling interests are to be reported as a component of equity separate from the parent’s equity, and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control are to be accounted for as equity transactions. In addition, net income attributable to a non-controlling interest is to be included in net income and, upon a loss of control, the interest sold, as well as any interest retained, is to be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in net income. Adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
On July 1, 2009, we adopted the guidance on fair value measurement for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). Adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted
In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The guidance requires new disclosures on the transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 (quoted prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities) and Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) of the fair value measurement hierarchy, including the reasons and the timing of the transfers. Additionally, the guidance requires a roll forward of activities on purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 fair value measurements). The guidance will become effective for us with the reporting period beginning January 1, 2010, except for the disclosure on the roll forward activities for Level 3 fair value measurements, which will become effective for us with the reporting period beginning July 1, 2011. Other than requiring additional disclosures, adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
In October 2009, the FASB issued guidance on revenue recognition that will become effective for us beginning July 1, 2010, with earlier adoption permitted. Under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements, tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will no longer be within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance, and software-enabled products will now be subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance. Additionally, the FASB issued guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance. Under the new guidance, when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined, a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. The new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition. We believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities, which is effective for us beginning July 1, 2010. The new guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities, ongoing assessments of control over such entities, and additional disclosures for variable interests. We believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for contingencies, accounting for income taxes, accounting for stock-based compensation, and accounting for product warranties.

PART I
Item 2
 
Revenue Recognition
Software revenue recognition requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value exists for those elements.
A portion of the revenue related to Windows XP is recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements including, in some cases, free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. The amount of revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on the VSOE of fair value for those elements using the residual method or relative fair value method. Unearned revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related products’ life cycles. Revenue related to Windows Vista is not subject to a similar deferral because there are no significant undelivered elements. However, Windows Vista revenue is subject to deferral as a result of the Windows 7 Upgrade Option program which started June 26, 2009. The program allowed customers who purchased certain versions of Windows Vista to receive an upgrade to the corresponding version of Windows 7 at minimal or no cost. In addition, purchasers of retail packaged Windows Vista from participating retailers in participating markets may have qualified for a free or discounted upgrade to the equivalent Windows 7 product when the product became generally available in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010. Accordingly, previously deferred revenue related to the undelivered Windows 7 product sold was recognized in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 once the product had been delivered.
Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.
Impairment of Investment Securities
Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.

In connection with the disposal of Razorfish, we performed an interim impairment analysis of our Online Services Division goodwill balance during the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. No impairment of goodwill was identified.
Research and Development Costs
Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.
Legal and Other Contingencies
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements.
Income Taxes
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.
Product Warranties
We provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranty, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranty, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Note About Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements in Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”), other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “strategy,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section titled “Risk Factors” (refer to Part II, Item 1A). We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
OVERVIEW
The following MD&A is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2009 and the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes (“Notes”) included in this Form 10-Q.
We generate revenue by developing, manufacturing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products and services for many different types of computing devices. Our software products and services include operating systems for personal computers, servers, and intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; information worker productivity applications; business solutions applications; high-performance computing applications; software development tools; and video games. We provide consulting and product and solution support services, and we train and certify computer system integrators and developers. We also design and sell hardware, including the Xbox 360 video game console, the Zune digital music and entertainment device, and peripherals. Online offerings and information are delivered through Bing, Windows Live, Office Live, our MSN portals and channels, and the Microsoft Online Services platform, which includes offerings for businesses, such as Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online, Exchange Hosted Services, Exchange Online, and SharePoint Online. We enable the delivery of online advertising across our broad range of digital media properties and on Bing through our proprietary adCenter platform.
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Entertainment and Devices Division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, the Entertainment and Devices Division has generated over 40% of its yearly segment revenues in our second fiscal quarter. In addition, quarterly revenues may be impacted by the deferral of revenue. See the discussion below regarding the deferral of revenue related to Windows 7, which negatively impacted revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 and will positively impact revenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010.
All growth and percentage comparisons refer to the three months ended September 30, 2009, as compared with the three months ended September 30, 2008, unless otherwise noted.

Revenue declined across most segments, with the following primary contributing factors:
 
  •   
The Windows & Windows Live Division deferred approximately $1.5 billion of revenue (the “Windows 7 Deferral”) associated with sales of Windows Vista with a guarantee to be upgraded to Windows 7 at minimal or no cost (the “Windows 7 Upgrade Option”) and with sales of Windows 7 to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and retailers before general availability in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010.

 
  •   
Revenue from the Microsoft Business Division declined primarily as a result of 2007 Microsoft Office system licensing activity.

 
  •   
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $233 million or 2 percentage point decrease in revenue.

Operating income decreased primarily reflecting decreased revenue, offset in part by decreased operating expenses in all categories.
 
  •   
Sales and marketing expenses decreased $254 million or 8%, due mainly to an 8% decrease in headcount-related expenses and decreased corporate marketing and advertising campaigns. The decrease in headcount-related expenses was driven by reductions in employee headcount as a result of the resource management program implemented in early calendar year 2009.

 
  •   
Research and development decreased $218 million or 10%, primarily reflecting a 6% decrease in headcount-related expenses and capitalization of certain costs relating to development of Windows 7.

 
  •   
General and administrative expenses decreased $146 million or 16%, primarily due to a 16% decrease in headcount-related expenses and decreased legal expenses.

Diluted earnings per share declined primarily reflecting decreased net income, offset in part by share repurchases during the past 12 months. We repurchased 152 million shares during the 12 months ended September 30, 2009.
Global macroeconomic factors have a strong correlation to demand for our software, services, hardware, and online offerings. While we see the potential for improvement in calendar year 2010, the timing is uncertain. In the meantime, we are positive about our relative market position and our product delivery plans. In addition, we remain focused on executing in the areas we can control by continuing to provide high value products at the lowest total cost of ownership while managing our expenses.
SEGMENT PRODUCT REVENUE/OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)
The revenue and operating income (loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. Segment information appearing in Note 18 – Segment Information of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item I) is presented on a basis consistent with our current internal management reporting. Certain corporate-level activity has been excluded from segment operating results and is analyzed separately. We have recast certain prior period amounts within this section to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during the current period, including moving Windows Live from Online Services Division to Windows & Windows Live Division, Mobile Services from Online Services Division to Entertainment and Devices Division, and Razorfish from Online Services Division to Corporate.

Windows & Windows Live (“Windows”) Division offerings consist of premium and standard edition Windows operating systems and online software and services through Windows Live. Premium Windows operating systems are those that include additional functionality and are sold at a price above our standard editions. Premium editions include Windows 7 Home Premium, Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows Vista Business, Windows Vista Home Premium, Windows Vista Ultimate, Windows Vista Enterprise, Windows XP Professional, Windows XP Media Center, and Windows XP Tablet PC. Standard editions include Windows 7 Starter, Windows 7 Home Basic, Windows Vista Home Basic and Windows XP Home.
Windows Division revenue growth is directly impacted by growth of PC purchases from OEMs that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for approximately 80% of total Windows Division revenue, including the revenue deferred through the Windows 7 Deferral. The differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from year to year primarily result from changes in the mix of OEM Windows premium edition operating systems licensed as a percentage of total OEM Windows operating systems licensed (“OEM premium mix”). Additional differences in growth rates result from the impact of lower cost netbook PCs, which are sold with a lower cost version of Windows, changes in geographic mix, and changes in the channel mix of products sold by large, multi-national OEMs versus those sold by local and regional system builders. Windows Live primarily generates revenue from online advertising.
Windows Division revenue decreased primarily as a result of the deferral of approximately $1.5 billion of revenue related to the Windows 7 Upgrade Option and sales of Windows 7 to OEMs and retailers before general availability in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010. Including revenue and units associated with the Windows 7 Deferral, OEM revenue decreased $207 million or 6%, while OEM license units increased 6%. The decline in OEM revenue reflected the 8 percentage point decrease in the OEM premium mix to 63%, primarily driven by growth of licenses related to sales of netbook PCs, a decline in premium editions sold to business customers, and changes in geographic mix. Based on our estimates, total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew approximately 0% to 2% through growth in both emerging and developed markets.
Windows Division operating income decreased as a result of decreased revenue and increased cost of revenue, while other operating expenses declined year over year. Cost of revenue increased $40 million or 13%, primarily driven by increased traffic acquisition costs and other product costs. Research and development expenses decreased $47 million or 14%, primarily as a result of capitalization of certain Windows 7 software development costs and completion of product development of Windows 7. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $41 million or 8%, primarily reflecting decreased advertising and marketing campaigns.

Server and Tools licenses products, applications, tools, content, and services that are designed to make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. Server and Tools offerings consist of server software licenses and client access licenses (“CAL”) for Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, and other server products. We also offer developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier product support services, and Microsoft Consulting Services. Server products can be run on-site, in a partner-hosted environment, or in a Microsoft-hosted environment. We use multiple channels for licensing, including pre-installed OEM versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. Approximately 55% of Server and Tools revenue comes from multi-

year licensing agreements, approximately 25% is purchased through transactional volume licensing programs, fully packaged product and licenses sold to OEMs, and the remainder comes from consulting and product and solution support services.
Server and Tools revenue was flat, reflecting growth in product revenue offset by a decline in services revenue. Product revenue, which includes server and server application revenue (including CAL) and developer tools revenue, increased $29 million or 1%, primarily driven by growth in Enterprise CAL Suites and System Center revenue, partially offset by declines in Windows Server and developer tools revenue. The growth in product revenue reflects increased revenue from multi-year volume licensing agreements and continued adoption of Windows platform applications. Consulting and Premier product support services revenue declined $12 million or 2%, primarily due to decreased revenue from consulting services. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for an $81 million or two percentage point decrease in revenue.
Server and Tools operating income increased primarily due to decreases in all operating expense categories. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $106 million or 11%, primarily due to decreased headcount-related expenses of corporate sales force and outbound marketing spend. Cost of revenue decreased $69 million or 9%, reflecting the decline in demand for consulting services. Research and development expenses decreased $30 million or 6%, primarily driven by decreased vendor and headcount-related expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased $18 million or 18%, due to decreased headcount-related expenses.

Online Services Division (“OSD”) consists of an online advertising platform with offerings for both publishers and advertisers, online information offerings, such as Bing, and the MSN portals and channels around the world. We earn revenue primarily from online advertising, including search, display, and advertiser and publisher tools. Revenue is also generated through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services and from MSN narrowband Internet access subscribers (“Access”).
OSD revenue decreased as a result of decreased Access and online advertising revenue. Access revenue decreased $14 million or 28%, reflecting continued migration of subscribers to broadband or other competitively-priced service providers. Online advertising revenue decreased $14 million or 3%, to $421 million, primarily reflecting a decrease in advertiser and publisher tools revenue.
OSD operating loss increased mainly due to increased cost of revenue and decreased revenue, offset in part by decreased research and development expenses. Cost of revenue increased $177 million or 59%, primarily driven by increased online traffic acquisition costs. Research and development expenses decreased $39 million or 15%, primarily due to decreased vendor expenses.

Microsoft Business Division (“MBD”) offerings consist of the Microsoft Office system and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions. Microsoft Office system products are designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity through a range of programs, services, and software solutions. Microsoft Office system offerings generate over 90% of MBD revenue. Microsoft Dynamics products provide business solutions for financial management, customer relationship management, supply chain management, and analytics applications for small

and mid-size businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. We evaluate our results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business revenue, which includes Microsoft Office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and Microsoft Dynamics revenue; and consumer revenue, which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and OEM revenue.
MBD revenue decreased reflecting decreased consumer and business revenue, and included an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of $88 million or two percentage points. Consumer revenue decreased $390 million or 34%, primarily as a result of pricing promotions in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 that drove increased licensing in that period, a shift to lower-priced products, and a decline in licensing the 2007 Microsoft Office system. Business revenue decreased $161 million or 4%, primarily reflecting a decline in licensing the 2007 Microsoft Office system to transactional business customers and a 6% decrease in Microsoft Dynamics revenue, offset in part by growth in multi-year volume licensing agreement revenue. The growth in multi-year volume licensing agreement revenue primarily reflects recognition of deferred revenue from previously signed agreements.
MBD operating income decreased due mainly to decreased revenue, offset in part by decreased sales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $181 million or 18%, primarily driven by a decrease in corporate marketing activities and headcount-related costs associated with our corporate sales force.

Entertainment and Devices Division (“EDD”) offerings include the Xbox 360 platform (which includes the Microsoft Xbox 360 video game console system, Xbox 360 video games, Xbox Live, and Xbox 360 accessories), the Zune digital music and entertainment platform, PC software games, online games and services, Mediaroom (our Internet protocol television software), the Microsoft Surface computing platform, Windows Mobile and embedded device platforms, and other devices. EDD leads the development efforts for our line of consumer software and hardware products including application software for Apple’s Macintosh computers and Microsoft PC hardware products, and is responsible for all retail sales and marketing for Microsoft Office and Windows operating systems.
EDD revenue was flat with growth in Xbox 360 platform and PC game revenue offset by decreased revenue from the non-gaming portion of the business. Xbox 360 platform and PC game revenue increased by $96 million or 8% due mainly to increased revenue from Xbox Live and Xbox 360 video games, offset in part by decreased revenue per console resulting from price reductions during the past 12 months. We shipped 2.1 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, compared with 2.2 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. Non-gaming revenue decreased $98 million or 14%, primarily reflecting decreased sales of PC hardware products, Zune digital music and entertainment devices and services, and embedded device platforms. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $35 million or two percentage point decrease in revenue.
EDD operating income increased primarily due to decreased operating expenses. Cost of revenue decreased $103 million or 10%, primarily due to decreased Xbox 360 platform costs, offset in part by increased royalties to partners related to increased Xbox Live transactions. Other operating expenses decreased $51 million or 7%, primarily reflecting decreased headcount-related and outsourced expenses associated with research and development.

Dividends and interest income decreased primarily reflecting lower interest rates on our fixed-income investments. Net recognized gains on investments decreased as fewer securities in a gain position were sold in the current period. Other-than-temporary impairments were $18 million during the three months ended September 30, 2009, as compared with $72 million during the three months ended September 30, 2008 and decreased primarily due to improvements in market conditions. Net losses on derivatives decreased primarily due to gains on interest rate, commodity, and equity derivatives in the current period as compared with losses in the prior period. Net gains from foreign currency remeasurements compared to net losses in the prior period were due to a weakening U.S. dollar.
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rates were 25% and 27% for the three months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The fiscal year 2010 rate reflects a higher mix of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments
Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $36.7 billion as of September 30, 2009, compared with $31.4 billion as of June 30, 2009. Equity and other investments were $6.0 billion as of September 30, 2009, compared with $4.9 billion as of June 30, 2009. Our investments consist primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also includes foreign-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. We invest primarily in short-term securities to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation.

Item 2
 
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine fair value. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, U.S. treasuries, and agency securities. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and certain agency securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.
A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally labeled as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. Such controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.
While we own certain mortgage- and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of September 30, 2009 does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. The majority of the mortgage-backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and Government National Mortgage Association.
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Collateral and/or security interests received (securities pledged as collateral) are determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.
Debt
In September 2008, our Board of Directors authorized debt financings of up to $6.0 billion. Our initial commercial paper program provided for the issuance and sale of up to $2.0 billion. Subsequent to the issuance of our long-term debt in May 2009, we increased the commercial paper program and, during the current quarter, issued an additional $250 million of commercial paper. As of September 30, 2009, we had $2.25 billion of commercial paper and $3.75 billion of long-term debt issued and outstanding.
Short-term Debt
As of September 30, 2009, our $2.25 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding had a weighted average interest rate, including issuance costs, of 0.18% and maturities of 49 to 127 days. We also had two credit facilities aggregating $3.0 billion with no amounts drawn against them as of September 30, 2009. These facilities serve as a back-up for our commercial paper program. Our $2.0 billion and $1.0 billion credit facilities expire on November 6, 2009 and March 12, 2010, respectively. As of September 30, 2009, we were in compliance with the financial covenant in both credit agreements, which requires a coverage ratio maintained of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense.
Long-term Debt
As of September 30, 2009, we had issued and outstanding $3.75 billion of debt securities as follows: $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.95% notes due 2014, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.20% notes due 2019, and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.20% notes due 2039 (collectively “the Notes”). Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2009, to holders of record on the preceding May 15 and November 15. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding.

We are using the net proceeds from sales of the debt securities for general corporate purposes, which may include funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of our capital stock, and acquisitions.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements, revenue attributable to undelivered elements is recorded as unearned based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product’s life cycle. Undelivered elements include deferred revenue related to the Windows 7 Upgrade Option program and sales of Windows 7 to OEMs and retailers before general availability, unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis for Windows XP and prior versions, and free post-delivery telephone support. The cumulative Windows 7 deferral was $1.7 billion as of September 30, 2009. Other unearned revenue represents payments for post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future, online advertising for which the advertisement has yet to be displayed, Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products, Xbox Live subscriptions, Mediaroom, and other offerings for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.
The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of September 30, 2009:

Retained Deficit
As a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and common stock repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $21.1 billion at September 30, 2009. Our retained deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate, pay dividends, or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.
Cash Flows
Cash flow from operations increased $2.7 billion to $6.1 billion due mainly to payment of approximately $3.1 billion to the Internal Revenue Service in the prior year as a result of our settlement of the 2000-2003 audit examination, offset in part by a decrease in cash received from customers in the current year.
Cash used in financing decreased $3.1 billion to $2.2 billion due mainly to a $5.0 billion decrease in common stock repurchases year over year. This decrease in cash used was offset in part by a $1.6 billion decrease in net proceeds from short-term borrowings with maturities of 90 days or less.
Cash used in investing was $1.2 billion in the first three months of fiscal year 2010, as compared with cash from investing of $595 million in the first three months of fiscal year 2009, a change of $1.8 billion. This change reflected a net $5.9 billion decrease in cash from combined investment purchases, sales, and maturities, offset in part by a $3.4 billion increase in cash from securities lending payable activity.

Share Repurchases
During the three months ended September 30, 2009, we repurchased 58 million shares of Microsoft common stock for $1.4 billion under the repurchase plan we announced on September 22, 2008. As of September 30, 2009, approximately $33.1 billion remained of the $40.0 billion approved repurchase amount. All repurchases were made using cash resources.

Other Planned Uses of Capital
We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.
We believe existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations, should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and share repurchases. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. In evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications in our financial statements.
RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE
Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance
On July 1, 2009, we adopted authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) on business combinations. The guidance retains the fundamental requirements that the acquisition method of accounting (previously referred to as the purchase method of accounting) be used for all business combinations, but requires a number of changes, including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized and measured as a result of business combinations. It also requires the capitalization of in-process research and development at fair value and requires the expensing of acquisition-related costs as incurred. We have applied this guidance to business combinations completed since July 1, 2009.
On July 1, 2009, we adopted the authoritative guidance issued by the FASB that changes the accounting and reporting for non-controlling interests. Non-controlling interests are to be reported as a component of equity separate
 
PAGE      35

Item 2
 
from the parent’s equity, and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control are to be accounted for as equity transactions. In addition, net income attributable to a non-controlling interest is to be included in net income and, upon a loss of control, the interest sold, as well as any interest retained, is to be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in net income. Adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
On July 1, 2009, we adopted the authoritative guidance on fair value measurement for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). Adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted
In October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on revenue recognition that will become effective for us beginning July 1, 2010, with earlier adoption permitted. Under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements, tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will no longer be within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance, and software-enabled products will now be subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance. Additionally, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance. Under the new guidance, when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined, a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. The new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition. We believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities, which is effective for us beginning July 1, 2010. The new guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities, ongoing assessments of control over such entities, and additional disclosures for variable interests. We believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for contingencies, accounting for income taxes, accounting for stock-based compensation, and accounting for product warranties.
Revenue Recognition
Software revenue recognition requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value exists for those elements.
A portion of the revenue related to Windows XP is recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements including, in some cases, free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. The amount of revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on the VSOE of fair value for those elements using the residual method or relative fair value method. Unearned revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related products’ life cycles. Revenue related to Windows Vista is not subject to a similar deferral because there are no significant undelivered elements. However, Windows Vista revenue is subject to deferral as a result of the Windows 7 Upgrade Option program which started June 26, 2009. The program allows customers who purchase certain versions of Windows Vista to receive an upgrade to the corresponding version of Windows 7 at minimal or no cost. In addition, purchasers of retail packaged Windows Vista from participating retailers in participating markets may qualify for a free or discounted upgrade to the equivalent Windows 7 product when the product becomes generally available in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010. Accordingly, estimated revenue related to the undelivered Windows 7 product is deferred until the product is delivered.
 
PAGE      36
Table of Contents

PART I
Item 2
 
Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.
Impairment of Investment Securities
Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.
In connection with the planned disposal of Razorfish, we performed an interim impairment analysis of our Online Services Division goodwill balance during the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. No impairment of goodwill was identified.
Research and Development Costs
Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.
Legal and Other Contingencies
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position, or our cash flows.

PART I
Item 2, 3
 
Income Taxes
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.
Product Warranties
We provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranty, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranty, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.

OVERVIEW
The following MD&A is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements (“Notes”).
We generate revenue by developing, manufacturing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products and services for many different types of computing devices. Our software products and services include operating systems for personal computers, servers, and intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; information worker productivity applications; business solutions applications; high-performance computing applications; software development tools; and video games. We provide consulting and product support services, and we train and certify computer system integrators and developers. We also design and sell hardware including the Xbox 360 video game console, the Zune digital music and entertainment device, and peripherals. Online offerings and information are delivered through Live Search, Windows Live, Office Live, our MSN portals and channels, and the Microsoft Online Services platform, which includes offerings for businesses, such as Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online, Exchange Hosted Services, Exchange Online, and SharePoint Online. We enable the delivery of online advertising across our broad range of digital media properties and on Live Search through our proprietary adCenter® platform.
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Entertainment and Devices Division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, the Entertainment and Devices Division has generated over 40% of its yearly segment revenues in our second fiscal quarter.

Three months ended March 31, 2009 compared with three months ended March 31, 2008
Revenue declined across most segments driven primarily by continued weakness in the global PC market and the recessionary economic environment. Revenue from Windows operating systems decreased reflecting PC market weakness, especially PCs sold to businesses, and a continued shift to lower priced netbook PCs. Revenue from the 2007 Microsoft Office system decreased reflecting PC market weakness, a shift to lower-priced products, and pricing promotions, while online advertising revenue decreased primarily reflecting decreased display advertising. These decreases were partially offset by increased SQL Server and Windows Server revenue reflecting continued strength in our annuity business. Foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on revenue.
Operating income increased primarily reflecting decreased general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses, partially offset by decreased revenue, increased cost of revenue, and employee severance of $290 million. General and administrative expenses decreased $1.4 billion or 61%, primarily due to decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies, partially offset by increased headcount-related expenses. We incurred $57 million of legal charges during the three months and $90 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2009, as compared with $1.5 billion of legal charges during the three months and $1.8 billion during the nine months ended March 31, 2008. The fiscal year 2008 legal costs were primarily related to the European Commission fine of $1.4 billion (€899 million). Sales and marketing expenses decreased $293 million or 9%, primarily reflecting decreased corporate marketing and advertising campaigns and decreased professional consulting fees. Cost of revenue increased $300 million or 12%, primarily reflecting increased online costs (including traffic acquisition and people costs). Headcount-related expenses, excluding employee severance, increased 4%, reflecting a 9% increase in headcount during the past 12 months and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount.
In January 2009, we announced and implemented a resource management program to reduce discretionary operating expenses, employee headcount, and capital expenditures. As part of this program, we will eliminate up to 5,000 positions in research and development, marketing, sales, finance, legal, human resources, and information technology by June 30, 2010. During the three months ended March 31, 2009, we recorded employee severance charges of $290 million for the expected reduction in headcount. We reduced employee headcount by approximately 1,100 employees during the quarter.
Diluted earnings per share declined because other income (expense) was lower and the provision for income taxes grew, partially offset by share repurchases during the past 12 months. Other income (expense) decreased reflecting increased net recognized losses on investments due to higher other-than-temporary impairments and losses on investment sales. Provision for income taxes increased reflecting the fiscal year 2008 resolution of tax positions relating to our agreement with the Internal Revenue Service of the 2000-2003 examination.
Nine months ended March 31, 2009 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2008
Revenue grew primarily because of increased SQL Server and Windows Server revenue and increased licensing of the 2007 Microsoft Office system, partially offset by decreased revenue from

Windows operating systems as a result of PC market weakness and a continued shift to lower priced netbook PCs. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $705 million or two percentage point increase in revenue.
Operating income decreased primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses and cost of revenue, partially offset by decreased general and administrative expenses and increased revenue. Headcount-related expenses, excluding employee severance, increased 13%, reflecting a 9% increase in headcount during the past 12 months and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount. Cost of revenue increased $837 million or 10%, primarily reflecting increased online costs (including traffic acquisition, people, and data center and equipment costs) and increased costs associated with the growth in our consulting services. General and administrative expenses decreased $1.5 billion or 36%, primarily due to decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies, partially offset by increased headcount-related expenses.
Diluted earnings per share declined primarily reflecting decreased other income (expense), partially offset by share repurchases during the past 12 months. Other income (expense) decreased reflecting increased net losses on derivatives and foreign currency remeasurements.
Outlook
Demand for our software, services, hardware, and online offerings are correlated with global macroeconomic factors. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, we expect the trends seen in the third quarter to continue, including weakness in the PC and server hardware markets and in our non-annuity business. We will continue to focus on executing in the areas we can control by continuing to provide high value products at the lowest total cost of ownership while managing our expenses. We intend to reduce discretionary operating expenses, employee headcount, and capital expenditures. As part of the resource management program announced in January 2009, in addition to the reductions in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009, we will reduce employee headcount by approximately 3,400 employees by June 30, 2010, and will eliminate merit increases for employees in fiscal year 2010.

Vista Ultimate, Windows Vista Enterprise, Windows XP Professional, Windows XP Media Center Edition, and Windows XP Tablet PC Edition. Standard editions include Windows Vista Home Basic and Windows XP Home. Client revenue growth is directly impacted by growth of PC purchases from OEMs that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for over 80% of total Client revenue. The differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from year to year are affected primarily by changes in the mix of OEM Windows premium edition operating systems licensed as a percentage of total OEM Windows operating systems licensed (“OEM premium mix”). Additional differences in growth rates result from the impact from lower cost netbook PCs, which are sold with a lower cost version of Windows, changes in geographic mix, and changes in the channel mix of products sold by large, multi-national OEMs versus those sold by local and regional system builders.
Three months ended March 31, 2009 compared with three months ended March 31, 2008
Client revenue decreased primarily as a result of PC market weakness, especially PCs sold to businesses, and a continued shift to netbook PCs. OEM revenue decreased $637 million or 19%, while OEM license units decreased 6%. The decline in OEM revenue reflects a 14 percentage point decrease in the OEM premium mix to 62%, primarily driven by growth of licenses related to sales of netbook PCs, a decline in premium editions sold to business customers, and changes in geographic mix. Based on our estimates, total worldwide PC shipments from all sources declined approximately 7% to 9%, driven by decreased demand in emerging and mature markets.
Client operating income decreased primarily reflecting decreased revenue and increased research and development expenses, partially offset by decreased sales and marketing expenses. Research and development expenses increased $45 million or 17%, primarily driven by increased headcount-related expenses. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $52 million or 13%, primarily reflecting decreased corporate marketing activities and decreased headcount-related costs associated with our corporate sales force.
Nine months ended March 31, 2009 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2008
Client revenue decreased primarily as a result of PC market weakness and a continued shift to netbook PCs. OEM revenue decreased $1.1 billion or 11% while OEM license units remained flat. The decline in OEM revenue reflects a nine percentage point decrease in the OEM premium mix to 66%, primarily driven by growth of licenses related to sales of netbook PCs, a decline in premium editions sold to business customers, and changes in geographic mix. Revenue from commercial and retail licensing of Windows operating systems increased $246 million or 13%. Based on our estimates, total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew approximately 1% to 3%, driven by increased demand in emerging markets.
Client operating income decreased primarily reflecting decreased revenue and increased sales and marketing and research and development expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $149 million or 14%, primarily reflecting increased advertising and marketing campaigns. Research and development expenses increased $126 million or 16% as a result of increased headcount-related expenses.

Three months ended March 31, 2009 compared with three months ended March 31, 2008
Server and Tools revenue increased reflecting growth in product and services revenue. Server and server application revenue (including CAL) and developer tools revenue increased $191 million or 7%, primarily driven by growth in SQL Server, CAL Suites, and System Center revenue. This growth reflects recognition of deferred revenue from previously signed agreements and continued adoption of Windows Platform applications through SQL Server 2008, which was released in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, CAL Suites, and System Center products. Consulting and Premier and Professional product support services revenue increased $38 million or 6%, primarily due to revenue from annuity support agreements. Foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on revenue during the quarter.
Server and Tools operating income increased primarily due to growth in high-margin product revenue and a slight decline in operating expenses. Operating expenses decreased $35 million or 2%, primarily driven by a decrease in corporate marketing activities and headcount-related expenses associated with our corporate sales force.

EDD leads the development efforts for our line of consumer software and hardware products including application software for Apple’s Macintosh computers and Microsoft PC hardware products, and is responsible for all retail sales and marketing for Microsoft Office and the Windows operating systems.
Three months ended March 31, 2009 compared with three months ended March 31, 2008
EDD revenue decreased primarily due to decreased sales of application software for Apple’s Macintosh computers, partially offset by increased Xbox 360 platform and PC game revenue. The decrease in revenue included an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of $38 million or two percentage points. Sales of application software for Apple’s Macintosh computers declined 63%, reflecting the launch of Mac Office 2008 in the prior year as well as a decline in sales of Apple computers. Xbox 360 platform and PC game revenue increased 16%, primarily as a result of an increase in Xbox 360 platform sales, partially offset by decreased revenue per Xbox 360 console due to price reductions during the past 12 months. We shipped 1.7 million Xbox 360 consoles during the third quarter of fiscal year 2009, compared with 1.3 million Xbox 360 consoles during the third quarter of fiscal year 2008.
EDD operating income decreased primarily due to increased research and development expenses and cost of revenue. Research and development expenses increased $66 million or 18%, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses associated with the Windows Mobile device platform. Cost of revenue increased $52 million or 6%, primarily driven by increased costs associated with the Xbox 360 platform, reflecting the increase in console and video game sales.
Nine months ended March 31, 2009 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2008
EDD revenue decreased primarily due to decreased Xbox 360 platform and PC game revenue and included an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of $47 million or one percentage point. Xbox 360 platform and PC game revenue decreased $51 million or 1%, primarily as a result of decreased revenue per Xbox 360 console as a result of price reductions during the past 12 months.

Certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments. Those results include expenses such as broad-based sales and marketing, product support services, human resources, legal, finance, information technology, corporate development and procurement activities, research and development and other costs, legal settlements and contingencies, and employee severance. Corporate-level expenses decreased during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009, primarily due to decreased legal costs, partially offset by employee severance charges of $290 million and increased headcount-related expenses. We incurred $57 million of legal charges during the three months and $90 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2009, as compared with $1.5 billion of legal charges during the three months and $1.8 billion during the nine months ended March 31, 2008. The fiscal year 2008 legal costs were primarily related to the European Commission fine of $1.4 billion (€899 million).

Sales and marketing expenses decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2009, primarily as a result of decreased corporate marketing and advertising campaigns and decreased professional consulting fees. Sales and marketing expenses increased during the nine months ended March 31, 2009, primarily as a result of increased headcount-related expenses. Headcount-related expenses decreased 3% during the three months and increased 6% during the nine ended March 31, 2009.

program, we will eliminate up to 5,000 positions in research and development, marketing, sales, finance, legal, human resources, and information technology by June 30, 2010. During the three months ended March 31, 2009, we recorded employee severance charges of $290 million for the expected reduction in headcount. We reduced employee headcount by approximately 1,100 employees during the quarter.

Effective July 1, 2008, we began presenting gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of other income (expense). Prior to July 1, 2008, we included gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of sales and marketing expense. We changed our presentation because this better reflects how we manage these foreign currency exposures, as such gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are incidental to our operations. For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009, $26 million and $555 million of losses, respectively, were reported as other income (expense).

Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary. We employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments, including market declines subsequent to the period-end. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, among other factors, we evaluate general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Collateral and/or security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.

We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized in other income (expense). These are generally offset by unrealized gains and losses in the underlying securities in the investment portfolio and are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income.
Three months ended March 31, 2009 compared with three months ended March 31, 2008
Dividends and interest income decreased primarily reflecting lower interest rates on our fixed-income investments. Net recognized losses on investments increased due to higher other-than-temporary impairments and losses on investment sales. Other-than-temporary impairments were $420 million during the three months ended March 31, 2009, as compared with $179 million during the three months ended March 31, 2008 and increased primarily due to declines in equity values as a result of continuing deterioration in equity markets. Net losses on derivatives increased primarily due to losses on equity and commodity derivatives in the current period as compared with gains in the prior period. Net losses on foreign currency remeasurements increased due to current period volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
Nine months ended March 31, 2009 compared with Nine months ended March 31, 2008
Dividends and interest income decreased primarily reflecting lower interest rates on our fixed-income investments. Net recognized losses on investments increased primarily due to higher other-than-temporary impairments that were partially offset by sales of certain equity investments held in our strategic investments portfolio. Other-than-temporary impairments were $754 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2009, as compared with $248 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2008 and increased primarily due to declines in equity values as a result of continuing deterioration in equity markets. Net losses on derivatives increased primarily due to losses on equity, commodity, and interest rate derivatives in the current period as compared with gains in the prior period. Net losses on foreign currency remeasurements increased due to current period volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Other expense of $142 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2008 included the correction of several immaterial items from prior periods.
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate was 27% for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2009. Our effective tax rates were 9% for the three months and 25% for the nine months ended March 31, 2008. The fiscal year 2008 rates were lower primarily due to the resolution of tax positions relating to our agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) settling the 2000-2003 examination. As a result of this settlement, we paid the IRS approximately $3.1 billion during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $25.3 billion as of March 31, 2009, compared with $23.7 billion as of June 30, 2008. Equity and other investments were $4.1 billion as of March 31, 2009, compared with $6.6 billion as of June 30, 2008. Our investments consist primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also includes foreign-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. We invest primarily in short-term securities to facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs. As a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased,

our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $25.0 billion at March 31, 2009. Our retained deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate, pay dividends, or repay our short-term debt given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine fair value. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, U.S. treasuries, and agency securities. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and certain agency securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.
A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally labeled as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. Such controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.
While we own certain mortgage- and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of March 31, 2009 does not contain significant exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. The majority of the mortgage-backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and Government National Mortgage Association.
Debt
In September 2008, our Board of Directors authorized debt financings of up to $6.0 billion. Pursuant to the authorization, we established a commercial paper program providing for the issuance and sale of up to $2.0 billion in short-term commercial paper. As of March 31, 2009, $2.0 billion of the commercial paper was issued and outstanding with a weighted average interest rate, including issuance costs, of 0.24% and maturities of 31 to 181 days.
In September 2008, we also entered into a $2.0 billion six-month senior unsecured credit facility, principally to support the commercial paper program. In November 2008, we replaced the six-month credit facility with a $2.0 billion 364-day credit facility. This credit facility expires on November 6, 2009. In March 2009, we entered into an additional credit facility. This $1.0 billion 364-day credit facility expires on March 12, 2010. As of March 31, 2009, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in both credit agreements, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense. No amounts were drawn against the credit facilities during the nine months ended March 31, 2009.

In November 2008, we filed a shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that allows us to issue debt securities from time to time pursuant to the September 2008 authorization for debt financings of up to $6.0 billion. As of March 31, 2009, no debt securities had been issued under that registration statement.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements, revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis for Windows XP and previous PC operating systems, is recorded as unearned based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately, and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product’s life cycle. Other unearned revenue includes services, Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products, Xbox Live subscriptions, display advertising, Mediaroom, and other offerings for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.

Cash Flows
Cash flow from operations decreased $2.3 billion from the first nine months of fiscal year 2008 to $15.2 billion due to payment of approximately $3.1 billion to the IRS during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 as a result of our settlement of the 2000-2003 audit examination.
Cash used for financing was $10.2 billion in the first nine months of fiscal year 2009, an increase of $2.3 billion from the corresponding period in fiscal year 2008. The increase reflected $9.3 billion of common stock repurchases in the first nine months of fiscal year 2009, compared with $8.2 billion in the first nine months of fiscal year 2008 and a $2.8 billion decrease in proceeds from issuance of common stock. These impacts were partially offset by a $2.0 billion increase in cash proceeds from our commercial paper program established in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009.
Cash used for investing was $7.9 billion in the first nine months of fiscal year 2009, an increase of $3.8 billion from the first nine months of fiscal year 2008. The increase reflected a $5.7 billion rise in purchases of investments along with a combined $3.4 billion decrease in cash provided by sales of investments and securities lending. These impacts were partially offset by a $5.1 billion decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of companies, attributable to the purchase of aQuantive in fiscal year 2008.

While we have short-term debt as described above, we currently have no long-term debt (see Financial Condition above). Stockholders’ equity at March 31, 2009 was $36.9 billion. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.
On September 22, 2008, we announced the completion of the two repurchase programs approved by our Board of Directors during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 to buy back up to $40.0 billion of Microsoft common stock. On September 22, 2008, we also announced that our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases with an expiration date of September 30, 2013. We did not repurchase any shares during the three months and repurchased 318 million shares for $8.2 billion during the nine months ended March 31, 2009; 101 million shares were repurchased for $2.7 billion under the repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 and 217 million shares were repurchased for $5.5 billion under the repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. While we did not repurchase any shares during the three months ended March 31, 2009, $18 million of shares were withheld to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations on employee stock awards which vested during the quarter. These share withholdings are included as common stock repurchases in the cash flows and stockholders’ equity statements in Part I, Item I. As of March 31, 2009, approximately $34.5 billion remained of the $40.0 billion approved repurchase amount. All repurchases were made using cash resources. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.
Our Board of Directors declared the following dividends:

We believe existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations, should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and share repurchases. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others – an interpretation of FASB statements No.5, 57 and 107 and rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34. We consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any material liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
On January 1, 2009, we adopted SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133. SFAS No. 161 requires additional disclosures about the Company’s objectives in using derivative instruments and hedging activities, the method of accounting for such instruments under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and its related interpretations, and tabular disclosures of the effects of such instruments and related hedged items on our financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. See Note 5 – Derivatives.
On July 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, for all financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. See Note 4 – Financial Instruments.
SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities-Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, became effective for us on July 1, 2008. SFAS No. 159 gives us the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for certain financial assets and liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis with the difference between the carrying value before election of the fair value option and the fair value recorded upon election as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings. As of March 31, 2009, we had not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial asset or liability.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In April 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued three Staff Positions (“FSPs”) that are intended to provide additional application guidance and enhance disclosures about fair value measurements and impairments of securities. FSP FAS 157-4 clarifies the objective and method of fair value measurement even when there has been a significant decrease in market activity for the asset being measured. FSP FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2 establishes a new model for measuring other-than-temporary impairments for debt securities, including establishing criteria for when to recognize a write-down through earnings versus other comprehensive income. FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1 expands the fair value disclosures required for all financial instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, to interim periods. All of these FSPs are effective for us beginning April 1, 2009. We are assessing the potential impact that the

adoption of FSP FAS 157-4 and FSP FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2 may have on our financial statements. FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1 will result in increased disclosures in our interim periods.
In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 to July 1, 2009 for us, for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We believe the adoption of the delayed items of SFAS No. 157 will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations, which replaces SFAS No. 141. The statement retains the fundamental requirements in SFAS No. 141 that the acquisition method of accounting (previously referred to as the purchase method of accounting) be used for all business combinations, but requires a number of changes, including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized as a result of business combinations. It also requires the capitalization of in-process research and development at fair value and requires the expensing of acquisition-related costs as incurred. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 141(R)-1 which amends SFAS No. 141(R) by establishing a model to account for certain preacquisition contingencies. Under the FSP, an acquirer is required to recognize at fair value an asset acquired or a liability assumed in a business combination that arises from a contingency if the acquisition-date fair value of that asset or liability can be determined during the measurement period. If the acquisition-date fair value cannot be determined, then the acquirer should follow the recognition criteria in SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, and FASB Interpretation No. 14, Reasonable Estimation of the Amount of a Loss – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 5. SFAS No. 141(R) and FSP FAS 141(R)-1 are effective for us beginning July 1, 2009, and will apply prospectively to business combinations completed on or after that date. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) and FSP FAS 141(R)-1 will depend on the nature of acquisitions completed after the date of adoption.
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements – an amendment of ARB No. 51, which changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests. Minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and will be reported as a component of equity separate from the parent’s equity, and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control will be accounted for as equity transactions. In addition, net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in net income and, upon a loss of control, the interest sold, as well as any interest retained, will be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in net income. SFAS No. 160 is effective for us beginning July 1, 2009 and will apply prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which will apply retrospectively. We believe the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for contingencies, accounting for income taxes, accounting for stock-based compensation, and accounting for product warranties.
We account for the licensing of software in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (“SOP”) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. The application of SOP 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements,
 
43
Table of Contents

and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value exists for those elements. For some of our products, customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. These elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. The fair value of these elements is recognized over the estimated life cycle for the Windows XP and previous PC operating systems. For Windows Vista, there are no significant undelivered elements and accordingly, no license revenue is deferred for Windows Vista sales. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.
SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5M, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, provides guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2009, we changed the date of our annual impairment test from July 1 to May 1. During fiscal year 2009, the annual impairment test was performed as of July 1, 2008 and will be performed again as of May 1, 2009. The change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with our long-range planning and forecasting process. We believe the resulting change in accounting principle related to changing the annual impairment testing date will not delay, accelerate, or avoid an impairment charge. We have determined that this change in accounting principle is preferable under the circumstances and does not result in adjustments to our financial
 
44
Table of Contents

statements when applied retrospectively. The impact of the new impairment testing date, if material, will be disclosed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, which is the quarter in which the new testing date will occur.
Given the continuing deterioration of economic conditions, we performed an interim impairment analysis of certain goodwill balances during the three months ended December 31, 2008 (goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach). No impairment of goodwill was identified during the interim testing, nor has an impairment of goodwill been identified during any of the periods presented.
We account for research and development costs in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements, including SFAS No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, and SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS No. 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing.
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position, or our cash flows.
SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the requirements of FASB Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. Under FIN 48, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over
 
45
Table of Contents

the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted.
We account for product warranties in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. We provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranty, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranty, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.

OVERVIEW
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements (“Notes”).
We generate revenue by developing, manufacturing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products and services for many different types of computing devices. Our software products and services include operating systems for personal computers, servers, and intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; information worker productivity applications; business solutions applications; high-performance computing applications; software development tools; and video games. We provide consulting and product support services, and we train and certify computer system integrators and developers. We also design and sell hardware including the Xbox 360 video game console, the Zune digital music and entertainment device, and peripherals. Online offerings and information are delivered through Live Search, Windows Live, Office Live, our MSN portals and channels, and the Microsoft Online Services platform which includes offerings for businesses such as Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online, Exchange Hosted Services, Exchange Online, and SharePoint Online. We enable the delivery of online advertising across our broad range of digital media properties and on Live Search through our proprietary adCenter® platform.
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Entertainment and Devices Division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, the Entertainment and Devices Division has generated over 40% of its yearly segment revenues in our second fiscal quarter.

Three months ended December 31, 2008 compared with three months ended December 31, 2007
Revenue growth was driven primarily by increased SQL Server and Windows Server revenue and increased Xbox 360 platform revenue, substantially offset by decreased revenue from Windows operating systems as a result of PC market weakness and a continued shift to lower priced netbook PCs. Revenue growth included a favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of $222 million or one percentage point.
Operating income decreased primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses and increased cost of revenue, partially offset by increased revenue. Headcount-related expenses increased 12%, reflecting a 14% increase in headcount during the past 12 months and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount. Cost of revenue increased $364 million or 10%, reflecting increased online costs, including traffic acquisition and people costs, and increased Xbox 360 platform costs.
Diluted earnings per share declined primarily reflecting decreased other income (expense), partially offset by a decrease in provision for income taxes and share repurchases. Other income (expense) decreased reflecting increased net losses on derivatives and foreign currency remeasurements. Provision for income taxes decreased reflecting a decline in the recurring effective tax rate primarily as a result of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates.
Six months ended December 31, 2008 compared with six months ended December 31, 2007
Revenue growth was driven primarily by increased SQL Server and Windows Server revenue and increased licensing of the 2007 Microsoft Office system, partially offset by decreased revenue from Windows operating systems as a result of PC market weakness and a continued shift to lower priced netbook PCs. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $660 million or two percentage point increase in revenue.
Operating income decreased primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses and cost of revenue, partially offset by increased revenue. Headcount-related expenses increased 17%, reflecting a 14% increase in headcount during the past 12 months and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount. Cost of revenue increased $537 million or 9%, reflecting increased online costs, including traffic acquisition, data center and equipment, and people costs, and increased costs associated with the growth in our consulting services, partially offset by decreased Xbox 360 platform costs.
Diluted earnings per share declined primarily reflecting decreased other income (expense), partially offset by a decrease in provision for income taxes and share repurchases.

Outlook
Demand for our software, services, hardware, and online offerings are correlated with global macroeconomic factors. For the remainder of fiscal year 2009, we expect the economic conditions experienced during the first six months to further deteriorate. Given this, we are focused on executing in the areas we can control by continuing to provide high value products at the lowest total cost of ownership while managing our expenses.
On January 22, 2009, we announced a resource management program which includes a reduction in operating expenses, employee headcount, and capital expenditures. We plan to eliminate up to 5,000 jobs in research and development, marketing, sales, finance, legal, human resources, and IT, including 1,400 jobs this month. The net headcount in these functions is expected to decline by 2,000 to 3,000 over the next 18 months. Merit increases will be eliminated for employees in fiscal year 2010. Operating expenses will be reduced by cutting travel expenditures, reducing spending on vendors and contingent staff, reducing marketing spending, and scaling back capital expenditures. These initiatives will reduce our annual operating expense run rate by approximately $1.5 billion.
These plans are being finalized, and the costs of implementation and employee severance will be included in our third quarter results of operations.
SEGMENT PRODUCT REVENUE/OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)
Revenue and operating income (loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. Segment information appearing in Note 15 – Segment Information is presented on a basis consistent with our current internal management reporting, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.

Client offerings consist of premium and standard edition Windows operating systems. Premium editions are those that include additional functionality and are sold at a price above our standard editions. Premium editions include Windows Vista Business, Windows Vista Home Premium, Windows Vista Ultimate, Windows Vista Enterprise, Windows XP Professional, Windows XP Media Center Edition, and Windows XP Tablet PC Edition. Standard editions include Windows Vista Home Basic and Windows XP Home. Client revenue growth is directly impacted by growth of PC purchases from OEMs that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for over 80% of total Client revenue. The differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from year to year are affected by changes in the mix of OEM Windows operating systems licensed with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total OEM Windows operating systems licensed (“OEM premium mix”), including the impact from lower cost netbook PCs which are sold with a lower cost version of Windows, changes in the geographic mix, and changes in the channel mix of products sold by large, multi-national OEMs versus those sold by local and regional system builders.

Microsoft Business Division (“MBD”) offerings consist of the Microsoft Office system and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions. Microsoft Office system products are designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity through a range of programs, services, and software solutions. Growth of revenue from the Microsoft Office system offerings, which generate over 90% of MBD revenue, depends on our ability to add value to the core Office product set and to continue to expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as enterprise content management, collaboration, unified communications, and business intelligence. Microsoft Dynamics products provide business solutions for financial management, customer relationship management, supply chain management, and analytics applications for small and mid-size businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. We evaluate our results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business revenue, which includes Microsoft Office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and Microsoft Dynamics revenue; and consumer revenue, which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and OEM revenue.

$167 million or four percentage points. Business revenue increased $285 million or 7%, primarily reflecting growth in volume licensing agreement revenue and included a 7% decrease in Microsoft Dynamics customer billings. The growth in volume licensing agreement revenue primarily reflects recognition of deferred revenue from previously signed agreements. Consumer revenue decreased $224 million or 23%, primarily as a result of decreased licensing of the 2007 Microsoft Office system through our OEM channel.
MBD operating income decreased reflecting increased research and development expenses and cost of revenue, partially offset by increased revenue. Research and development expenses increased $54 million or 15%, primarily driven by an increase in headcount-related expenses associated with the April 2008 acquisition of Fast Search & Transfer ASA (“FAST”). Cost of revenue increased $46 million or 20%, primarily driven by FAST.

EDD operating income decreased primarily due to increased cost of revenue, research and development expenses, and sales and marketing expenses, partially offset by increased revenue. Cost of revenue increased $139 million or 7%, primarily driven by increased costs associated with the Xbox 360 platform reflecting the increase in console and video game sales. Research and development expenses increased $106 million or 29%, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses associated with the Windows Mobile device platform. Sales and marketing expenses increased $83 million or 19%, primarily reflecting an increase in product advertising and channel marketing.
Six months ended December 31, 2008 compared with six months ended December 31, 2007
EDD revenue decreased primarily due to decreased Xbox 360 platform and PC game revenue, partially offset by increases in other EDD product revenue. Xbox 360 platform and PC game revenue decreased $196 million or 5%, primarily as a result of the $330 million of incremental revenue from the launch of Halo 3 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 and decreased revenue per Xbox 360 console as a result of price reductions during the past 12 months. We shipped 8.3 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first half of fiscal year 2009 compared with 6.1 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first half of fiscal year 2008. Other EDD product revenue increased $169 million or 15%, led by increased sales of application software for Apple’s Macintosh computers and mobile and embedded device platforms.
EDD operating income decreased primarily due to increased research and development expenses, partially offset by decreased cost of revenue. Research and development expenses increased $251 million or 37%, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses associated with the Windows Mobile device platform, driven by recent acquisitions.

Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. We employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments, including market declines subsequent to the period-end. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, among other factors, we evaluate general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Collateral and/or security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.
We use derivative instruments to manage exposures to interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency markets, and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses arising from derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are in large part economically offset by unrealized losses and gains, respectively, in the underlying securities which are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income.
Three months ended December 31, 2008 compared with three months ended December 31, 2007
Dividends and interest income decreased primarily reflecting lower interest rates on our fixed-income investments. Net recognized gains on investments, which included other-than-temporary impairments of $262 million during the three months ended December 31, 2008, as compared with $54 million during the three months ended December 31, 2007, increased primarily due to sales of certain equity investments held in our strategic investments portfolio. Other-than-temporary impairments increased primarily due to declines in equity values as a result of continuing declines in equity markets. Net losses on derivatives increased primarily due to losses on equity, commodity, and interest rate derivatives in the current period as compared to gains in the prior period. Net losses on foreign currency remeasurements increased due to current period volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
Six months ended December 31, 2008 compared with six months ended December 31, 2007
Dividends and interest income decreased primarily reflecting lower interest rates on our fixed-income investments. Net recognized gains on investments, which included other-than-temporary impairments of $334 million during the six months ended December 31, 2008, as compared with $69 million during the six months ended December 31, 2007, increased primarily due to sales of certain equity investments held in our strategic investments portfolio. Other-than-temporary impairments increased primarily due to declines in equity values as a result of continuing declines in equity markets. Net losses on derivatives increased primarily due to losses on equity, commodity, and interest rate derivatives in the current period as compared to gains in the prior period. Net losses on foreign currency remeasurements increased due to current period volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Other of $136 million for the six months ended December 31, 2007 included the correction of several immaterial items from prior periods.
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rates were 26% for the three months and 27% for the six months ended December 31, 2008, and 31% for the three and six months ended December 31, 2007. The fiscal year 2009 rates reflected a decline in the recurring effective tax rates primarily as a result of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates.

During the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, we paid the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) approximately $3.1 billion as a result of our settlement with the IRS on its 2000-2003 examination.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $20.7 billion as of December 31, 2008, compared with $23.7 billion as of June 30, 2008. Equity and other investments were $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2008, compared with $6.6 billion as of June 30, 2008. Our investments consist primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also includes foreign-denominated securities in order to diversify financial risk. We invest primarily in short-term securities to facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs. As a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $26.9 billion at December 31, 2008. Our retained deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate, pay dividends, or repay our short-term debt given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine fair value. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, U.S. treasuries, and agency securities. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and certain agency securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.
A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally labeled as Level 2 investments because the brokers price these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. Such controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.
While we own certain mortgage- and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of December 31, 2008 does not contain significant exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. The majority of the mortgage-backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and Government National Mortgage Association.
Debt
In September 2008, our Board of Directors authorized debt financings of up to $6.0 billion. Pursuant to the authorization, we established a commercial paper program providing for the issuance
 
35
Table of Contents

and sale of up to $2.0 billion in short-term commercial paper. As of December 31, 2008, $2.0 billion of the commercial paper was issued and outstanding with a weighted average interest rate, including issuance costs, of 0.3% and maturities of 29 to 93 days.
In September 2008, we also entered into a $2.0 billion six-month senior unsecured credit facility, principally to support the commercial paper program. In November 2008, we replaced the six-month credit facility with a new $2.0 billion 364-day credit facility. The new credit facility expires on November 6, 2009. As of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in the credit agreement, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense. No amounts were drawn against the credit facility during the three months ended December 31, 2008.
In November 2008, we filed a shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that allows us to issue debt securities from time to time pursuant to the September 2008 authorization for debt financings of up to $6.0 billion. As of December 31, 2008, no debt securities had been issued under this registration statement.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements, revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis for Windows XP and previous PC operating systems, is recorded as unearned based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately, and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product’s life cycle. Other unearned revenue includes services, Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products, Xbox Live subscriptions, display advertising, Mediaroom, and other offerings for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.

2009 as a result of our settlement of the 2000-2003 audit examination. This impact was partially offset by an increase in cash received from customers, including an increase of $2.1 billion from conversion of accounts receivable.
Cash used for financing was $9.1 billion in the first six months of fiscal year 2009, an increase of $3.2 billion from the corresponding period in fiscal year 2008. The increase reflected $9.3 billion of common stock repurchases in the first six months of fiscal year 2009, compared with $7.0 billion in the first six months of fiscal year 2008 and a $2.7 billion decrease in proceeds from issuance of common stock. These impacts were partially offset by a $2.0 billion increase in cash proceeds from our commercial paper program established in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009.
Cash used for investing was $1.9 billion in the first six months of fiscal year 2009, a decrease of $1.4 billion from the first six months of fiscal year 2008. The decrease reflected a $5.0 billion decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of companies, resulting from the purchase of aQuantive in the first half of fiscal year 2008, partially offset by a $1.6 billion decline in cash from securities lending activities and a $1.6 billion decrease in cash from combined investment purchases, sales, and maturities.
While we have short-term debt as described above, we currently have no long-term debt (see Financial Condition above). Stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2008 was $34.5 billion. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.
On September 22, 2008, we announced the completion of the two repurchase programs approved by our Board of Directors during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 to buy back up to $40.0 billion of Microsoft common stock. On September 22, 2008, we also announced that our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases with an expiration of September 30, 2013. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased a total of 94 million and 318 million shares for $2.2 billion and $8.2 billion, respectively; 101 million shares were repurchased for $2.7 billion under the repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 and 217 million shares were repurchased for $5.5 billion under the repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. As of December 31, 2008, approximately $34.5 billion remained of the $40.0 billion approved repurchase amount. All repurchases were made using cash resources. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.
Our Board of Directors declared the following dividends:

We believe existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations, should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and share repurchases. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others – an interpretation of FASB statements No.5, 57 and 107 and rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34. We consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any material liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
On July 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements for all financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. See Note 4 – Financial Instruments.
SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, became effective for us on July 1, 2008. SFAS No. 159 gives us the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for certain financial assets and liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis with the difference between the carrying value before election of the fair value option and the fair value recorded upon election as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings. As of December 31, 2008, we had not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial asset or liability.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities – an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133, which requires additional disclosures about the objectives of derivative instruments and hedging activities, the method of accounting for such instruments under SFAS No. 133 and its related interpretations, and a tabular disclosure of the effects of such instruments and related hedged items on our financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2009. We believe the adoption of SFAS No. 161 will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 to July 1, 2009 for us, for all nonfinancial

Table of Contents

assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We believe the adoption of the delayed items of SFAS No. 157 will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations, which replaces SFAS No. 141. The statement retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions, but requires a number of changes, including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized in the purchase accounting. It also requires the capitalization of in-process research and development at fair value and requires the expensing of acquisition-related costs as incurred. SFAS No. 141R is effective for us beginning July 1, 2009 and will apply prospectively to business combinations completed on or after that date. The impact of SFAS No. 141R will depend on the nature of acquisitions completed after adoption.
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements – an amendment of ARB No. 51, which changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests. Minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and will be reported as a component of equity separate from the parent’s equity, and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control will be accounted for as equity transactions. In addition, net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income and, upon a loss of control, the interest sold, as well as any interest retained, will be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in net income. SFAS No. 160 is effective for us beginning July 1, 2009 and will apply prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which will apply retrospectively. We believe the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for contingencies, accounting for income taxes, accounting for stock-based compensation, and accounting for product warranties.
We account for the licensing of software in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (“SOP”) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. The application of SOP 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value exists for those elements. For some of our products, customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. These elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. The fair value of these elements is recognized over the estimated life cycle for the Windows XP and previous PC operating systems. For Windows Vista, there are no significant undelivered elements and accordingly, no license revenue is deferred for Windows Vista sales. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.
SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5M, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, provides guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. Investments are
 
39
Table of Contents

reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2009, we changed the date of our annual impairment test from July 1 to May 1. During fiscal year 2009, the annual impairment test was performed as of July 1, 2008 and will be performed again as of May 1, 2009. The change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with our long-range planning and forecasting process. We believe the resulting change in accounting principle related to changing the annual impairment testing date will not delay, accelerate, or avoid an impairment charge. We have determined that this change in accounting principle is preferable under the circumstances and does not result in adjustments to our financial statements when applied retrospectively. The impact of the new impairment testing date, if material, will be disclosed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, which is the quarter in which the new testing date will occur.
Given the continuing deterioration of economic conditions, we performed an interim impairment analysis of certain goodwill balances during the three months ended December 31, 2008 (goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach). No impairment of goodwill was identified during the interim testing, nor has an impairment of goodwill been identified during any of the periods presented.
We account for research and development costs in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements, including SFAS No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, and SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS No. 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for
 
40
Table of Contents

the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing.
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position, or our cash flows.
SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the requirements of FASB Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”) Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. Under FIN 48, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted.
We account for product warranties in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. We provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranty, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranty, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements in Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”), other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “strategy,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section titled “Risk Factors” (refer to Part II, Item 1A). We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
OVERVIEW
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements (“Notes”).
We generate revenue by developing, manufacturing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products and services for many different types of computing devices. Our software products and services include operating systems for personal computers, servers, and intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; information worker productivity applications; business solutions applications; high-performance computing applications; software development tools; and video games. We provide consulting and product support services, and we train and certify computer system integrators and developers. We also design and sell hardware including the Xbox 360 video game console, the Zune digital music and entertainment device, and peripherals. Online offerings and information are delivered through Live Search, Windows Live, Office Live, our MSN portals and channels, and the Microsoft Online Services platform which includes offerings for businesses such as Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online, Exchange Hosted Services, Exchange Online, and SharePoint Online. We enable the delivery of online advertising across our broad range of digital media properties and on Live Search through our proprietary adCenter® platform.
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Entertainment and Devices Division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, the Entertainment and Devices Division has generated over 40% of its yearly segment revenues in our second fiscal quarter.
All growth and percentage comparisons refer to the three months ended September 30, 2008, as compared with the three months ended September 30, 2007, unless otherwise noted.

Revenue growth was driven primarily by increased licensing of the 2007 Microsoft Office system and increased revenue associated with Windows Server and SQL Server. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $439 million or three percentage point increase in revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2008.
Operating income increased primarily reflecting increased revenue, partially offset by increased headcount-related expenses and increased cost of revenue. Headcount-related expenses increased 22%, reflecting a 14% increase in headcount during the past 12 months and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount. Cost of revenue increased $173 million or 6%, reflecting increased data center and equipment costs, online content expenses, and increased costs associated with the growth in our consulting services, partially offset by decreased Xbox 360 manufacturing costs.
Diluted earnings per share growth was impacted favorably by share repurchases.
Demand for our software, services, hardware, and online offerings are correlated with global macroeconomic factors. For the remainder of fiscal year 2009, we expect the economic conditions experienced during the first quarter to broadly continue. We are monitoring economic conditions and have three major areas of focus: continuing to provide high value products at the lowest total cost of ownership, increasing focus on our expense management, and prioritizing our investment dollars in key strategic opportunities to enable us to manage our business for the long term.
SEGMENT PRODUCT REVENUE/OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)
Revenue and operating income (loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. Segment information appearing in Note 15 – Segment Information is presented on a basis consistent with our current internal management reporting, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Certain corporate-level activity has been excluded from segment operating results and is analyzed separately. Prior period amounts have been recast to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored performance at the segment level during the current period.

Client offerings consist of premium and standard edition Windows operating systems. Premium editions are those that include additional functionality and are sold at a price above our standard editions. Premium editions include Windows Vista Business, Windows Vista Home Premium, Windows Vista Ultimate, Windows Vista

Table of Contents

Enterprise, Windows XP Professional, Windows XP Media Center Edition, and Windows XP Tablet PC Edition. Standard editions include Windows Vista Home Basic and Windows XP Home. Client revenue growth generally correlates with the growth of PC purchases from OEMs that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for over 80% of total Client revenue. The differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from year to year are affected by changes in the mix of OEM Windows operating systems licensed with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total OEM Windows operating systems licensed (“OEM premium mix”), changes in the geographic mix, and changes in the channel mix of products sold by large, multi-national OEMs versus those sold by local and regional system builders.
Client revenue increased reflecting growth in licensing of Windows Vista. Revenue from commercial and retail licensing of Windows operating systems increased $125 million or 22%. OEM revenue decreased $46 million or 1% while OEM license units increased 8%. The decline in OEM revenue reflected the four percentage point decrease in the OEM premium mix to 71% as well as changes in the geographic and product mixes. Based on our estimates, total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew 10% to 12%, driven by demand in both emerging and mature markets.
Client operating income decreased reflecting increased sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses, and cost of revenue, partially offset by increased revenue. Sales and marketing expenses increased $123 million or 43%, primarily reflecting increased advertising and marketing campaigns. Research and development expenses increased $45 million or 20% as a result of increased headcount-related expenses. Cost of revenue increased $31 million or 14%, primarily driven by product and services costs.
For the remainder of fiscal year 2009, we expect PC shipments will grow between 8% and 12%. Within the overall PC market, we expect current trends to continue.

Server and Tools concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content, and services that are designed to make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. Server and Tools offerings consist of server software licenses and client access licenses (“CAL”) for Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, and other server products. We also offer developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier and Professional product support services, and Microsoft Consulting Services. Server products can be run on-site, in a hosted environment, or in a Web-based environment. We use multiple channels for licensing, including pre-installed OEM versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. We sell licenses both as one-time licenses and as multi-year volume licenses.
Server and Tools revenue increased reflecting growth in product and services revenue and included a favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of $130 million or four percentage points. Server and server application revenue (including CAL revenue) and developer tools revenue increased $395 million or 17%, primarily driven by growth in volume licensing of Windows Server and SQL Server products. This growth reflects continued broad adoption of the Windows Platform and applications with the releases of Windows Server 2008 during the second half of fiscal year 2008 and the release of SQL Server 2008 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. Consulting and Premier and Professional product support services revenue increased $111 million or 19%, primarily due to higher demand for consulting and support services by corporate enterprises.

Table of Contents

Server and Tools operating income increased, primarily due to growth in high-margin product revenue, partially offset by increased cost of revenue, research and development expenses, and sales and marketing expenses. Cost of revenue increased $119 million or 20%, reflecting the growth in consulting and Premier and Professional product support services delivered. Research and development expenses increased $93 million or 22%, primarily driven by increased headcount-related expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $83 million or 10%, due to higher expenses associated with our corporate sales force.
For the remainder of fiscal year 2009, we expect continued growth in both product and services revenue driven by strong adoption of our product portfolio and the recognition of deferred revenue from previously signed agreements.

Online Services Business (“OSB”) consists of an on-line advertising platform with offerings for both publishers and advertisers, personal communications services such as email and instant messaging, online information offerings such as Live Search, and the MSN portals and channels around the world. We earn revenue primarily from online advertising, including search, display, and email and messaging services. Revenue is also generated through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services, from advertiser and publisher tools, digital marketing and advertising agency services, and from MSN narrowband Internet access subscribers. During the three months ended September 30, 2007, we completed our acquisition of aQuantive, Inc. (“aQuantive”), a digital marketing business. aQuantive was consolidated into our results of operations starting August 10, 2007, the acquisition date. Amounts during the three months ended September 30, 2008 included three months of aQuantive results whereas amounts during the three months ended September 30, 2007 included aQuantive results only from the acquisition date through the end of the quarter.
OSB revenue increased as a result of increased online advertising revenue and incremental aQuantive revenue, partially offset by decreased access revenue. Online advertising revenue increased $72 million or 15%, to $557 million. This increase reflected growth in our existing online advertising business. Agency revenue, which is solely derived from aQuantive, was $98 million during the three months ended September 30, 2008 and $51 million during the three months ended September 30, 2007. Access revenue decreased $20 million or 29%, to $50 million, reflecting continued migration of subscribers to broadband or other competitively-priced service providers.
OSB operating loss increased due to increased cost of revenue, sales and marketing expenses, and research and development expenses, partially offset by increased revenue. Cost of revenue increased $183 million or 47%, primarily driven by increased data center and equipment costs, online content expenses, and agency expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $54 million or 23%, and research and development expenses increased $54 million or 19%, primarily due to increased headcount-related expenses.
For the remainder of fiscal year 2009, we expect revenue to increase over the prior year as a result of investments we have made. We also expect operating expenses to increase as we continue to invest in our long-term strategy.

Microsoft Business Division (“MBD”) offerings consist of the Microsoft Office system and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions. Microsoft Office system products are designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity through a range of programs, services, and software solutions. Growth of revenue from the Microsoft Office system offerings, which generate over 90% of MBD revenue, depends on our ability to add value to the core Office product set and to continue to expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as enterprise content management, collaboration, unified communications, and business intelligence. Microsoft Dynamics products provide business solutions for financial management, customer relationship management, supply chain management, and analytics applications for small and mid-size businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. We evaluate our results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business revenue, which includes Microsoft Office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and Microsoft Dynamics revenue; and consumer revenue, which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and OEM revenue.
MBD revenue increased reflecting growth in licensing of the 2007 Microsoft Office system and included a favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of $214 million or five percentage points. Business revenue increased $544 million or 16%, primarily as a result of growth in volume licensing agreement revenue and strong transactional license sales to businesses. The increase in business revenue also included a 10% increase in Microsoft Dynamics customer billings. Consumer revenue increased $288 million or 36%, reflecting increased sales primarily due to promotional pricing programs for the 2007 Microsoft Office system.
MBD operating income increased reflecting growth in revenue, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses, cost of revenue, and research and development expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $90 million or 11%, reflecting increased expenses associated with our corporate sales force. Cost of revenue increased $64 million or 30%, driven by an increase in consulting service expenses associated with the April 2008 acquisition of Fast Search & Transfer ASA (“FAST”), and online services infrastructure costs. Research and development expenses increased $56 million or 16%, primarily driven by an increase in headcount-related expenses associated with the FAST acquisition.
For the remainder of fiscal year 2009, we expect revenue to continue to increase over the prior year as sales of the 2007 Microsoft Office system continue to grow.

and other devices. EDD leads the development efforts for our line of consumer software and hardware products including application software for Apple’s Macintosh computers and Microsoft PC hardware products, and is responsible for all retail sales and marketing for Microsoft Office and the Windows operating systems.
EDD revenue decreased primarily due to decreased Xbox platform and PC game revenue, partially offset by increases across other EDD product revenue. Xbox 360 platform and PC game revenue decreased $331 million or 22%, primarily as a result of the $330 million of incremental revenue from the launch of Halo 3 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 and decreased revenue per Xbox 360 console as a result of price reductions during the past 12 months. We shipped 2.2 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, compared with 1.8 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. Other EDD product revenue increased $216 million or 51%, led by increased sales of application software for Apple’s Macintosh computers, the Zune digital music and entertainment platform, and mobile and embedded device platforms.
EDD operating income increased primarily due to decreased cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, partially offset by increased research and development expenses and decreased revenue. Cost of revenue decreased $251 million or 21%, primarily driven by decreased Xbox 360 manufacturing costs. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $27 million or 10%, reflecting a decrease in product advertising and bad debt expenses. Research and development expenses increased $145 million or 46%, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses associated with the Windows Mobile device platform, driven by recent acquisitions.
For the remainder of fiscal year 2009, we expect revenue to be flat or to decrease relative to the prior fiscal year due to year-over-year variations in launches, volumes, mix, and prices across our portfolio of products and services. We expect sustained profitability for fiscal year 2009.

For the three months ended September 30, 2008, $179 million of losses were reported as other income (expense). For the three months ended September 30, 2007, $69 million of gains were previously recorded as a component of sales and marketing expense and have been recast as other income (expense).

Dividends and interest income decreased primarily reflecting lower interest rates on our fixed-income investments. Net recognized gains on investments, which included other-than-temporary impairments of $72 million during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 as compared with $15 million during the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, decreased primarily due to declines in debt and equity values as a result of continuing credit market stresses and stock market declines. Net losses on derivatives increased primarily due to losses on equity, commodity, and interest rate derivatives in the current period as compared to gains in the prior period. Other of $139 million in the prior year included the correction of several immaterial items from prior periods.
Effective July 1, 2008, we began presenting gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of other income (expense). Prior to July 1, 2008, we included gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of sales and marketing expense. We changed our presentation because this better reflects how we manage these foreign currency exposures and as such gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are incidental to our operations. For the three months ended September 30, 2008, $179 million of losses were reported as other income (expense). For the three months ended September 30, 2007, $69 million of gains were previously recorded as a component of sales and marketing expense and have been recast as other income (expense).
Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. We employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments, including market declines subsequent to the period-end. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, among other factors, we evaluate general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Collateral and/or security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.
We use derivative instruments to manage exposures to interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency markets and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses arising from derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are in large part economically offset by unrealized losses and gains, respectively, in the underlying securities which are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income.

Income Taxes
Our effective tax rates were 27% and 31% for the three months ended September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The fiscal year 2009 rate reflected a decline in the recurring effective tax rate primarily as a result of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates.
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, we paid the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) approximately $3.1 billion as a result of our settlement with the IRS on its 2000-2003 examination.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $20.7 billion as of September 30, 2008, compared with $23.7 billion as of June 30, 2008. Equity and other investments were $4.4 billion as of September 30, 2008, compared with $6.6 billion as of June 30, 2008. Our investments consist primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also includes foreign-denominated securities in order to diversify financial risk. We invest primarily in short-term securities to facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs. As a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $28.1 billion at September 30, 2008. Our retained deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate, pay dividends, or repay our short-term debt given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine fair value. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, U.S. treasuries, and agency securities. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and certain agency securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.
A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally labeled as Level 2 investments because the brokers price these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. Such controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.
While we own certain mortgage- and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of September 30, 2008 does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. The majority of the mortgage-backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and Government National Mortgage Association.

Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements, revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis for Windows XP and previous PC operating systems, is recorded as unearned based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately, and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product’s life cycle. Other unearned revenue includes services, Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products, Xbox Live subscriptions, advertising, Mediaroom, and other offerings for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.
The following table outlines the expected recognition of unearned revenue as of September 30, 2008:

Short-Term Debt
In September 2008, our Board of Directors authorized debt financings of up to $6.0 billion. Pursuant to the authorization, we established a commercial paper program providing for the issuance and sale of up to $2.0 billion in short-term commercial paper. As of September 30, 2008, substantially all of the commercial paper was issued and outstanding with a weighted average interest rate, including issuance cost, of 1.42%, and maturities of seven to 14 days.
In September 2008, we also entered into a $2.0 billion senior unsecured credit facility, principally to support the commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2008, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in the credit agreement, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense. The credit facility expires on March 22, 2009. No amounts were drawn against the credit facility during the three months ended September 30, 2008.
Cash Flows
Cash flow from operations decreased $2.5 billion from the first three months of fiscal year 2008 to $3.4 billion due to payment of approximately $3.1 billion to the Internal Revenue Service as a result of our settlement of the 2000-2003 audit examination. This impact was partially offset by an increase in cash received from customers, including an increase of $1.2 billion from conversion of accounts receivable to cash.
Cash used for financing was $5.2 billion in the first three months of fiscal year 2009, an increase of $2.1 billion from the corresponding period in fiscal year 2008. The increase reflected $6.5 billion of common stock repurchases in the three months ended September 30, 2008, compared with $2.9 billion in the first three months of the prior fiscal year and a $418 million decrease in proceeds from issuance of common stock. These impacts
 
29
Table of Contents

were partially offset by a $2.0 billion increase in cash proceeds from our commercial paper program established in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009.
Cash from investing was $595 million in the first three months of fiscal year 2009, as compared with cash used for investing of $2.3 billion in the first three months of fiscal year 2008, a change of $2.9 billion. This change reflected a $5.0 billion decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of companies, resulting from the purchase of aQuantive in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, partially offset by a $1.7 billion decline in cash from securities lending activities.
While we have short-term debt as described above, we currently have no long-term debt. Stockholders’ equity at September 30, 2008 was $33.6 billion. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.
On September 22, 2008, we announced the completion of the two repurchase programs approved by our Board of Directors during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 to buy back up to $40.0 billion of Microsoft common stock. On September 22, 2008, we also announced that our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases with an expiration of September 30, 2013. During the three months ended September 30, 2008, we repurchased a total of 223 million shares for $6.0 billion; 101 million shares were repurchased for $2.7 billion under the repurchase plan approved by our Board of Directors during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 and 122 million shares were repurchased for $3.3 billion under the repurchase plan approved by our Board of Directors in September 2008. As of September 30, 2008, approximately $36.7 billion remained of the $40.0 billion approved repurchase amount. All repurchases were made using cash resources. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.
Our Board of Directors declared the following dividends:

We believe existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations, should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and planned share repurchases. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by
 
30
Table of Contents

Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others – an interpretation of FASB statements No.5, 57 and 107 and rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34. We consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any material liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
On July 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (“SFAS No. 157”) for all financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. See Note 4 – Financial Instruments.
SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, became effective for us on July 1, 2008. SFAS No. 159 gives us the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for certain financial assets and liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis with the difference between the carrying value before election of the fair value option and the fair value recorded upon election as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings. We chose not to elect the fair value option.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities – an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133, which requires additional disclosures about the objectives of derivative instruments and hedging activities, the method of accounting for such instruments under SFAS No. 133 and its related interpretations, and a tabular disclosure of the effects of such instruments and related hedged items on our financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2009. We believe the adoption of SFAS No. 161 will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 to July 1, 2009 for us, for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We believe the adoption of the delayed items of SFAS No. 157 will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations, which replaces SFAS No. 141. The statement retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions, but requires a number of changes, including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized in the purchase accounting. It also changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies, requires the capitalization of in-process research and development at fair value, and requires the expensing of acquisition-related costs as incurred. SFAS No. 141R is effective for us beginning July 1, 2009 and will apply prospectively to business combinations completed on or after that date.
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements – an amendment of ARB No. 51, which changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests. Minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and will be reported as a component of
 
31
Table of Contents

equity separate from the parent’s equity, and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control will be accounted for as equity transactions. In addition, net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income and, upon a loss of control, the interest sold, as well as any interest retained, will be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in net income. SFAS No. 160 is effective for us beginning July 1, 2009 and will apply prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which will apply retrospectively. We believe the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for contingencies, accounting for income taxes, accounting for stock-based compensation, and accounting for product warranties.
We account for the licensing of software in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (“SOP”) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. The application of SOP 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value exists for those elements. For some of our products, customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. These elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. The fair value of these elements is recognized over the estimated life cycle for the Windows XP and previous PC operating systems. For Windows Vista, there are no significant undelivered elements and accordingly, no license revenue is deferred for Windows Vista sales. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.
SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5M, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (July 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units,

assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.
We account for research and development costs in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements, including SFAS No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, and SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS No. 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing.
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position, or our cash flows.
SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the requirements of FASB Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”) Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. Under FIN 48, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted.

We account for product warranties in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. We provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranty, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranty, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to foreign currency, interest rate, fixed-income, equity, and commodity price risks. A portion of these risks is hedged, but fluctuations could impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We hedge a portion of anticipated revenue and accounts receivable exposure to foreign currency fluctuations using a combination of option and synthetic forward contracts. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar. Fixed-income securities and interest rate derivatives are subject primarily to interest rate risk. The portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk. Securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio and equity derivatives are subject to price risk, and generally are not hedged. However, we use put-call collars to hedge our price risk on certain equity securities that are held primarily for strategic purposes. Commodity derivatives held for the purpose of portfolio diversification are subject to commodity price risk.
We use a value-at-risk (“VaR”) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. VaR is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. The VaR model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model used for currencies, equities, and commodities is geometric Brownian motion, which allows incorporation of optionality with regard to these risk exposures. For interest rate risk, exposures such as key rate durations and spread durations are used in calculations that reflect the principle that fixed-income security prices revert to maturity value over time.
VaR is calculated by computing the exposures of each holding’s market value to a range of over 1,000 equity, fixed-income, foreign exchange, and commodity risk factors. The exposures are then used to compute the parameters of a distribution of potential changes in the total market value of all holdings, taking into account the weighted historical volatilities of the different rates and prices and the weighted historical correlations among the different rates and prices. The VaR is then calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the VaR in 25 out of 1,000 cases. Several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, credit risk, and legal risk.
Certain securities in our equity portfolio are held for strategic purposes. We hedge the value of a portion of these securities through the use of derivative contracts such as put-call collars. In these arrangements, we hedge a security’s equity price risk below the purchased put strike and forgo most or all of the benefits of the security’s appreciation above the sold call strike. We also hold equity securities for general investment return purposes.
The VaR amounts disclosed below are used as a risk management tool and reflect an estimate of potential reductions in fair value of our portfolio. Losses in fair value over the specified holding period can exceed the reported VaR by significant amounts and can also accumulate over a longer time horizon than the specified holding period used in the VaR analysis. VaR amounts are not necessarily reflective of potential accounting losses, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
VaR numbers are shown separately for interest rate, currency rate, equity price, and commodity price risks. These VaR numbers include the underlying portfolio positions and related hedges. We use historical data to estimate VaR. Given the reliance on historical data, VaR is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. An inherent limitation in VaR is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk.

Total one-day VaR for the combined risk categories was $81 million at September 30, 2008 and $123 million at June 30, 2008. The total VaR is 43% less at September 30, 2008, and 34% less at June 30, 2008, than the sum of the separate risk categories in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the overall portfolio.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2008 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements in Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”), other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “strategy,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section titled “Risk Factors” (refer to Part II, Item 1A). We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
OVERVIEW
The following MD&A is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements (“Notes”).
We develop, manufacture, license, and support a wide range of software products for many computing devices. Our software products include operating systems for servers, PCs, and intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; information worker productivity applications; business solutions applications; and software development tools. We provide consulting and product support services, and we train and certify system integrators and developers. We sell the Xbox video game console and games, the Zune digital music and entertainment device, PC games, and PC peripherals. Online communication and information services are delivered through our MSN portals, channels around the world, and through our search products.
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Entertainment and Devices Division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, the Entertainment and Devices Division has generated over 40% of its yearly segment revenues in our second fiscal quarter. In fiscal year 2007, our revenue was highest in the third quarter due to the recognition of $1.7 billion of revenue previously deferred from the Express Upgrade to Windows Vista and Microsoft Office Technology Guarantee programs and pre-shipments of Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system. The technology guarantee programs provided customers who purchased current products with free or discounted rights to Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system when those products became available to consumers. We believe the seasonality of revenue is likely to continue in the future consistent with our experience prior to fiscal year 2007.
All growth and percentage comparisons refer to the three or nine months ended March 31, 2008, as compared with the three or nine months ended March 31, 2007, unless otherwise noted.

Proposed Acquisition of Yahoo! Inc.
On January 31, 2008, we made a proposal to the Yahoo! Inc. (“Yahoo”) board of directors to acquire all the outstanding shares of Yahoo common stock for consideration of $31 per Yahoo share, representing a total value of approximately $44.6 billion at the time of the offer. Our proposal would allow the Yahoo shareholders to elect to receive cash or 0.9509 of a share of Microsoft common stock for each of their shares of Yahoo common stock, subject to proration so that in the aggregate, one-half of the outstanding shares of Yahoo common stock would be exchanged for shares of Microsoft common stock and the other half would be exchanged for cash. On February 11, 2008, the Yahoo board of directors stated publicly that our offer undervalued the company and was not in the best interests of its shareholders. There are no assurances that any acquisition will be completed.

Revenue growth for the three months ended March 31, 2008 was driven primarily by increased Xbox platform sales, increased Windows Server and SQL Server revenue, and increased online advertising revenue, offset by decreased licensing revenue from Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system. During the three months ended March 31, 2007, we recognized approximately $1.7 billion of revenue deferred during the first half of fiscal year 2007 related to the Express Upgrade to Windows Vista and Microsoft Office Technology Guarantee programs and pre-shipments of Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system. Revenue growth for the nine months ended March 31, 2008 was driven primarily by licensing of the 2007 Microsoft Office system, increased Xbox platform sales, increased revenue associated with Windows Server and SQL Server, and increased licensing of Windows Vista. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $403 million or three percentage point increase in revenue during the three months and a $1.0 billion or three percentage point increase during the nine months ended March 31, 2008.
Operating income declined during the three months ended March 31, 2008, driven primarily by increased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies, increased headcount-related expenses, and increased cost of revenue (data center and online costs, costs associated with the growth in consulting services, and Xbox 360 product costs reflecting increased Xbox 360 console sales, partially offset by decreased Xbox 360 manufacturing costs per console). Operating income growth for the nine months ended March 31, 2008 was primarily driven by the increased revenue, partially offset by increased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies, increased cost of revenue (reflecting the items noted above and increased Windows Vista product costs), and increased headcount-related expenses. We incurred $1.5 billion of legal charges during the three months and $1.8 billion during the nine months ended March 31, 2008, primarily related to the European Commission fine of €899 million as compared with $296 million of legal charges during the three months and $494 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2007, primarily related to antitrust and unfair competition consumer class actions and intellectual property claims. Total headcount-related expenses increased 14% during the three months and 11% during the nine months ended March 31, 2008, driven by a 13% increase in headcount over the past 12 months and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount.
Worldwide macroeconomic factors have a strong correlation to business and consumer demand for our software, services, games, and Internet service offerings. We are monitoring the changing economic conditions and expect the following for fiscal year 2008: we continue to expect double-digit revenue growth; we estimate worldwide PC shipments will grow 11% to 13%; and we expect a continued favorable impact from changes in year-over-year foreign currency exchange rates.

Client offerings consist of premium edition and standard Windows operating systems. Premium offerings are those that include additional functionality and are sold at a price above our standard versions. Premium offerings include Windows XP Professional, Windows XP Media Center Edition, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, Windows Vista Business, Windows Vista Home Premium, Windows Vista Ultimate, and Windows Vista Enterprise. Standard Windows operating systems include Windows XP Home and Windows Vista Home Basic. Client revenue growth correlates with the growth of purchases of PCs from OEMs that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for approximately 80% of total Client revenue. The differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from year to year are affected by changes in the mix of OEM Windows operating systems licensed with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total OEM Windows operating systems licensed (“OEM premium mix”), changes in the geographical mix, and changes in the channel mix of products sold by large, multi-national OEMs versus those sold by local and regional system builders.
Client revenue decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2008, primarily reflecting revenue of approximately $1.2 billion recognized during the third quarter of the prior fiscal year upon the January 2007 release of Windows Vista to consumers. The amount had been deferred during the first half of fiscal year 2007 as a result of the Express Upgrade to Windows Vista Technology Guarantee program. Client revenue increased during the nine months ended March 31, 2008, primarily reflecting licensing of Windows Vista. During the three months ended March 31, 2008, OEM revenue decreased $1.1 billion or 25%, primarily reflecting revenue recognized during the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 related to the technology guarantee program, partially offset by a 5% increase in OEM license units. During the nine months ended March 31, 2008, OEM revenue increased $1.3 billion or 14%, driven by 14% growth in OEM license units. Revenue from commercial and retail licensing of Windows operating systems decreased $146 million or 18% during the three months ended March 31, 2008, primarily reflecting revenue recognized during the third quarter of the prior year related to the January 2007 consumer launch of Windows Vista. Revenue from commercial and retail licensing of Windows operating systems increased $71 million or 4% during the nine months ended March 31, 2008, primarily due to sales from Enterprise Agreements and anti-piracy efforts in emerging markets. The OEM premium mix increased five percentage points to 76% compared with the third quarter of last year and nine percentage points to 75% compared with the first nine months of last year, driven by increased consumer premium mix. Based on our estimates, total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew 8% to 10% from the third quarter of the previous year and 12% to 14% from the first nine months of the previous year driven by demand in both emerging and mature markets.

Client operating income decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2008, reflecting the decreased revenue, partially offset by decreased sales and marketing expenses and decreased cost of revenue. Client operating income increased during the nine months ended March 31, 2008, reflecting the increased revenue, partially offset by increased cost of revenue. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $111 million or 21% during the three months, driven by decreased global advertising. Cost of revenue decreased $31 million or 11% during the three months, reflecting higher support services related to commercial and retail licensing during the third quarter of the prior fiscal year for the Windows Vista launch, and increased $162 million or 30% during the nine months, driven by Windows Vista product costs. Headcount-related expenses decreased 7% during the three months and were flat during the nine months ended March 31, 2008, driven by a 2% decrease in headcount over the past 12 months and decreased stock-based compensation expense.
For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, we expect PC market growth will exceed OEM revenue growth. We expect PC shipments to grow 11% to 13% for fiscal year 2008. We believe that PC unit growth rates will be higher in the consumer segment than in the business segment and higher in emerging markets than in mature markets.

Server and Tools offerings consist of server software licenses and client access licenses (“CAL”) for Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, and other server products. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier and Professional product support services, and Microsoft Consulting Services. Server and Tools concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content, and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. We use multiple channels for licensing, including pre-installed OEM versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. We sell licenses both as one-time licenses, and as multi-year volume licenses.
Server and Tools revenue increased during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2008, reflecting growth in both product and services revenue. Server and server application revenue (including CAL revenue) and developer tools, training, and certificate revenue increased $381 million or 17% during the three months and $932 million or 14% during the nine months ended March 31, 2008, primarily driven by growth in new and recurring volume licensing of Windows Server and SQL Server products, reflecting broad adoption of the Windows Platform and applications. Consulting and Premier and Professional product support services revenue increased $126 million or 24% during the three months and $414 million or 28% during the nine months ended March 31, 2008, primarily due to higher demand for consulting and support services in corporate enterprises. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $120 million or four percentage point increase in revenue for the three months and $296 million or four percentage point increase in revenue for the nine months ended March 31, 2008.
Server and Tools operating income increased for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2008, primarily reflecting the increased revenue, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses, cost of revenue for services, and research and development expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $165 million or 20% during the three months and $397 million or 16% during the nine months ended March 31, 2008, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses associated with our corporate sales force. Cost of revenue increased $92 million or 17% during the three months and $261 million or 16% during the nine months ended March 31, 2008, reflecting the growth in services provided. Research and development expenses increased $71 million or 17% during the three months and $136 million or 11% during the nine months ended March 31, 2008, primarily driven by increased headcount-related expenses. Headcount-related expenses increased 8%

Online Services Business (“OSB”) provides personal communications services, such as e-mail and instant messaging, online information offerings, such as Live Search, and the MSN portals and channels around the world. OSB also provides a variety of online services such as MSN Internet Access and MSN Premium Web Services. We earn revenue primarily from online advertising, including search, home page, email, and messaging services, from consumers and partners through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services, and from MSN narrowband Internet Access subscribers. We continue to launch new online initiatives and expect to do so in the future. During fiscal year 2008, we launched a new release of Windows Live Search and the Windows Live suite of applications and services.
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, we completed our acquisition of aQuantive, Inc. (“aQuantive”), a digital marketing business which we expect will play a key role in the future development of our advertising business. aQuantive earns revenue from online advertising and from digital marketing and advertising agency services. We believe the acquisition will help us build and support next-generation advertiser and publisher solutions in environments such as cross-media planning, video-on-demand, and Internet protocol television. aQuantive was consolidated into our results of operations starting August 10, 2007, the acquisition date.
OSB revenue increased during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2008, driven primarily by increased online advertising revenue and the inclusion of aQuantive revenue, partially offset by decreased access revenue. Online advertising revenue increased $175 million or 39% to $619 million during the three months and $460 million or 36% to $1.7 billion during the nine months ended March 31, 2008. This increase reflects growth in our existing online advertising business and includes aQuantive online advertising revenue of $47 million during the three months and $128 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2008. Agency revenue, which is solely derived from aQuantive, was $97 million during the three months and $251 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2008. Access revenue was $60 million for the three months and $197 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2008, reflecting decreases of 29% for both periods. As of March 31, 2008, we had 448 million Windows Live IDs compared with 380 million as of the same period last year.
OSB operating loss increased during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2008, driven primarily by increased cost of revenue and increased sales and marketing expenses, partially offset by increased revenue. Cost of revenue increased $176 million or 61% during the three months and $545 million or 68% during the nine months ended March 31, 2008, primarily driven by increased data center costs, online content expenses, and aQuantive-related expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $69 million or 33% during the three months and $231 million or 39% during the nine months ended March 31, 2008, primarily due to increased marketing costs and amortization of customer-related intangible assets. OSB operating loss for the three months ended March 31, 2008 included $46 million of amortization of intangible assets acquired from aQuantive, and OSB operating loss for the nine months ended March 31, 2008 included $122 million of intangible assets amortization

and a $24 million in-process research and development write-off. Headcount-related expenses increased 27% during the three months and 19% during the nine months ended March 31, 2008, driven by a 26% increase in headcount over the past 12 months and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by decreased stock-based compensation expense.
For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, online advertising revenue is expected to benefit from our acquisition of aQuantive, while revenue from narrowband Internet Access is expected to continue to decline. We also expect operating expenses to increase as we continue to invest in our long-term strategy. We believe these investments will lay the groundwork for future growth.

Microsoft Business Division (“MBD”) offerings consist of the Microsoft Office system and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions. Microsoft Office system products are designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity through a range of programs, services, and software solutions. Growth of revenue from the Microsoft Office system offerings, which generate over 90% of MBD revenue, depends on our ability to add value to the core Office product set and to continue to expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as enterprise content management, collaboration, unified communications, and business intelligence. Microsoft Dynamics products provide business solutions for financial management, customer relationship management, supply chain management, and analytics applications for small and mid-size businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. We evaluate our results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business revenue, which includes Microsoft Office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and Microsoft Dynamics revenue and consumer revenue, which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and OEM revenue.
MBD revenue decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2008, primarily reflecting revenue of approximately $500 million recognized during the third quarter of the prior fiscal year upon the January 2007 release of the 2007 Microsoft Office system to consumers. The amount had been deferred during the first half of fiscal year 2007, as a result of the Microsoft Office Technology Guarantee program. MBD revenue increased during the nine months ended March 31, 2008, primarily reflecting licensing of the 2007 Microsoft Office system. Business revenue increased $555 million or 17% during the three months and $1.9 billion or 21% during the nine months ended March 31, 2008, primarily as a result of growth in volume licensing agreement revenue and strong transactional license sales to businesses. The increase in business revenue also included a 13% increase in Microsoft Dynamics customer billings during the three months and a 20% increase during the nine months ended March 31, 2008. Consumer revenue decreased $636 million or 39% primarily reflecting revenue of approximately $500 million recognized during the third quarter related to the 2007 Microsoft Office Technology Guarantee program and remained flat during the nine months ended March 31, 2008, primarily reflecting the consumer launch of the 2007 Microsoft Office system in the prior fiscal year. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $194 million or four percentage point increase in revenue during the three months and a $458 million or four percentage point increase in revenue during the nine months ended March 31, 2008.
MBD operating income decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2008, reflecting the decreased revenue, increased sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses, and cost of revenue. MBD operating income increased for the nine months ended March 31, 2008, reflecting the increased revenue, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses, cost of revenue, and research and development expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $72 million or 8% during the three months and $386 million or 16% during

the nine months ended March 31, 2008, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses associated with our corporate sales force. Research and development expenses increased $58 million or 19% during the three months and $132 million or 14% during the nine months ended March 31, 2008, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses. Cost of revenue increased $41 million or 20% during the three months and $138 million or 25% during the nine months ended March 31, 2008, primarily driven by an increase in online costs reflecting the April 2007 acquisition of Tellme Networks. Headcount-related expenses increased 16% during the three months and 9% during the nine months ended March 31, 2008, driven by a 7% increase in headcount over the past 12 months and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by decreased stock-based compensation expense during the nine month period.
For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, we expect revenue to continue to increase over the prior year due to the strong performance of the 2007 Microsoft Office system. We continue to develop plans to grow revenue in new areas such as unified communications and through our existing portfolio of Microsoft Dynamics products. In April 2008, we acquired Fast Search & Transfer ASA, an enterprise search company, for approximately $1.2 billion in cash. We believe the acquisition will broaden our enterprise search technology product offerings to businesses and will enable innovations in related areas such as our portal and content management.

The Entertainment and Devices Division (“EDD”) products include the Xbox 360 platform (which includes the Microsoft Xbox video game console system, Xbox 360 video games, Xbox Live, and Xbox 360 accessories), PC games, consumer software and hardware products, the Zune digital music and entertainment platform, Mediaroom (our Internet protocol television software), the Windows Mobile software platform, the Windows Embedded device operating system, and Windows Automotive. The success of video game consoles is determined by console innovation and quality, the portfolio of video game content for the console, online offerings, and the market share of the console. We believe that the functionality of the Xbox 360 console, games portfolio, and online offerings are well positioned relative to competitive consoles.
EDD revenue increased during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2008, primarily due to increased Xbox 360 platform sales. During the three months ended March 31, 2008, Xbox platform and PC game revenue increased $418 million or 85% primarily as a result of increased Xbox 360 console sales, Xbox 360 video game sales, and Xbox Live revenue. Xbox platform and PC game revenue increased $1.4 billion or 42% during the nine months ended March 31, 2008, as a result of increased Xbox 360 console sales, video game sales led by Halo 3, Xbox Live revenue, and Xbox 360 accessory sales. We shipped 1.3 million Xbox 360 consoles in the third quarter and 7.5 million Xbox 360 consoles in the first nine months of fiscal year 2008, compared with 0.5 million and 5.9 million Xbox 360 consoles in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2007, respectively.
EDD operating income increased during the three months ended March 31, 2008, primarily due to the increased revenue, partially offset by increased cost of revenue, research and development expenses, and sales and marketing expenses. EDD operating income increased during the nine months ended March 31, 2008, primarily due to the increased revenue, partially offset by increased cost of revenue and research and development expenses. Cost of revenue increased $79 million or 11% during the three months and $143 million

or 4% during the nine months ended March 31, 2008, primarily driven by increased Xbox 360 product costs reflecting increased Xbox 360 console sales, partially offset by decreased Xbox 360 manufacturing costs per console. Research and development expenses increased $77 million or 26% during the three months and $101 million or 11% during the nine months ended March 31, 2008, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $62 million or 29% during the three months ended March 31, 2008, reflecting an increase in headcount-related expenses associated with product marketing and retail account sales force. Headcount-related expenses increased 35% and 20% during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2008, respectively, reflecting a 13% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by decreased stock-based compensation expense during the nine month period.
For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, we expect revenue to increase due to increased sales of Xbox 360 consoles and related games, accessories, and services. Revenue from existing mobility and embedded devices is expected to increase due to unit volume increases of Windows Mobile software driven by increased market demand for phone-enabled devices and Windows Embedded operating systems. In April 2008, we acquired Danger, Inc., a software-as-a-service company that provides mobile operators with an integrated end-to-end solution to deliver mobile data and Internet services to their subscribers, for approximately $500 million in cash.

Corporate-level expenses increased for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2008, primarily reflecting increased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies and increased headcount-related expenses. We incurred $1.5 billion of legal charges during the three months and $1.8 billion during the nine months ended March 31, 2008, primarily related to the European Commission fine of €899 million as compared with $296 million of legal charges during the three months and $494 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2007, primarily related to antitrust and unfair competition consumer class actions and intellectual property claims. Headcount-related expenses increased 14% during the three months and 13% during the nine months ended March 31, 2008, driven by a 6% increase in headcount over the past 12 months, an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, and an increase in stock-based compensation.

Cost of revenue increased during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2008, reflecting increased OSB data center and online costs, increased costs associated with the growth in consulting services, and increased Xbox 360 product costs, reflecting increased Xbox 360 console sales, partially offset by decreased Xbox 360 manufacturing costs per console. The increase in cost of revenue during the nine months ended March 31, 2008, also reflects increased Windows Vista product costs. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was lower in the prior year reflecting an increased percentage of higher margin sales as a result of the recognition of approximately $1.7 billion of revenue deferred during the first half of fiscal year 2007 related to the Express Upgrade to Windows Vista and Microsoft Office Technology Guarantee programs.

During the three and nine months ended March 31, 2008, dividends and interest income decreased, reflecting lower interest rates on our fixed-income investments and a reduction in the average balance of interest-bearing investments. Net recognized gains/(losses) on investments, which includes other-than-temporary impairments of $179 million for the three months and $248 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2008, decreased primarily due to declines in equity values as a result of the recent stock market decline.
During the three and nine months ended March 31, 2008, net gains on derivatives increased primarily due to higher net gains on equity, interest rate, and commodity derivatives. We use derivative instruments to manage exposures to interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency markets and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses arising from derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are in large part economically offset by unrealized losses and gains, respectively, in the underlying securities, which are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Net losses related to foreign currency contracts relate primarily to changes in time value of options used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues. Other of $133 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2008 includes the correction of several immaterial items from prior periods.

We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Collateral and/or security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.
Income Taxes
The effective tax rate was 9% and 25%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2008. The fiscal year 2008 rates reflect a decline in the recurring effective tax rate from 31% to 30%, primarily as a result of resolution of tax positions relating to our agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) of the 2000-2003 examination. The effective tax rate also declined as a result of the reduction in previously accrued taxes and interest related to the 2000-2003 IRS examination. This decline was partially offset by the tax effect of the European Commission fine of €899 million, which is not tax deductible.
The effective tax rate was 29% and 30%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2007. These rates reflect an increase in the recurring effective tax rate from 31% to 31.5% due to a higher mix of earnings in high rate tax jurisdictions and were offset by a $195 million reduction resulting from various changes in tax positions taken in prior periods, related primarily to favorable developments in an IRS position and multiple foreign audit assessments.
On July 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”) Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which provides a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Under FIN 48, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures.
Adopting FIN 48 had the following impact on our financial statements: increased current assets by $228 million, long-term assets by $1.1 billion, long-term liabilities by $2.1 billion, and our retained deficit by $395 million; and decreased our income taxes payable by $394 million. As of July 1, 2007, we had $7.1 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $5.3 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. As of July 1, 2007, we had accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions of $863 million, net of federal income tax benefit, on our balance sheet.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $26.3 billion as of March 31, 2008, compared with $23.4 billion as of June 30, 2007. Equity and other investments were $8.7 billion as of March 31, 2008, compared with $10.1 billion as of June 30, 2007. Our investments consist primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S.-dollar-denominated securities, but also includes foreign-denominated securities in order to diversify financial risk. We invest primarily in short-term securities to facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs. As a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $25.8 billion at March 31, 2008. Our retained deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate or pay dividends given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to price positions. This pricing methodology applies to exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international

Table of Contents

equities, U.S. treasuries, and Agency securities. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to price positions are not available, then we use inputs other than the quoted prices which are observable either directly or indirectly, predominately based on prices received from third-party vendors. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.
While we own certain mortgage and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of March 31, 2008, does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from sub-prime collateral. The majority of the mortgage-backed securities is collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carries a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and Government National Mortgage Association. The remainder of the mortgage position is collateralized by high quality international prime residential mortgage loans.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements, revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis for Windows XP and previous PC operating systems, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the life cycle of the related product. Other unearned revenue includes services, Microsoft Dynamics business solution products, Xbox Live subscriptions, advertising, and Mediaroom for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.
The following table outlines the expected recognition of unearned revenue as of March 31, 2008:

Cash Flows
Cash flow from operations for the nine months ended March 31, 2008 increased $4.1 billion from the first nine months of fiscal year 2007 to $17.5 billion due to an increase in cash received from customers, including an increase in accounts receivable collections of $1.1 billion. The increase also reflects a reduction in cash used for repayment of other current liabilities of $949 million. Cash used for financing was $7.9 billion in the first nine months of fiscal year 2008, a decrease of $9.7 billion from the corresponding period in fiscal year 2007. The decrease reflects $8.2 billion of common stock repurchases in the nine months ended March 31, 2008, compared with $20.4 billion in the first nine months of the prior fiscal year, which included the impact of our tender offer on August 17, 2006. This impact was partially offset by a $2.4 billion decrease in proceeds from issuance of common stock, reflecting the JPMorgan exercise of approximately 113 million call options for $3.3 billion in December 2006. Cash used for investing was $4.1 billion in the first nine months of fiscal year 2008, as compared with cash provided from investing of $5.0 billion in the first nine months of fiscal year 2007, a change of $9.1 billion. This change reflects a $5.5 billion increase in cash paid for acquisition of companies, reflecting

the purchase of aQuantive in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, along with a $2.9 billion decrease in cash from combined investment purchases, sales, and maturities.
As previously mentioned, on January 31, 2008, we submitted to the board of directors of Yahoo a proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Yahoo common stock, and on February 11, 2008, the Yahoo board of directors stated publicly that our offer undervalued the company and was not in the best interests of its shareholders. We currently are reviewing various alternatives to finance the cash portion of the proposed acquisition if we are successful in acquiring all of the outstanding shares. There are no assurances that any acquisition will be completed.
In April 2008, we acquired Fast Search & Transfer ASA for approximately $1.2 billion and Danger, Inc. for approximately $500 million in cash. As a result of our agreement with the IRS related to the 2000-2003 examination, we expect to pay them approximately $3.0 billion during the next year. As previously noted, we were fined €899 million by the European Commission in February 2008 (see Note 8 – Contingencies of Part I, Item 1). During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, we expect to either pay the fine or, if we appeal, we may deliver a bank guarantee as an assurance the fine will be paid if an appeal is unsuccessful.
We currently have no material long-term debt. Stockholders’ equity at March 31, 2008 was $37.6 billion. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources.
On July 20, 2006, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized two new share repurchase programs: a $20.0 billion tender offer that was completed on August 17, 2006 and authorization for up to an additional $20.0 billion ongoing share repurchase program with an expiration of June 30, 2011. Under the tender offer, we repurchased approximately 155 million shares of common stock, or 1.5% of our common shares outstanding, for approximately $3.8 billion at a price per share of $24.75. On August 18, 2006, we announced that the authorization for the $20.0 billion ongoing share repurchase program had been increased by approximately $16.2 billion. As a result, we are authorized to repurchase additional shares in an amount up to $36.2 billion through June 30, 2011. As of March 31, 2008, approximately $7.7 billion remained of the $36.2 billion approved repurchase amount.
Our Board of Directors declared the following dividends:

We believe existing cash and equivalents and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations, should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, regular quarterly dividends, and planned share repurchases. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short-term investments, as well as equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels,

investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. We consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any material liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
On July 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which provides a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Under FIN 48, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Upon adoption, we recognized a $395 million charge to our beginning retained deficit as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. See Note 13 – Income Taxes.
On July 1, 2007, we adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 06-2 (“EITF 06-2”), Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43. EITF 06-2 requires companies to accrue the costs of compensated absences under a sabbatical or similar benefit arrangement over the requisite service period. Upon adoption, we recognized a $17 million charge to our beginning retained deficit as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133, which requires additional disclosures about the objectives of the derivative instruments and hedging activities, the method of accounting for such instruments under SFAS No. 133 and its related interpretations, and a tabular disclosure of the effects of such instruments and related hedged items on our financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2009. We are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of SFAS No. 161 may have on our financial statements.
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations, which replaces SFAS No. 141. The statement retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions, but requires a number of changes, including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized in the purchase accounting. It also changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies, requires the capitalization of in-process research and development at fair value, and requires the expensing of acquisition-related costs as incurred. SFAS No. 141R is effective for us beginning July 1, 2009 and will apply prospectively to business combinations completed on or after that date.

Table of Contents

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51, which changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests. Minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and will be reported as a component of equity separate from the parent’s equity, and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control will be accounted for as equity transactions. In addition, net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement and, upon a loss of control, the interest sold, as well as any interest retained, will be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings. SFAS No. 160 is effective for us beginning July 1, 2009 and will apply prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which will apply retrospectively. We are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of SFAS No. 160 may have on our financial statements.
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 gives us the irrevocable option to carry many financial assets and liabilities at fair values, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for us beginning July 1, 2008. We are currently assessing the potential impact that electing fair value measurement may have on our financial statements and have not determined what election we will make.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). SFAS No. 157 is effective for us beginning July 1, 2008; FSP 157-2 delays the effective date for certain items to July 1, 2009. We are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of this statement may have on our financial statements.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for contingencies, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for stock-based compensation.
We account for the licensing of software in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (“SOP”) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. The application of SOP 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value exists for those elements. For some of our products, customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. These elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. The fair value of these elements is recognized over the estimated life cycle for the Windows XP and previous PC operating systems. For Windows Vista, there are no significant undelivered elements and accordingly, no license revenue is deferred for Windows Vista sales. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment also is required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.
SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and SAB Topic 5M, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment
 
32
Table of Contents

is other-than-temporarily impaired. Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (July 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.
We account for research and development costs in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements, including SFAS No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, and SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS No. 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. This is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. We determined that technological feasibility was reached with Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system during the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 and accordingly, we capitalized approximately $120 million of software development costs. The amortization of these costs will be included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. Previously, costs incurred prior to technological feasibility were not material and were expensed as incurred.
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position, or our cash flows.
SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes
 
33
Table of Contents

payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the requirements of FIN 48.
We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted.
We account for product warranties in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. We provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranty, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business, but generally include technical support, parts, and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranty, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We reevaluate our estimates at least quarterly to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements in Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”), other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “strategy,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section titled “Risk Factors” (refer to Part II, Item 1A). We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
OVERVIEW
The following MD&A is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements (“Notes”).
We develop, manufacture, license, and support a wide range of software products for many computing devices. Our software products include operating systems for servers, PCs, and intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; information worker productivity applications; business solutions applications; and software development tools. We provide consulting and product support services, and we train and certify system integrators and developers. We sell the Xbox video game console and games, the Zune digital music and entertainment device, PC games, and PC peripherals. Online communication and information services are delivered through our MSN portals, channels around the world, and through our search products.
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Entertainment and Devices Division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, the Entertainment and Devices Division has generated over 40% of its yearly segment revenues in our second fiscal quarter. In fiscal year 2007, our revenue was highest in the third quarter due to the recognition of $1.7 billion of revenue previously deferred from the Express Upgrade to Windows Vista and Microsoft Office Technology Guarantee programs and pre-shipments of Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system. The technology guarantee programs provided customers who purchased current products with free or discounted rights to Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system when those products became available to consumers. We believe the seasonality of revenue is likely to continue in the future consistent with our experience prior to fiscal year 2007.
All growth and percentage comparisons refer to the three or six months ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the three or six months ended December 31, 2006, unless otherwise noted.

For the three and six months ended December 31, 2007, revenue growth was impacted by the deferral of revenue during the first half of fiscal year 2007 from the Express Upgrade to Windows Vista and Microsoft Office Technology Guarantee programs and pre-shipments of Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system. Revenue growth for the three months ended December 31, 2007 was driven primarily by licensing of Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system, which were made available to consumers in January 2007, and increased revenue associated with Windows Server and SQL Server. Revenue growth for the six months ended December 31, 2007 was driven primarily by licensing of Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system, increased Xbox console and game sales, and increased revenue associated with Windows Server and SQL Server. Revenue from licensing of Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system reflects growth in our OEM channel and growth from volume licensing. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $410 million or three percentage point increase in revenue during the three months and a $615 million or three percentage point increase during the six months ended December 31, 2007.
Operating income growth for the three months ended December 31, 2007 was driven primarily by the increased revenue, partially offset by increased headcount-related expenses, increased sales and marketing expenses, and increased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. During the quarter, we incurred $237 million in legal charges as compared with $111 million in legal charges during the three months ended December 31, 2006. Operating income growth for the six months ended December 31, 2007 was driven primarily by the increased revenue, partially offset by increased cost of revenue, increased headcount-related expenses, and increased sales and marketing expenses. Total headcount-related expenses increased 13% during the three months and 10% during the six months ended December 31, 2007, driven by a 12% increase in headcount over the past twelve months and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by decreased stock-based compensation expense.
Worldwide macroeconomic factors have a strong correlation to business and consumer demand for our software, services, games, and Internet service offerings. While we are monitoring the changing economic conditions, we continue to expect double-digit revenue growth. We estimate worldwide PC shipments will grow 11% to 13%. We expect a continued favorable impact from changes in year-over-year foreign currency exchange rates in fiscal year 2008. We expect our operating income growth rate to continue to exceed our revenue growth rate in fiscal year 2008.
SEGMENT PRODUCT REVENUE/OPERATING INCOME/(LOSS)
Revenue and operating income/(loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with U.S. GAAP and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. Segment information appearing in Note 9 – Segment Information is presented on a basis consistent with our current internal management reporting, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Certain corporate-level activity has been excluded from segment operating results and is analyzed separately. Prior period amounts have been recast to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor performance at the segment level in fiscal year 2008.

Client offerings consist of premium edition and standard Windows operating systems. Premium offerings are those that include additional functionality and are sold at a price above our standard versions. Premium offerings include Windows XP Professional, XP Media Center Edition, XP Tablet PC Edition, Vista Business, Vista Home Premium, Vista Ultimate, and Vista Enterprise. Standard Windows operating systems include Windows XP Home and Windows Vista Home Basic. Client revenue growth correlates with the growth of purchases of PCs from OEMs that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for approximately 80% of total Client revenue. The differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from year to year are affected by changes in the mix of OEM Windows operating systems licensed with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total OEM Windows operating systems licensed (“OEM premium mix”), changes in the geographical mix, and changes in the channel mix of products sold by large, multi-national OEMs versus those sold by local and regional system builders.
Client revenue increased during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007, primarily reflecting licensing of Windows Vista. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2007, we deferred approximately $1.1 billion of revenue and during the first half of fiscal year 2007, we deferred approximately $1.2 billion of revenue pending the January 2007 release of Windows Vista to consumers. During the three months ended December 31, 2007, OEM revenue increased $1.7 billion or 80% driven by 18% growth in OEM license units. During the six months ended December 31, 2007, OEM revenue increased $2.4 billion or 48%, driven by 19% growth in OEM license units. Revenue from commercial and retail licensing of Windows operating systems increased $92 million or 18% during the three months and $218 million or 21% during the six months ended December 31, 2007, primarily due to strong sales from Enterprise Agreements and anti-piracy efforts in Russia, China, and other emerging markets. The OEM premium mix increased eight percentage points to 75% compared with the second quarter of last year and 12 percentage points to 75% compared to the first half of last year, driven by increased consumer premium mix. Based on our estimates, total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew 14% to 16% from the second quarter of the previous year and 13% to 15% from the first half of the previous year driven by demand in both emerging and mature markets.
Client operating income increased during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007, reflecting the increased revenue, partially offset by increased cost of revenue and increased sales and marketing expenses. Cost of revenue increased $89 million or 54% during the three months and $193 million or 70% during the six months ended December 31, 2007, driven by Windows Vista product costs. Sales and marketing expenses increased $78 million or 22% during the three months and $157 million or 27% during the six months ended December 31, 2007, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses associated with our corporate sales force. Headcount-related expenses increased 38% during the three months and 4% during the six months ended December 31, 2007.
For the remainder of fiscal year 2008, we expect continued strength in OEM revenue growth, in line with strength in the PC market. We expect PC shipments to grow 11% to 13% for fiscal year 2008. We believe that PC unit growth rates will be higher in the consumer segment than in the business segment and higher in emerging markets than in mature markets.

Server and Tools offerings consist of server software licenses and client access licenses (“CAL”) for Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, and other server products. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier and Professional product support services, and Microsoft Consulting Services. Server and Tools concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content, and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. We use multiple channels for licensing, including pre-installed OEM versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. We sell licenses both as one-time licenses and as multi-year volume licenses.
Server and Tools revenue increased during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007, reflecting growth in both product and services revenue. Server and server application revenue (including CAL revenue) and developer tools, training, and certificate revenue increased $289 million or 12% during the three months and $551 million or 13% during the six months ended December 31, 2007, primarily driven by growth in new and recurring volume licensing of Windows Server and SQL Server products and reflects broad adoption of the Windows Platform and applications. Consulting, Premier and Professional product support services revenue increased $146 million or 28% during the three months and $288 million or 30% during the six months ended December 31, 2007, primarily due to higher demand for consulting and support services in corporate enterprises. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $111 million or four percentage point increase in revenue for the three months and $177 million or four percentage point increase in revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2007.
Server and Tools operating income increased for the three and six months ended December 31, 2007, primarily reflecting the increased revenue, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses and cost of revenue for services. Sales and marketing expenses increased $102 million or 12% during the three months and $235 million or 15% during the six months ended December 31, 2007, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses associated with our corporate sales force. Cost of revenue increased $93 million or 18% during the three months and $169 million or 16% during the six months ended December 31, 2007, reflecting the growth in services provided. Headcount-related expenses increased 9% during the three months and 6% during the six months ended December 31, 2007, driven by an 11% increase in headcount over the past twelve months and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by decreased stock-based compensation expense.
For the remainder of fiscal year 2008, we expect continued growth in both product and services revenue. We expect product revenue growth from platform adoption through new and renewal volume licensing growth coupled with our new product offerings.

Online Services Business (“OSB”) provides personal communications services, such as e-mail and instant messaging, online information offerings, such as Live Search, and the MSN portals and channels around the

world. OSB also provides a variety of online services such as MSN Internet Access and MSN Premium Web Services. We earn revenue primarily from online advertising, including search, home page, email, and messaging services, from consumers and partners through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services, and from MSN narrowband Internet access subscribers. We continue to launch new online initiatives and expect to do so in the future. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, we launched a new release of Windows Live Search, and during the second quarter of fiscal year 2008, we launched the Windows Live suite of applications and services.
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, we completed our acquisition of aQuantive, Inc. (“aQuantive”), a digital marketing business which we expect will play a key role in the future development of our advertising business. aQuantive earns revenue from online advertising and from digital marketing and advertising agency services. We believe the acquisition will help us build and support next-generation advertiser and publisher solutions in environments such as cross-media planning, video-on-demand, and internet protocol television. aQuantive was consolidated into our results of operations starting August 10, 2007, the acquisition date.
OSB revenue increased during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 driven primarily by increased online advertising revenue and the inclusion of aQuantive revenue, partially offset by decreased access revenue. Online advertising revenue increased $170 million or 38% to $623 million during the three months and $286 million or 35% to $1.1 billion during the six months ended December 31, 2007. This increase reflects growth in our existing online advertising business and includes aQuantive online advertising revenue of $52 million during the three months and $81 million during the six months ended December 31, 2007. Agency revenue, which is solely derived from aQuantive, was $102 million during the three months and $153 million during the six months ended December 31, 2007. Access revenue was $67 million for the three months and $137 million for the six months ended December 31, 2007, reflecting decreases of 26% and 29%, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately 427 million Windows Live IDs compared with 352 million as of the same period last year.
OSB operating loss increased during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 driven primarily by increased cost of revenue and increased sales and marketing expenses, partially offset by the increased revenue. OSB operating loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 included $46 million of amortization of intangible assets acquired from aQuantive, and OSB operating loss for the six months ended December 31, 2007 includes $76 million of intangible assets amortization and a $24 million in-process research and development write-off. Cost of revenue increased $218 million or 82% during the three months and $369 million or 73% during the six months ended December 31, 2007 primarily driven by increased data center costs, online content expenses, and aQuantive-related expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $92 million or 43% during the three months and $161 million or 43% during the six months ended December 31, 2007, primarily due to increased marketing costs and amortization of customer-related intangible assets. Headcount-related expenses increased 23% during the three months and 15% during the six months ended December 31, 2007, driven by a 22% increase in headcount over the past twelve months and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount.
For the remainder of fiscal year 2008, we expect continued growth in online advertising revenue as the portals, channels, and communications services continue to expand globally and the overall Internet advertising market continues to expand. Online advertising revenue is expected to benefit from our acquisition of aQuantive while revenue from narrowband Internet Access is expected to continue to decline. For the remainder of fiscal year 2008, we expect operating expenses to increase as we continue to invest in our long-term strategy. We believe these investments will lay the groundwork for future growth.

Microsoft Business Division (“MBD”) offerings consist of the Microsoft Office system and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions. Microsoft Office system products are designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity through a range of programs, services, and software solutions. Growth of revenue from the Microsoft Office system offerings, which generate over 90% of MBD revenue, depends on our ability to add value to the core Office product set and to continue to expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as enterprise content management, collaboration, unified communications, and business intelligence. Microsoft Dynamics products provide business solutions for financial management, customer relationship management, supply chain management, and analytics applications for small and mid-size businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. We evaluate our results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business revenue which includes Microsoft Office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and Microsoft Dynamics revenue and consumer revenue, which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and OEM revenue.
MBD revenue increased during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007, primarily reflecting licensing of the 2007 Microsoft Office system and the fiscal year 2007 second quarter revenue deferral of approximately $500 million as a result of the Microsoft Office Technology Guarantee program. Business revenue increased $706 million or 23% during the three months and $1.4 billion or 24% during the six months ended December 31, 2007, primarily as a result of growth in volume licensing agreement revenue and strong transactional license sales to businesses. The increase in business revenue also included a 26% increase in Microsoft Dynamics customer billings during the three months and a 24% increase during the six months ended December 31, 2007. Consumer revenue increased $592 million or 153% during the three months and $620 million or 53% during the six months ended December 31, 2007, primarily reflecting the technology guarantee deferral of approximately $500 million discussed above. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $170 million or five percentage point increase in revenue during the three months and a $263 million or four percentage point increase in revenue during the six months ended December 31, 2007.
MBD operating income increased for the three and six months ended December 31, 2007, reflecting the increased revenue, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses, cost of revenue, and research and development expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $159 million or 19% during the three months and $312 million or 20% during the six months ended December 31, 2007, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses associated with our corporate sales force. Cost of revenue increased $47 million or 26% during the three months and $97 million or 28% during the six months ended December 31, 2007, primarily driven by an increase in online costs reflecting the April 2007 acquisition of Tellme Networks. Research and development expenses increased $52 million or 17% during the three months and $74 million or 12% during the six months ended December 31, 2007, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses. Headcount-related expenses increased 9% during the three months and 4% during the six months ended December 31, 2007, driven by a 6% increase in headcount over the past twelve months and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by decreased stock-based compensation expense.
For the remainder of fiscal year 2008, we expect revenue to continue to increase over the prior year due to the strong performance of the 2007 Microsoft Office system. We continue to develop plans to grow revenue in new areas such as unified communications and through our existing portfolio of Microsoft Dynamics products.

The Entertainment and Devices Division (“EDD”) products include the Xbox 360 platform (which includes the Microsoft Xbox video game console system, Xbox 360 video games, Xbox Live, and Xbox 360 accessories), PC games, consumer software and hardware products, the Zune digital music and entertainment platform, Mediaroom (our internet protocol television software), the Windows Mobile software platform, the Windows Embedded device operating system, and Windows Automotive. The success of video game consoles is determined by console innovation and quality, the portfolio of video game content for the console, online offerings, and the market share of the console. We believe that the functionality of the Xbox 360 console, games portfolio, and online offerings are well positioned relative to competitive consoles.
EDD revenue increased during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007, primarily due to increased Xbox 360 platform sales. During the three months ended December 31, 2007, Xbox platform and PC game revenue increased $115 million or 5% primarily as a result of increased Xbox 360 video game sales, Xbox Live revenue, and Xbox 360 accessory sales, partially offset by decreased Xbox 360 console sales. Xbox platform and PC game revenue increased $1.0 billion or 35% during the six months ended December 31, 2007, as a result of increased Xbox 360 console sales, video game sales led by Halo 3, Xbox Live revenues, and Xbox 360 accessory sales. We shipped 4.3 million and 6.1 million Xbox 360 consoles in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2008, respectively, as compared to 4.4 million and 5.4 million Xbox 360 consoles in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2007, respectively.
EDD operating income increased during the three months ended December 31, 2007, primarily due to the increased revenue, decreased cost of revenue, and decreased sales and marketing expenses. Cost of revenue decreased $523 million or 22% during the three months ended December 31, 2007, primarily driven by decreased Xbox 360 manufacturing costs. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $81 million or 16%, reflecting a decline in Xbox 360 platform marketing expenses. EDD operating income increased during the six months ended December 31, 2007, primarily due to the increased revenue. Headcount-related expenses increased 17% and 14% during the three and six months ended December 31, 2007, respectively, reflecting a 4% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by decreased stock-based compensation expense.
For the remainder of fiscal year 2008, we expect revenue to increase due to increased sales of Xbox 360 consoles and related games, accessories, and services. Revenue from existing mobility and embedded devices is expected to increase due to unit volume increases of Windows Mobile software driven by increased market demand for phone-enabled devices and Windows Embedded operating systems.

During the three and six months ended December 31, 2007, dividends and interest income decreased, reflecting a reduction in the average balance of interest-bearing investments coupled with lower interest rates on our fixed-income investments. Net recognized gains on investments include other-than-temporary impairments of $54 million in the three months ended December 31, 2007 and $69 million in the six months ended December 31, 2007. During the six months ended December 31, 2007, net recognized gains on investments decreased primarily due to lower gains on sales of fixed-income and equity investments coupled with higher other-than-temporary impairments.
During the three and six months ended December 31, 2007, net derivative gains increased primarily due to

losses in the prior year. We use derivative instruments to manage exposures to interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency markets and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses arising from derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are in large part economically offset by unrealized losses and gains, respectively, in the underlying securities, which are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Commodity derivatives are held for the purpose of portfolio diversification. Net losses related to foreign currency contracts relate primarily to changes in time value of options used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues. Additionally, net gains and losses on foreign currency contracts include the changes in the fair value of derivatives used as economic hedges. These gains and losses are partially offset economically by unrealized losses and gains, respectively, in the underlying assets, which are included in other comprehensive income. Other of $130 million for the six months ended December 31, 2007 includes the correction of several immaterial items from prior periods.
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Collateral and/or security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. We anticipate that the magnitude of securities lent under this program will remain relatively consistent during the fiscal year.
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate was 31% for the three and six months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.
On July 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”) Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which provides a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Under FIN 48, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures.
Adopting FIN 48 had the following impact on our financial statements: increased current assets by $228 million, long-term assets by $1.1 billion, long-term liabilities by $2.1 billion, and our retained deficit by $395 million; and decreased our income taxes payable by $394 million. As of July 1, 2007, we had $7.1 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $5.3 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. As of July 1, 2007, we had accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions of $863 million, net of federal income tax benefit, on our balance sheet.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $21.1 billion as of December 31, 2007, compared with $23.4 billion as of June 30, 2007. Equity and other investments were $9.4 billion as of December 31, 2007, compared with $10.1 billion as of June 30, 2007. Our investments consist primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S.-dollar-denominated securities, but also includes foreign-denominated securities in order to diversify financial risk. We invest primarily in short-term securities to facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs. As a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $28.1 billion at December 31, 2007. Our retained deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate or pay dividends given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.

Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements, revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis for Windows XP and previous PC operating systems, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the life cycle of the related product. Other unearned revenue includes services, Microsoft Dynamics business solution products, Xbox Live subscriptions, advertising, and TV platform for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.
The following table outlines the expected recognition of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2007:

Cash Flows
Cash flow from operations for the six months ended December 31, 2007 increased $4.3 billion compared with the same period in fiscal year 2007 to $10.4 billion due to increased cash collections from customers reflecting our continued revenue growth along with $1.0 billion from deferred taxes reflecting the tax impact of changes in unearned revenue. Cash used for financing was $5.9 billion in the first half of fiscal year 2008, a decrease of $4.6 billion compared with the same period in fiscal year 2007. The decrease reflects $7.0 billion of common stock repurchases in the six months ended December 31, 2007, compared with $13.5 billion in the first six months of the prior fiscal year, which included the impact of our tender offer on August 17, 2006. This impact was partially offset by a $1.9 billion decrease in proceeds from issuance of common stock reflecting the JPMorgan exercise of approximately 113 million call options for $3.3 billion in December 2006, which was included in the $4.8 billion of common stock issued during the six months ended December 31, 2006, as compared with $3.0 billion in the current year. Cash used for investing was $3.3 billion in the first half of fiscal year 2008 as compared with cash provided from investing of $4.5 billion in the first half of fiscal 2007, a change of $7.8 billion. This change reflects a $5.4 billion increase in cash paid for acquisition of companies, reflecting the purchase of aQuantive in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, along with a $2.0 billion decrease in cash from combined investment purchases, sales, and maturities.
In January 2008, we announced an offer to purchase all the outstanding shares of Fast Search & Transfer ASA for approximately $1.2 billion in cash. We expect to complete this transaction in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008.
We have no material long-term debt. Stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2007 was $34.4 billion. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and

Table of Contents

computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources.
On July 20, 2006, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized two new share repurchase programs: a $20.0 billion tender offer that was completed on August 17, 2006 and authorization for up to an additional $20.0 billion ongoing share repurchase program with an expiration of June 30, 2011. Under the tender offer, we repurchased approximately 155 million shares of common stock, or 1.5% of our common shares outstanding, for approximately $3.8 billion at a price per share of $24.75. On August 18, 2006, we announced that the authorization for the $20.0 billion ongoing share repurchase program had been increased by approximately $16.2 billion. As a result, we are authorized to repurchase additional shares in an amount up to $36.2 billion through June 30, 2011. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $8.7 billion remained of the $36.2 billion approved repurchase amount.
Our Board of Directors declared the following dividends:

We believe existing cash and equivalents and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations, should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, regular quarterly dividends, and planned share repurchases. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short-term investments, as well as equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. We consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any material liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations, which replaces SFAS No 141. The statement retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions, but requires a number of changes, including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized in the purchase accounting. It also changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies, requires the
 
29
Table of Contents

capitalization of in-process research and development at fair value, and requires the expensing of acquisition-related costs as incurred. SFAS No. 141R is effective for us beginning July 1, 2009 and will apply prospectively to business combinations completed on or after that date.
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB 51, which changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests. Minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and will be reported as a component of equity separate from the parent’s equity, and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control will be accounted for as equity transactions. In addition, net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement and, upon a loss of control, the interest sold, as well as any interest retained, will be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings. SFAS No. 160 is effective for us beginning July 1, 2009 and will apply prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which will apply retrospectively. We are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of SFAS No. 160 would have on our financial statements.
On July 1, 2007, we adopted provisions of FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which provides a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Under FIN 48, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Upon adoption, we recognized a $395 million charge to our beginning retained deficit as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. See Note 13 – Income Taxes (Part I, Item 1).
On July 1, 2007, we adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 06-2 (“EITF 06-2”), Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43. EITF 06-2 requires companies to accrue the costs of compensated absences under a sabbatical or similar benefit arrangement over the requisite service period. Upon adoption, we recognized a $17 million charge to our beginning retained deficit as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 gives us the irrevocable option to carry many financial assets and liabilities at fair values, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for us beginning July 1, 2008, although early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the potential impact that electing fair value measurement would have on our financial statements and have not determined what election we will make.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. This statement is effective for us beginning July 1, 2008. In December 2007, the FASB released a proposed FASB Staff Position (FSP FAS 157-b – Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157) which, if adopted as proposed, would delay the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We currently are assessing the potential impact that adoption of SFAS No. 157 would have on our financial statements.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for contingencies, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for stock-based compensation.
We account for the licensing of software in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (“SOP”) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. The application of SOP 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value exists for those elements. For some of our products, customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. These elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. The fair value of these elements is recognized over the estimated life cycle for the Windows XP and previous PC operating systems. For Windows Vista, there are no significant undelivered elements and accordingly, no license revenue is deferred for Windows Vista sales. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment also is required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.
SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and SAB Topic 5M, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (July 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.

We account for research and development costs in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements, including SFAS No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, and SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS No. 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. This is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. We determined that technological feasibility was reached with Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system during the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 and accordingly, we capitalized approximately $120 million of software development costs. The amortization of these costs will be included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. Previously, costs incurred prior to technological feasibility were not material and were expensed as incurred.
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position, or our cash flows.
SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the requirements of FIN 48.
We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted.
We account for product warranties in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. We provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranty, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business, but generally include technical support, parts, and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranty, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We reevaluate our estimates at least quarterly to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements in Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”), other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “strategy,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section entitled “Risk Factors” (refer to Part II, Item 1A). We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
OVERVIEW
The following MD&A is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements (“Notes”).
We develop, manufacture, license, and support a wide range of software products for many computing devices. Our software products include operating systems for servers, PCs, and intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; information worker productivity applications; business solutions applications; and software development tools. We provide consulting and product support services, and we train and certify system integrators and developers. We sell the Xbox video game console and games, the Zune digital music and entertainment device, PC games, and PC peripherals. Online communication and information services are delivered through our MSN portals, channels around the world, and through our search products.
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Entertainment and Devices Division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, the Entertainment and Devices Division has generated over 40% of its yearly segment revenues in our second fiscal quarter. In fiscal year 2007, our revenue was highest in the third quarter due to the recognition of $1.7 billion of revenue previously deferred from the Express Upgrade to Windows Vista and Microsoft Office Technology Guarantee programs and pre-shipments of Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system. The technology guarantee programs provided customers who purchased current products with free or discounted rights to Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system when those products became available to consumers. We believe the seasonality of revenue is likely to continue in the future consistent with our experience prior to fiscal year 2007.

Revenue growth was driven primarily by increased Xbox console and game sales, licensing of Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system, and increased revenue associated with Windows Server and SQL Server. Revenue from licensing of Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system reflects growth in our OEM channel and growth from Enterprise Agreement licenses. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $205 million or two percentage point increase in revenue during the quarter.
Operating income growth was driven primarily by the increased revenue, partially offset by increased Xbox 360 product costs, warranty expenses, and inventory write-downs; data center costs in our Online Services Business; increased Windows Vista product costs; and increased sales and marketing expenses. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily driven by increased headcount-related expenses and marketing costs related to corporate events and our retail channel. Total headcount-related expenses increased 6%, driven by a 12% increase in headcount over the past twelve months and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by decreased stock-based compensation expense.
Worldwide macroeconomic factors have a strong correlation to business and consumer demand for our software, services, games, and Internet service offerings. We expect a broad continuation of economic conditions and demand during the remainder of fiscal year 2008. We also expect continued double digit revenue growth. Given our product launches in the second half of fiscal year 2007, we expect revenue growth to be higher in the first half of fiscal year 2008 than in the second half. We estimate worldwide PC shipments will grow between 10% and 12%. We expect a continued favorable impact from changes in year-over-year foreign currency exchange rates in fiscal year 2008. We expect our operating income growth rate to continue to exceed our revenue growth rate.
SEGMENT PRODUCT REVENUE/OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)
Revenue and operating income/(loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with U.S. GAAP and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. Segment information appearing in Note 9 – Segment Information is presented on a basis consistent with our current internal management reporting, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Certain corporate-level activity has been excluded from segment operating results and is analyzed separately. Prior period amounts have been recast to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor performance at the segment level in fiscal year 2008.

Client offerings consist of premium edition and standard Windows operating systems. Premium offerings are those that include additional functionality and are sold at a price above our standard versions. Premium offerings include Windows XP Professional, XP Media Center Edition, XP Tablet PC Edition, Vista Business, Vista Home Premium, and Vista Ultimate. Standard Windows operating systems include Windows XP Home and Windows Vista Home Basic. Client revenue growth correlates with the growth of purchases of PCs from OEMs that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for approximately 80% of total Client revenue. The differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from year to year are affected by changes in the mix of OEM Windows operating systems licensed with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total OEM Windows operating systems licensed (“OEM premium mix”), changes in the geographical mix, and changes in the channel mix of products sold by large, multi-national OEMs versus those sold by local and regional system builders.
Client revenue increased primarily reflecting licensing of Windows Vista. OEM revenue increased $706 million or 25% driven by 20% growth in OEM license units. Revenue from commercial and retail licensing of Windows operating systems increased $116 million or 23% primarily due to strong sales from Enterprise Agreements and legalization efforts in Russia, China, and other emerging markets. The OEM Premium Mix increased 16 percentage points to 75% driven by increased consumer premium mix. Based on our estimates, total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew 14% to 16% driven by demand in both emerging and mature markets.
Client operating income increased reflecting the increased revenue and decreased research and development expenses, partially offset by increased cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses. Research and development expenses decreased $70 million or 23% primarily reflecting decreased headcount-related expenses. Cost of revenue increased $109 million or 102% driven by Windows Vista product costs while sales and marketing expenses increased $78 million or 36% primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses associated with our corporate sales force. Headcount-related expenses decreased 21%, driven by a 7% decrease in headcount over the past twelve months due to the redeployment of resources upon the completion of Windows Vista development and decreased stock-based compensation expense.
For the remainder of fiscal year 2008, we expect continued strength in OEM revenue growth, in line with strength in the PC market. We expect PC shipments to grow 10% to 12% for fiscal year 2008. We believe that PC unit growth rates will be higher in the consumer segment than in the business segment and higher in emerging markets than in mature markets.

Server and Tools offerings consist of server software licenses and client access licenses (“CAL”) for Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, and other server products. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier and Professional product support services, and Microsoft Consulting Services. Server and Tools concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. We use multiple channels for licensing including pre-installed OEM versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. We sell licenses both as one-time licenses and as multi-year volume licenses.
Server and Tools revenue increased reflecting growth in both product and services revenue. Server and server application revenue (including CAL revenue) and developer tools, training, and certificate revenue increased $262 million or 13% primarily driven by growth in new and recurring volume licensing of Windows

Server and SQL Server products and reflects broad adoption of the Windows Platform and applications. Consulting, Premier and Professional product support services revenue increased $142 million or 32% primarily due to higher demand for consulting and support services in corporate enterprises. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $65 million or two percentage point increase in revenue.
Server and Tools operating income increased primarily reflecting the increased revenue, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses and cost of revenue for services. Sales and marketing expenses increased $133 million or 18% primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses associated with our corporate sales force. Cost of revenue increased $76 million or 15% reflecting the growth in services provided. Headcount-related expenses increased 4%, driven by a 15% increase in headcount over the past twelve months and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by decreased stock-based compensation expense.
We expect continued revenue growth in both product and services offerings related to the release of new versions of Visual Studio, Windows Server, and SQL Server products.

Online Services Business (“OSB”) provides personal communications services, such as e-mail and instant messaging, online information offerings, such as Live Search, and the MSN portals and channels around the world. OSB also provides a variety of online services such as MSN Internet Access and MSN Premium Web Services. We earn revenue primarily from online advertising, from consumers and partners through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services, and from MSN narrowband Internet access subscribers. We continue to launch new online initiatives and expect to do so in the future. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, we launched a new release of Windows Live Search and a beta version of Windows Live Suite and updated the MSN Video Services.
During the quarter ended September 30, 2007, we completed our acquisition of aQuantive, Inc. for consideration of $5.9 billion. We expect aQuantive, Inc., a digital marketing company, to play a key role in the future development of our advertising business. We believe the acquisition will help us build and support next-generation advertiser and publisher solutions in environments such as cross media planning, video-on-demand, and internet protocol television. aQuantive, Inc. was consolidated into our results of operations starting August 10, 2007, the acquisition date.
OSB revenue increased driven primarily by online advertising revenue which grew $120 million or 33% to $487 million. This increase reflects growth in our existing online advertising business for search, home page, email, and messaging services and includes $29 million of aQuantive online advertising revenue. During the quarter, we also recognized $51 million of aQuantive advertising agency revenue. The increase in revenue was partially offset by a $33 million or 32% decrease in access revenue. As of September 30, 2007 and 2006, we had approximately 405 million and 340 million Windows Live IDs, respectively.
OSB operating loss increased driven primarily by increased cost of revenue, increased sales and marketing expenses, and increased research and development expenses, partially offset by the increased revenue. OSB operating loss includes a $58 million loss from aQuantive, including a $24 million in-process research and

development write-off and $30 million of amortization of intangible assets. The $151 million or 63% increase in cost of revenue was primarily driven by increased data center costs, online content expenses, and aQuantive-related expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $69 million or 42% primarily due to increased marketing costs and amortization of customer-related intangible assets, while research and development expenses increased $60 million or 28% primarily as a result of increased headcount-related expenses and product development costs. Headcount-related expenses increased 10%, driven by a 20% increase in headcount over the past twelve months and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by decreased stock-based compensation expense.
For the remainder of fiscal year 2008, we expect continued growth in online advertising revenue as the portals, channels, and communications services continue to expand globally and the overall Internet advertising market continues to expand. Online advertising revenue is expected to benefit from our acquisition of aQuantive while revenue from narrowband Internet Access is expected to continue to decline.

Microsoft Business Division (“MBD”) offerings consist of the Microsoft Office system and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions. Microsoft Office system products are designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity through a range of programs, services, and software solutions. Growth of revenue from the Microsoft Office system offerings, which generate over 90% of MBD revenue, depends on our ability to add value to the core Office product set and to continue to expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as enterprise content management, collaboration, unified communications, and business intelligence. Microsoft Dynamics products provide business solutions for financial management, customer relationship management, supply chain management, and analytics applications for small and mid-size businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. We evaluate our results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business revenue which includes Microsoft Office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and Microsoft Dynamics revenue, and consumer revenue which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and OEM revenue.
MBD revenue increased primarily reflecting licensing of the 2007 Microsoft Office system. Business revenue increased $663 million or 25% primarily as a result of growth in volume licensing agreement revenue and strong transactional license sales to businesses. The increase in business revenue also included an 18% increase in Microsoft Dynamics customer billings. Consumer revenue increased $29 million or 4% as a result of strong retail packaged product sales partially offset by a reduction of licenses sold through OEMs. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $93 million or two percentage point increase in revenue.
MBD operating income increased reflecting the increased revenue, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses of $152 million or 22% and increased cost of revenue of $49 million or 29%. The increase in sales and marketing expenses primarily reflects increased headcount-related expenses associated with our corporate sales force. The increase in cost of revenue primarily reflects an increase in online costs related to the recent acquisition of Tellme Networks. Headcount-related expenses decreased 2%, driven by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by a 4% increase in headcount over the past twelve months and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount.
For the remainder of fiscal year 2008, we expect revenue to continue to increase over the prior year due to the strong performance of 2007 Microsoft Office system. We continue to develop plans to grow revenue in new areas such as unified communications and through our existing portfolio of Microsoft Dynamics products.

The Entertainment and Devices Division (“EDD”) products include the Microsoft Xbox video game console system, PC games, consumer software and hardware products, the Zune digital music and entertainment device, Mediaroom (our internet protocol television software), the Windows Mobile software platform, the Windows Embedded device operating system, and Windows Automotive. The success of video game consoles is determined by console innovation and quality, the portfolio of video game content for the console, online offerings, and the market share of the console. We believe that the functionality of the Xbox 360 console, games portfolio, and online offerings are well positioned relative to competitive consoles.
EDD revenue increased primarily due to increased Xbox 360 console and game sales. Xbox and PC game revenue increased $895 million or 148% as a result of increased Xbox 360 console sales, video game sales led by Halo 3, and Xbox 360 accessory sales. We shipped 1.8 million Xbox 360 consoles in the current quarter as compared to 0.9 million consoles in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007. Halo 3 was launched in September 2007 and generated approximately $330 million of revenue during the quarter. Increased revenue from sales of consumer hardware products, the Windows Mobile software platform, and Zune was offset by decreased revenue from Mediaroom.
EDD operating income increased primarily due to the increased revenue, partially offset by increased cost of revenue and increased sales and marketing expenses. Cost of revenue increased $584 million or 99% primarily driven by the increase in consoles sold and increased Xbox 360 console warranty expenses and inventory write-downs. Sales and marketing expenses increased $49 million or 23% primarily related to Xbox 360, including Halo 3, and Zune. Headcount-related expenses increased 6%, reflecting a 7% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by decreased stock-based compensation expense.
For the remainder of fiscal year 2008, we expect revenue to increase due to the increased sales of Xbox 360 consoles and related games, accessories, and services, and sales of Zune products. Revenue from existing mobility and embedded devices is expected to increase due to unit volume increases of Windows Mobile software driven by increased market demand for phone-enabled devices and Windows Embedded operating systems.

Dividends and interest income declined, reflecting a decline in the average balance of dividend and interest-bearing investments coupled with lower interest rates received on our fixed-income investments. Net recognized gains decreased primarily due to fewer gains on the sale of equity investments and losses on sales of fixed-income investments in the current period as compared to gains in the prior period. Other-than-temporary impairments were not material in both the three months ended September 30, 2007 and in the prior period. Other of $128 million includes the correction of several immaterial items from prior periods.
We experienced net gains on equity derivatives, interest rate derivatives, and commodity derivatives in the current period as compared to net losses in the prior period. Additionally, net losses on foreign exchange contracts were similar in both the current and prior periods. We use derivative instruments to manage exposures and to facilitate portfolio diversification related to interest rates, equity and commodity prices, and foreign currency markets. Gains and losses arising from derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are in large part economically offset by unrealized losses and gains, respectively, in the underlying securities which are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Net losses related to foreign currency contracts include changes in time value of options used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues.
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Collateral and/or security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. We anticipate that the magnitude of securities loaned under this program will remain relatively consistent during the fiscal year.

Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate was 31% for the three months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006.
On July 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which provides a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Under FIN 48, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures.
Adopting FIN 48 had the following impact on our financial statements: increased current assets by $228 million, long-term assets by $1.1 billion, long-term liabilities by $2.1 billion, and our retained deficit by $395 million; and decreased our income taxes payable by $394 million. As of July 1, 2007, we had $7.1 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $5.3 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. As of July 1, 2007, we had accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions of $863 million, net of federal income tax benefit, on our balance sheet.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash and equivalents and short-term investments totaled $21.6 billion as of September 30, 2007, compared with $23.4 billion as of June 30, 2007. Equity and other investments were $9.7 billion as of September 30, 2007, compared with $10.1 billion as of June 30, 2007. Our investments consist primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S.-dollar-denominated securities, but also includes foreign-denominated securities in order to diversify financial risk. The portfolio is primarily invested in short-term securities to facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs. As a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $28.6 billion at September 30, 2007. Our retained deficit is not expected to impact our future ability to operate or pay dividends given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements, revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis for Windows XP, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the life cycle of the related product. Other unearned revenue includes services, Microsoft Dynamics business solution products, Xbox Live subscriptions, advertising, and TV platform for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.
Unearned revenue as of September 30, 2007 decreased $1.1 billion from June 30, 2007, reflecting recognition of unearned revenue from multi-year licensing that outpaced multi-year licensing deferrals by $845

Cash Flows
Cash flow from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2007, increased $1.8 billion from the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 to $5.9 billion, due to increased cash collections from customers reflecting our continued revenue growth and $2.8 billion from conversion of accounts receivable to cash. The increase also includes an $845 million reduction in cash used for other current assets reflecting the inventory and product costs cash outflow in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 related to Xbox 360 consoles. Cash used for financing was $3.2 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, a decrease of $5.0 billion from the corresponding period in fiscal year 2007. The decrease reflects $2.9 billion of common stock repurchases in the three months ended September 30, 2007, compared with $7.7 billion in the prior year that included the impact of our tender offer completed on August 17, 2006. Cash used for investing was $2.3 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, as compared with cash provided by investing of $6.5 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007. This $8.7 billion decrease in cash from investing activities includes a $5.1 billion increase in cash paid for acquisition of companies, reflecting the purchase of aQuantive in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, and a $3.2 billion decrease in cash from combined investment purchases, sales, and maturities.
We have no material long-term debt. Stockholders’ equity at September 30, 2007, was $32.1 billion. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources.
On July 20, 2006, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized two new share repurchase programs: a $20.0 billion tender offer that was completed on August 17, 2006 and authorization for up to an additional $20.0 billion ongoing share repurchase program with an expiration of June 30, 2011. Under the tender offer, we repurchased approximately 155 million shares of common stock, or 1.5% of our common shares outstanding, for approximately $3.8 billion at a price per share of $24.75. On August 18, 2006, we announced that the authorization for the $20.0 billion ongoing share repurchase program had been increased by approximately $16.2 billion. As a result, we are authorized to repurchase additional shares in an amount up to $36.2 billion through June 30, 2011. As of September 30, 2007, approximately $12.8 billion remained of the $36.2 billion approved repurchase amount.

We believe existing cash and equivalents and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations, should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, regular quarterly dividends, and planned share repurchases. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short-term investments, as well as equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. We consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any material liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
On July 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which provides a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Under FIN 48, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Upon adoption, we recognized a $395 million charge to our beginning retained deficit as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. See Note 13 – Income Taxes (Part I, Item 1).
On July 1, 2007, we adopted the Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 06-2 (“EITF 06-2”), Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43. EITF 06-2 requires companies to accrue the costs of compensated absences under a sabbatical or similar benefit arrangement over the requisite service period. Upon adoption, we recognized a $17 million charge to our beginning retained deficit as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 gives us the irrevocable option to carry many financial assets and liabilities

Table of Contents

at fair values, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for us beginning July 1, 2008, although early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the potential impact that electing fair value measurement would have on our financial statements.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. This statement is effective for us beginning July 1, 2008. We currently are assessing the potential impact that adoption of SFAS No. 157 would have on our financial statements.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for contingencies, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for stock-based compensation.
We account for the licensing of software in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (“SOP”) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. The application of SOP 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value exists for those elements. For some of our products, customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. These elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. The fair value of these elements is recognized over the estimated life cycle for the Windows XP and previous PC operating systems. For Windows Vista, there are no significant undelivered elements and accordingly, no license revenue is deferred for Windows Vista sales. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment also is required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.
SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and SAB Topic 5M, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (July 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition or sale or

disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.
We account for research and development costs in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements, including SFAS No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, and SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS No. 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. This is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. We determined that technological feasibility was reached with Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system during the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 and accordingly, we capitalized approximately $120 million of software development costs. The amortization of these costs will be included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. Previously, costs incurred prior to technological feasibility were not material and were expensed as incurred.
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position, or our cash flows.
SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the requirements of FIN 48.
We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted.
We account for product warranties in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. We provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized.

Table of Contents

For hardware warranty, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business, but generally include technical support, parts, and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranty, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We reevaluate our estimates at least quarterly to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.

OVERVIEW
The following MD&A is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements (“Notes”).
We develop, manufacture, license, and support a wide range of software products for many computing devices. Our software products include operating systems for servers, PCs, and intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; information worker productivity applications; business solutions applications; and software development tools. We provide consulting and product support services, and we train and certify system integrators and developers. We sell the Xbox video game console and games, the Zune digital music and entertainment device, PC games, and PC peripherals. Online communication and information services are delivered through our MSN portals, channels around the world, and Live Search capabilities.
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Entertainment and Devices Division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, Entertainment and Devices has generated over 40% of its yearly segment revenues in our second fiscal quarter. We believe the seasonality of revenue is likely to continue in the future.

For the three months ended March 31, 2007, our revenue growth was driven primarily by licensing of Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system, both of which became available to consumers in January 2007, and increased licensing of Windows Server, SQL Server, and Visual Studio. During the quarter, we

recognized approximately $1.7 billion of revenue previously deferred from the Express Upgrade to Windows Vista and Microsoft Office Technology Guarantee programs and pre-shipments of Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system. The technology guarantee programs provided consumers who purchased current products with free or discounted rights to Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system when those products became available to consumers. Our revenue increase for the nine months ended March 31, 2007 was driven primarily by licensing of Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system, sales of the Xbox 360 console which was launched in November 2005, and increased licensing of SQL Server, Windows Server, and Visual Studio.
For the three months ended March 31, 2007, operating income increased driven primarily by the increased revenue, partially offset by increased headcount-related costs and increased marketing and advertising expenses primarily related to our recent product launches. The increase in operating income during the quarter also reflects a decrease in cost of revenue due to a shift to products with higher margins. For the nine months ended March 31, 2007, operating income increased driven primarily by the increased revenue, partially offset by increased costs of revenue associated with the Xbox 360 console and increased headcount-related costs as we continue to invest in offerings such as the Windows Live platform and recently launched products such as the 2007 Microsoft Office system, Windows Vista and Zune. Headcount-related costs, increased 15% during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2007, reflecting a 13% increase in headcount over the past 12 months and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
We expect revenue to continue to grow during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 compared to the same quarter of the prior year primarily due to our recent product launches. We estimate that PC unit growth for the quarter will be 10% to 12%. Within the overall PC market, we expect current trends to continue with consumer segment growth exceeding that of the business segment and emerging market growth exceeding that of mature markets. We also expect operating income to continue to grow during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 compared to the same quarter of the prior year.

Client consists of premium edition and standard Windows operating systems. Premium offerings are those that include additional functionality and are sold at a price above our standard versions. Premium offerings include Windows XP Professional, XP Media Center Edition, XP Tablet PC Edition, Vista Business, Vista Home Premium, and Vista Ultimate. Standard Windows operating systems include Windows XP Home and Windows Vista Home Basic. Client revenue growth correlates with the growth of purchases of PCs from OEMs that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for approximately 80% of total Client revenue. The differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from year to year are affected by changes in the mix of OEM Windows operating systems licensed with premium edition operating

systems as a percentage of total OEM Windows operating systems licensed (“OEM premium mix”), changes in the geographical mix, and the channel mix of products sold by large, multi-national OEMs versus those sold by local and regional system builders.
Client revenue increased for the three months ended March 31, 2007, primarily reflecting licensing of Windows Vista, including recognition of approximately $1.2 billion of revenue previously deferred in fiscal year 2007 pending the January 2007 release to consumers. The increased revenue also reflects 20% growth in OEM license units from increased PC unit shipments and retail sales. During the quarter, the OEM premium mix increased 18 percentage points over the prior year to 71% driven by the demand for Windows Vista Home Premium. Client revenue increased during the nine months ended March 31, 2007, reflecting the increased revenue primarily associated with Windows Vista and 13% growth in OEM license units from increased PC unit shipments. The increase during the nine months ended March 31, 2007 also reflects growth in OEM revenue of $1.0 billion or 13% and growth in commercial and retail licensing of Windows operating systems of $384 million or 27%. Based on our preliminary estimates, total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew 10% to 12% from the third quarter of the previous year and approximately 8% to 10% from the first nine months of the previous year driven by strong consumer demand in both emerging and mature markets.
Client operating income increased during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2007, reflecting the increased revenue, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses associated with the recent launch and increased costs of revenue, including support costs. Headcount-related costs increased 6% during the three months ended March 31, 2007, reflecting an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 1% increase in headcount, partially offset by decreased stock-based compensation expense. Headcount-related costs remained flat during the nine months ended March 31, 2007.
We expect revenue to continue to grow during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, reflecting improvement in the commercial and retail portion of the business due to the launch of Windows Vista. We believe that PC unit growth rates will be higher in the consumer segment than in the business segment and higher in emerging markets than in mature markets.

Server and Tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (“CAL”) for Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, and other server products. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier and Professional product support services, and Microsoft Consulting Services. Server and Tools concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content, and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. The segment uses multiple channels for licensing including pre-installed OEM versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. We sell licenses both as one-time licenses and as multi-year volume licenses.
Server and server application revenue, including CAL revenue, and developer tools, training and certification revenue, increased $237 million or 12% during the three months and $880 million or 15% during the nine months ended March 31, 2007. This increase was primarily driven by increased revenue associated with Windows Server, SQL Server, and Visual Studio, and reflects broad adoption of Windows Server products. Overall revenue growth was also driven by Consulting, Premier, and Professional product support services revenue which grew $116 million or 28% during the three months and $252 million or 20% during the nine months ended March 31, 2007.

Server and Tools operating income increased during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2007, primarily reflecting the increased revenue, partially offset by increased headcount-related costs and cost of revenue for services. Headcount-related costs increased 11% in the three months and 12% in the nine months ended March 31, 2007, respectively, reflecting an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 13% increase in headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation. Cost of revenue increased $63 million or 13% in the third quarter and $156 million or 11% in the first nine months of fiscal year 2007, reflecting the growth in consulting services provided.
We expect continued revenue growth from fiscal year 2006 product launches and the expansion of our products in security, management and overall Windows Server growth during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007. Market analysts currently forecast 4% to 6% growth in server hardware unit shipments in fiscal year 2007. In addition to server hardware growth, overall Server and Tools revenue is influenced by a number of factors, including spending on information technology services, licensing and purchasing patterns of enterprise companies, spending on database tools and management software and our ability to grow in those areas. Additional factors include our ability to develop and bring new products to market.

Online Services Business (“OSB”) includes personal communications services, such as e-mail and instant messaging, and online information offerings, such as Live Search, and the MSN portals and channels around the world. OSB also provides a variety of online services such as MSN Internet Access, MSN Premium Web Services and One Care. We derive revenue primarily from online advertising, from consumers and partners through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services, and from MSN narrowband Internet access subscribers. We have transitioned to adCenter, our own platform for online delivery of advertising. We continue to launch new online initiatives and expect to do so in the future. In the first nine months of fiscal year 2007, we launched Live Search and Live.com in 54 international markets, Live Local Search in the U.S. and U.K., beta versions of MSN Soapbox (our expansion of the MSN Video experience), Virtual Earth TM 3D, and other offerings.
OSB revenue increased during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2007, primarily driven by advertising revenue which increased $85 million or 23% to $456 million and $179 million or 16% to $1.3 billion, respectively, due primarily to growth in advertising for home page, email, and messaging services. The advertising revenue increases were partially offset by a $37 million or 31% and a $122 million or 31% decline in access revenue in the respective three and nine month periods. At March 31, 2007, OSB had 1.5 million access subscribers and 11 million total subscribers compared with 2.3 million access subscribers and 10.1 million total subscribers at March 31, 2006. In addition, we estimate that OSB has over 285 million active Hotmail accounts and over 278 million active Messenger accounts.
OSB operating income decreased for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2007, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related costs mainly as a result of continued investments in Windows Live and other properties, and increased cost of revenue as a result of costs associated with our data centers. Headcount-related costs increased 31% and 36%, respectively, during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2007, reflecting both a 24% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by decreased stock-based compensation expense.

Microsoft Business Division (“MBD”) consists of programs, servers, services, and solutions designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. MBD includes the Microsoft Office system, Microsoft Dynamics, and the Microsoft Partner Program. MBD also includes the Small and Mid-market Solutions & Partners organization, which focuses on helping Microsoft, its customers, and industry partners in the small and mid-market customer segments. Our Office System products represent over 90% of Microsoft Business Division revenues and include Microsoft Office, Microsoft Exchange Server and CALs, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, Microsoft Office Communications Server, Microsoft Office SharePoint Server and CALs, Microsoft LiveMeeting, and OneNote. We grow revenue by adding value to the core Office product set and expanding our product offerings in other information worker and business solution areas such as document lifecycle management, collaboration, business intelligence, customer relationship management, and enterprise resource planning. We evaluate our results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts—business revenue which includes revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and Microsoft Dynamics, and consumer revenue which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales, OEM revenue, and sales of pre-installed versions of Office in Japan.
MBD revenue increased during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2007, primarily reflecting sales of the 2007 Microsoft Office system, which was launched to consumers in January 2007. Revenue from consumer sales increased $727 million or 81% during the three months ended March 31, 2007, reflecting the recognition of approximately $500 million of revenue previously deferred in fiscal year 2007 prior to the launch. Revenue from business sales increased $493 million or 18% and included a 20% increase in Microsoft Dynamics customer billings. During the nine months ended March 31, 2007, revenue from consumer sales increased $239 million or 9% while revenue from business sales increased $944 million or 12%.
MBD operating income increased during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2007, reflecting the increase in revenue partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing expenses and cost of revenue associated with the 2007 Microsoft Office system. During the three and nine months ended March 31, 2007, headcount-related costs increased 9% and 10%, respectively, reflecting a 7% increase in headcount over the past 12 months and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by decreased stock-based compensation expense.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, we expect revenue to continue to increase over the prior year due to the recent launch of the 2007 Microsoft Office system. We continue to develop plans to grow revenue in new areas such as unified communications and through our existing portfolio of Microsoft Dynamics products.

Entertainment and Devices Division (“EDD”) products include the Microsoft Xbox video game console system, PC games, consumer software and hardware products, the Zune digital music and entertainment device, TV platform products for the interactive television industry, and Mobile and Embedded devices (principally Windows Mobile software platform and Windows Embedded device operating system). The success of video game consoles is determined by console innovation, the portfolio of video game content for the console, online offerings, and the market share of the console. We believe that the functionality of the Xbox 360 console, games portfolio, and online offerings are well-positioned relative to competitive consoles launched during 2006.
EDD revenue decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2007 primarily because of decreased Xbox 360 console sales. During the quarter, we shipped 0.5 million Xbox 360 consoles as compared to 1.7 million consoles in the third quarter of fiscal year 2006, which was the first full quarter of Xbox 360 console sales. Xbox and PC game revenue decreased $393 million or 44% during the three months ended March 31, 2007 due to the decrease in console sales. Revenue from Zune, consumer hardware and software, and TV platforms increased $103 million or 61% during the three months ended March 31, 2007, primarily reflecting the recent release of Zune and new consumer hardware products. Mobile and Embedded Devices revenue increased $38 million or 30% during the three months ended March 31, 2007 driven by sales growth in Windows Mobile software and Windows Embedded operating systems.
EDD revenue increased during the nine months ended March 31, 2007 primarily due to increased Xbox 360 console sales, sales of Zune, and increased Xbox accessories and video game sales. We shipped approximately 5.9 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first nine months of fiscal year 2007. Since the Xbox 360 console was launched in November 2005, we have shipped approximately 11 million units. Xbox and PC game revenue increased $914 million or 37% during the nine months ended March 31, 2007 as a result of the increased number of consoles sold and related accessories and video game sales. Revenue from Zune, consumer hardware and software, and TV platforms increased $426 million or 68% during the nine months ended March 31, 2007, primarily reflecting the release of Zune and new consumer hardware products. Mobile and Embedded Devices revenue increased $109 million or 31% during the nine months ended March 31, 2007, driven by sales growth in Windows Mobile software and Windows Embedded operating systems.
EDD operating loss decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2007 primarily due to decreased products costs from lower sales of Xbox 360 consoles and increased Mobile and Embedded Devices revenue, partially offset by expenses related to the launch of Zune and increased Xbox 360 console warranty expenses. EDD operating loss decreased during the nine months ended March 31, 2007 primarily due to increased Xbox 360 platform sales and improved Xbox 360 console margins, partially offset by expenses related to the launch of Zune and increased Xbox 360 console warranty expenses. Headcount-related costs increased 10% and 13% during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2007, reflecting an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 13% increase in headcount, partially offset by decreased stock-based compensation expense.
For fiscal year 2007, we expect revenue to increase due to the increased availability of Xbox 360 during the entire fiscal year and sales of Zune after its November 2006 launch. Revenue from mobility and embedded devices is expected to increase due to unit volume increases of Windows Mobile software driven by increased market demand for phone-enabled devices and Windows Embedded operating systems.

Corporate-level expenses increased during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2007, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related costs, partially offset by decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. Headcount-related costs increased 27% during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2007, reflecting a 22% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount. During the three months ended March 31, 2007 and 2006, we incurred $296 million and $397 million, respectively, of legal charges primarily related to antitrust and unfair competition consumer class actions, intellectual property claims, and extension payments to Sun Microsystems, Inc. under our existing Limited Patent Covenant and Standstill Agreement. During the nine months ended March 31, 2007 and 2006, we incurred $494 million and $913 million, respectively, in legal charges. Legal charges during the first nine months of fiscal year 2006 included a $361 million charge related to our settlement with RealNetworks, Inc.

Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Research and development costs increased during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2007, primarily because of increased headcount-related costs, which were partially offset during the nine-month period by the capitalization of approximately $120 million of certain software development costs primarily associated with Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system. Headcount-related costs increased 11% and 8% during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2007, respectively, reflecting a 14% increase in headcount, an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, and an offsetting impact of four percentage points in the nine months ended

For the three months and nine months ended March 31, 2007, dividends and interest income declined, reflecting a decline in the average balance of dividend and interest-bearing investments, partly offset by higher interest rates received on our fixed-income investments. Other-than-temporary impairments in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 were not material For the nine months ended March 31, 2007, net recognized gains increased primarily due to gains on sales of fixed-income investments in the current period as compared to losses in the prior period, partly offset by fewer gains on the sale of equity investments in the current period as compared to the prior period.
We use derivative instruments to manage exposures to interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency markets and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses arising from derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are in large part economically offset by unrealized losses and gains, respectively, in the underlying securities which are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Commodity derivatives are held for the purpose of portfolio diversification. Net losses related to foreign currency contracts relate primarily to changes in time value of options used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues. Additionally, net gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts include the changes in the fair value of derivatives used as economic hedges. These gains and losses are partially offset economically by unrealized losses and gains, respectively, in the underlying assets which are included in other comprehensive income.
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Collateral and/or security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. We anticipate that the magnitude of securities lent under this program will remain relatively consistent during the fiscal year.
Income Taxes
The effective tax rate was 29% and 30% for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2007, respectively. The effective tax rate was 31% and 30% for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006, respectively. The fiscal year 2007 rate reflects an increase in the recurring effective tax rate to 31.5% due to a higher mix of earnings in high-rate tax jurisdictions and was offset by a $195 million reduction resulting from various changes in tax positions taken in prior periods, related primarily to favorable developments in an IRS position and multiple foreign audit assessments.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash and equivalents and short-term investments totaled $28.2 billion as of March 31, 2007, compared to $34.2 billion as of June 30, 2006. Equity and other investments were $9.6 billion as of March 31, 2007, compared to $9.2 billion as of June 30, 2006. Our investments consist primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S.-dollar-denominated securities, but also includes foreign-denominated securities in order to diversify financial risk. As a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $25.9 billion at March 31, 2007. Our retained deficit is not expected to impact our future ability to operate or pay dividends given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified

upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the life cycle of the related product. Other unearned revenue includes services, TV platform, Microsoft Business Solutions, advertising, and subscriptions for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.
Unearned revenue as of March 31, 2007 decreased $1.6 billion from December 31, 2006, primarily reflecting recognition of the $1.7 billion previously deferred for the technology guarantee programs and pre-shipments of Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system. Unearned revenue decreased $619 million from June 30, 2006, as a result of recognition of unearned revenue from multi-year licensing outpacing deferrals by $715 million, a $98 million decrease in revenue deferred for undelivered elements, and a $194 million increase primarily in unearned revenue for services and promotional EDD product.
The following table outlines the expected recognition of unearned revenue as of March 31, 2007:

Cash Flows
Cash flow from operations for the nine months ended March 31, 2007 increased $2.3 billion from the first nine months of fiscal year 2006 to $13.4 billion due to an increase in cash received from customers, including an increase in accounts receivable collections of $643 million. The increase also reflects a reduction in cash paid for income taxes, including changes in deferred taxes of $859 million. Cash used for financing was $17.6 billion in the first nine months of fiscal year 2007, an increase of $1.7 billion from the corresponding period in fiscal year 2006. Several events occurred during the first nine months of fiscal year 2007 that affected cash used for financing. JPMorgan exercised approximately 113 million call options for $3.3 billion in December 2006 which was included in the $5.6 billion of common stock issued during the nine months ended March 31, 2007, an increase of $3.7 billion from the same period in fiscal year 2006. We also completed our tender offer on August 17, 2006, which was included in the $20.4 billion of common stock repurchases in the nine months ended March 31, 2007, an increase of $5.1 billion from the same period in fiscal year 2006. Cash from investing was $5.0 billion in the first nine months of fiscal year 2007, an increase of $750 million from the first nine months of fiscal year 2006, due to a $3.0 billion increase in net cash from combined investment purchases, sales, and maturities, partially offset by increased additions to property and equipment and a decline in returns from our securities lending program in which we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns.
We have no material long-term borrowings. Stockholders’ equity at March 31, 2007, was $35.0 billion. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or

On July 20, 2006, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized two new share repurchase programs: a $20 billion tender offer, which was completed on August 17, 2006; and authorization for up to an additional $20 billion ongoing share repurchase program with an expiration of June 30, 2011. Under the tender offer, we repurchased approximately 155 million shares of common stock, or 1.5% of our common shares outstanding, for approximately $3.8 billion at a price per share of $24.75. On August 18, 2006, we announced that the authorization for the $20 billion ongoing share repurchase program had been increased by approximately $16.2 billion. As a result, we are authorized to repurchase additional shares in an amount up to $36.2 billion through June 30, 2011. As of March 31, 2007, approximately $22.52 billion remained of the $36.2 billion approved repurchase amount.
We believe existing cash and equivalents and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations, should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, regular quarterly dividends, and planned share repurchases. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short-term investments, as well as equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. We consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any material liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Current Year Misstatements. SAB No. 108 requires analysis of misstatements using both an income statement (rollover) approach and a balance sheet (iron curtain) approach in assessing materiality and provides for a one-time cumulative effect

Table of Contents

transition adjustment. SAB No. 108 is effective for our fiscal year 2007 annual financial statements. We are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of SAB No. 108 will have on our financial statements.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. This statement is effective for us beginning July 1, 2008. We are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on our financial statements.
In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 requires recognition of tax benefits that satisfy a greater than 50% probability threshold. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN No. 48 is effective for us beginning July 1, 2007. We are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of FIN No. 48 will have on our financial statements.
In June 2006, the FASB ratified the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) consensus on EITF Issue No. 06-2, “Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43”. EITF Issue No. 06-2 requires companies to accrue the costs of compensated absences under a sabbatical or similar benefit arrangement over the requisite service period. EITF Issue No. 06-2 is effective for us beginning July 1, 2007. The cumulative effect of the application of this consensus on prior period results should be recognized through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. Elective retrospective application is also permitted. We are currently assessing the financial impact of this guidance and the method of adoption that will be used.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for stock-based compensation.
We account for the licensing of software in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (“SOP”) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. The application of SOP 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value exists for those elements. For some of our products, customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. These elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. The fair value of these elements is recognized over the estimated life cycle for the Windows XP and previous operating systems. For Windows Vista, there are no significant undelivered elements and accordingly, no license revenue is deferred for Windows Vista sales. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.

Table of Contents

SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and SAB 59, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (July 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.
We account for research and development costs in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements, including SFAS No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, and SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS No. 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. This is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2007, we determined that technological feasibility was reached with Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system. Accordingly, we capitalized approximately $120 million of software development costs during the quarter. No amounts were capitalized during the third quarter of fiscal year 2007. Previously, such costs were expensed. The amortization of these costs will be included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position, or our cash flows.

SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 5.
We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted.

OVERVIEW
The following MD&A is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements (“Notes”).
We develop, manufacture, license, and support a wide range of software products for many computing devices. Our software products include operating systems for servers, PCs, and intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; information worker productivity applications; business solutions applications; and software development tools. We provide consulting and product support services, and we train and certify system integrators and developers. We sell the Xbox video game console and games, the Zune digital music and entertainment device, PC games, and PC peripherals. Online communication and information services are delivered through our MSN portals and channels around the world and Live Search.
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Entertainment and Devices Division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, Entertainment and Devices has generated over 40% of its yearly segment revenues in our second fiscal quarter. We believe the seasonality of revenue is likely to continue in the future.

For the three and six months ended December 31, 2006, revenue growth was impacted by the $1.6 billion second quarter revenue deferral from the Express Upgrade to Windows Vista and Microsoft Office Technology Guarantee programs and pre-shipments of Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system. The technology guarantee programs provide consumers who purchase current products with free or discounted rights to Windows

Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system when those products become available to consumers. Our revenue increase for the three and six months ended December 31, 2006 was driven primarily by sales of the Xbox 360 console which was launched in November 2005, sales of Zune, our digital music and entertainment device which was launched in November 2006, and increased licensing of SQL Server, Windows Server, and Visual Studio.
For the three months and six months ended December 31, 2006, operating income decreased primarily reflecting the revenue deferral, a shift to products with lower margins, and increased headcount-related costs as we continue to invest in our new and upcoming offerings such as the 2007 Microsoft Office system, the Windows Live platform, and Zune. Headcount-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, increased 10% and 16%, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2006, reflecting a 15% increase in headcount over the past 12 months, an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, and offsetting impacts of five and two percentage points, respectively, resulting from the capitalization of certain software development costs.
For the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect revenue to grow at a higher rate than fiscal year 2006, mainly reflecting significant product launches in fiscal year 2007. We expect to recognize the $1.6 billion of revenue deferred in the second quarter with the consumer launch of Windows Vista and 2007 Microsoft Office system during the third quarter of fiscal year 2007. We expect our operating income growth rate in fiscal year 2007 will lag behind our revenue growth rate. We expect our level of spending to increase in four key areas in fiscal year 2007: increased product costs associated with Xbox consoles and Zune devices; marketing and field sales spending including product launch costs; quickening the pace of development in growth areas such as business intelligence, security, management and unified communications (including through acquisitions); and increased costs to execute on our online services strategy. While these investments will translate into increased operating expenses, we believe they will help lay the groundwork for future growth and profitability.

Client consists of premium edition operating systems, including Windows XP Professional, Media Center Edition, Tablet PC Edition, and standard Windows operating systems, including Windows XP Home and Windows Vista. Premium offerings are Windows operating systems sold at a premium above Windows XP Home. Client revenue growth correlates with the growth of purchases of PCs from OEMs that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for approximately 80% of total Client revenue.
Client revenue decreased for the three months ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflecting approximately $1.1 billion of revenue deferred as a result of the Express Upgrade to Windows Vista program and shipments

currently in the channel that will be recognized upon consumer launch of Windows Vista. This revenue deferral was partially offset by 10% growth in OEM license units from increased PC unit shipments. During the quarter, the mix of OEM Windows operating systems licensed with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total OEM Windows operating systems licensed (“OEM Premium Mix”) increased 18 percentage points to 67% over the prior year driven by the continued demand for Windows Media Center Edition. The differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from year to year are affected by changes in the OEM Premium Mix, changes in the geographical mix, and the channel mix of products sold by large, multi-national OEMs versus those sold by local and regional system builders. Client revenue decreased during the six months ended December 31, 2006, reflecting the revenue deferrals, partially offset by 11% growth in OEM license units from increased PC unit shipments. Based on our preliminary estimates, total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew 8% to 10% from the second quarter of the previous year and approximately 8% to 10% from the first half of the previous year driven by strong consumer demand in both emerging and mature markets.
Client operating income decreased during the three and six months ended December 31, 2006, reflecting the decreased revenue and increased costs of sales, including support costs, which were partially offset by decreased research and development expenses reflecting the capitalization of certain Windows Vista software development costs in the second quarter of fiscal year 2007. Headcount-related costs decreased 25% and 3%, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2006, reflecting an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, a 5% increase in headcount, and offsetting impacts of 32 and 16 percentage points, respectively, resulting from the capitalization of certain software development costs.
For the remainder of fiscal year 2007, we expect revenue to grow reflecting improvement in the commercial and retail portion of the business due to the launch of Windows Vista. We expect our third quarter revenue to increase significantly as we recognize the $1.1 billion of revenue that was deferred in the second quarter. We expect PC shipments to grow 8% to 10% for fiscal year 2007. We believe that PC unit growth rates will be higher in the consumer segment than in the business segment and higher in emerging markets than in mature markets.

Server and Tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (“CAL”) for Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, and other server products. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier and Professional product support services, and Microsoft Consulting Services. Server and Tools concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content, and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. The segment uses multiple channels for licensing including pre-installed OEM versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. The licenses are sold both as one-time licenses and as multi-year volume licenses.
Server and server application revenue, including CAL revenue, and developer tools, training and certification revenue, increased $319 million or 16% during the three months and $643 million or 17% during the six months ended December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily driven by increased revenue associated with SQL Server, Windows Server, and Visual Studio and reflects broad adoption of Windows Server products. SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio 2005 were launched in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 and continue to produce revenue growth with SQL Server growing over 30% for the quarter and first half of fiscal year 2007. Overall revenue growth was also driven by Consulting, Premier, and Professional product support services revenue which grew $88 million or 20% during the three months and $136 million or 16% during the six months ended December 31, 2006.

Server and Tools operating income increased during the three and six months ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflecting the increased revenue, partially offset by increased headcount-related costs and cost of revenue for services. Headcount-related costs increased 11% and 12% in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2007, respectively, reflecting both an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 14% increase in headcount. Cost of revenue increased $49 million or 10% in the second quarter and $92 million or 10% in the first half of fiscal year 2007, reflecting the growth in consulting services provided.
We expect continued revenue growth from fiscal year 2006 product launches and the expansion of our products in security, management and overall Windows Server growth in fiscal year 2007. We continue to estimate that overall server hardware unit shipments will grow 10% to 12% in fiscal year 2007.

Online Services Business (“OSB”) includes personal communications services, such as e-mail and instant messaging, and online information offerings, such as Live Search, and the MSN portals and channels around the world. OSB also provides a variety of online services such as MSN Internet Access, MSN Premium Web Services and One Care. Revenue is derived primarily from advertisers on MSN.com and Live Search, from consumers and partners through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services, and from MSN narrowband Internet access subscribers. AdCenter – our internally developed advertising platform – now serves all paid search traffic on our online properties in the U.S. and in certain international markets. We continue to launch new online initiatives and expect to do so in the future. For example, in the first half of fiscal year 2007, we have launched Live Search and Live.com in 47 international markets, Live Local Search in the U.S. and U.K., beta versions of MSN Soapbox (our expansion of the MSN Video experience), Virtual Earth TM 3D and other offerings.
OSB revenue increased during the three months ended December 31, 2006, primarily driven by advertising revenue which increased $77 million or 20% to $462 million, due primarily to growth in display advertising for home page, portals, channels, email, and messaging services, partially offset by a $42 million or 31% decrease in access revenue. OSB revenue was flat during the six months ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflecting advertising revenue growth of $94 million or 13% to $836 million, which was offset by a $85 million or 30% decrease in access revenue. The increase in advertising revenue during the six months ended December 31, 2006 reflects increased display revenue partially offset by decreased search revenue as a result of the ongoing transition to adCenter. At December 31, 2006, OSB had 1.8 million access subscribers and 10.7 million total subscribers compared with 2.5 million access subscribers and 9.8 million total subscribers at December 31, 2005. In addition, we estimate that OSB has over 268 million active Hotmail accounts and over 263 million active Messenger accounts.
OSB operating income decreased for the three and six months ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related costs primarily as a result of continued investments in Windows Live, adCenter, and other properties, and increased cost of revenue as a result of the continued build out of our data center infrastructure. Headcount-related costs increased 36% and 39%, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2006, reflecting both a 36% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount.
For the remainder of fiscal year 2007, we expect increased growth in display advertising revenue as the portals, channels, and communications services continue to expand globally and the overall Internet advertising

market continues to expand. Search revenue is expected to benefit from the transition to adCenter in fiscal year 2007 despite market share pressure on search queries, while revenue from narrowband Internet Access is expected to continue to decline.

Microsoft Business Division (“MBD”) consists of programs, servers, services, and solutions designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. MBD includes the Microsoft Office system, Microsoft Dynamics, and the Microsoft Partner Program. MBD also includes the Small and Mid-market Solutions & Partners organization, which focuses on helping Microsoft, its customers, and industry partners in the small and mid-market customer segments. Our Office System products represent over 90% of Microsoft Business Division revenues and include Microsoft Office, Microsoft Exchange Server and CALs, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, Microsoft Office Communications Server, Sharepoint Portal Server and CALs, Microsoft LiveMeeting, and One Note. Revenue growth depends on the ability to add value to the core Office product set and expand our product offerings in other information worker and business solution areas such as document lifecycle management, collaboration, business intelligence, customer relationship management, and enterprise resource planning.
MBD revenue decreased during the three and six months ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflecting approximately $500 million of revenue deferred during the second quarter as a result of the Microsoft Office Technology Guarantee program and shipments currently in the channel that will be recognized upon the launch of the 2007 Microsoft Office system. Non-OEM revenue, which includes volume licensing, retail packaged products, and preinstalled versions of Office in Japan, decreased $170 million or 5% during the three months ended December 31, 2006, reflecting $312 million of revenue deferred for the Microsoft Office Technology Guarantee program and 2007 Microsoft Office system shipments currently in the channel. OEM revenue decreased $7 million or 2%, reflecting $188 million of revenue deferred for the Microsoft Office Technology Guarantee program. During the six months ended December 31, 2006, OEM revenue decreased $11 million or 1% while non-OEM revenue, which reflects a 19% increase in Microsoft Dynamics customer billings, remained flat.
MBD operating income decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2006, reflecting the decrease in revenue and an increase in sales and marketing expenses primarily related to the 2007 Microsoft Office system. MBD operating income decreased during the six months ended December 31, 2006, reflecting the decrease in revenue and an increase in costs associated with the 2007 Microsoft Office system. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2006, headcount-related costs increased 5% and 11%, respectively, reflecting an 8% increase in headcount over the past 12 months, an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, and offsetting impacts of five and three percentage points, respectively, resulting from the capitalization of certain software development costs.
For the remainder of fiscal year 2007, we expect revenue growth in both non-OEM and OEM offerings due to the launch of the 2007 Microsoft Office system. We expect our third quarter revenue to increase significantly as we recognize the approximately $500 million of revenue that was deferred in the second quarter. We continue to develop plans to drive revenue growth in new areas such as unified communications and through our existing portfolio of Microsoft Dynamics products.

Entertainment and Devices Division (“EDD”) products include the Microsoft Xbox video game console system, PC games, consumer software and hardware products, the Zune digital music and entertainment device, TV platform products for the interactive television industry, and Mobile and Embedded devices (principally Windows Mobile software platform and Windows Embedded device operating system). The success of video game consoles is determined by console innovation, the portfolio of video game content for the console, online offerings, and the market share of the console. We believe that the functionality of the Xbox 360 console, games portfolio, and online offerings are well-positioned relative to competitive consoles launched during the quarter. We also believe launching in advance of competing consoles will provide a strategic advantage for the long-term success of Xbox 360.
EDD revenue increased during the three and six months ended December 31, 2006, primarily driven by increased Xbox 360 console sales, sales of Zune after its November 2006 launch, and increased Xbox accessories and video game sales led by the Xbox 360 title Gears of War. Xbox and PC game revenue increased by approximately $1.0 billion or 76% during the three months and $1.3 billion or 82% during the six months ended December 31, 2006, as a result of higher console volumes and related accessories and video game sales. We sold approximately 4.4 million Xbox 360 consoles during the second quarter and approximately 5.4 million Xbox 360 consoles during the first half of fiscal year 2007. Since the Xbox 360 console was launched in November 2005, we have sold approximately 10.4 million units. Revenue from Zune, consumer hardware and software, and TV platforms increased $260 million or 104% during the three months and $323 or 71% during the six months ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflecting the recent release of Zune, new consumer hardware products, and deployments of MSTV products. Mobile and Embedded Devices revenue increased $29 million or 22% during the three months and $71 million or 31% during the six months ended December 31, 2006, driven by sales growth in Windows Mobile software and Windows Embedded operating systems. Increased revenue for Windows Mobile software was primarily driven by increased market demand for phone-enabled PDAs and Smartphones, partially offset by decreased volume shipments for standalone PDAs. The increase in Windows Embedded revenue was due to our operating system being included in new product designs for both new and existing customers.
EDD operating loss in the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 was flat relative to the prior year and decreased during the six months ended December 31, 2006, reflecting increased revenue and lower Xbox 360 console per unit cost of goods sold, offset by development and marketing expenses primarily related to Xbox and the launch of Zune, and increased Xbox 360 console warranty and repair expenses. Xbox 360 console warranty and repair expenses were primarily driven by the extension of the Xbox 360 console product warranty from 90 days to one year in the United States and Canada. Headcount-related costs increased 12% and 15% during the three and six months ended December 31, 2006, reflecting both an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 17% increase in headcount.
In fiscal year 2007, we expect revenue to increase due to the increased availability of Xbox 360 during the entire fiscal year and sales of Zune after its November 2006 launch. The availability of a commercial IPTV product is expected to drive growth in MSTV revenue across several geographies. Revenue from existing mobility and embedded devices is expected to increase due to unit volume increases of Windows Mobile software driven by increased market demand for phone-enabled devices and Windows Embedded operating systems. Short product life cycles in product lines such as Windows Mobile software may impact our continuing revenue streams.

Certain corporate-level results are not allocated to our segments. Those results include expenses related to corporate operations associated with broad-based sales and marketing, product support services, human resources, legal, finance, information technology, corporate development and procurement activities, research and development and other costs, and legal settlements and contingencies.
Corporate-level expenses increased during the three months ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related costs and increased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. Corporate-level expenses decreased during the six months ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflecting decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies partially offset by increased headcount-related costs. We incurred $111 million and $198 million in legal charges during the three and six months ended December 31, 2006, respectively, as compared to $66 million and $515 million in legal charges during the three and six months ended December 31, 2005, respectively. Legal costs during the first half of fiscal year 2006 included a $361 million charge related to our settlement with RealNetworks, Inc. Headcount-related costs increased 24% and 27% during the three and six months ended December 31, 2006, respectively, reflecting both an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 24% increase in headcount.

Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Research and development costs increased during the three and six months ended December 31, 2006, primarily as a result of increased headcount-related costs and development costs associated with new offerings including our Windows

Live platform, Windows Vista, the 2007 Microsoft Office system, Unified Communications, and Zune. The increases in research and development costs were partially offset by the capitalization of approximately $120 million of certain software development costs primarily associated with Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system. Headcount-related costs decreased 1% and increased 7% during the three and six months ended December 31, 2006, respectively, reflecting a 17% increase in headcount, an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, and offsetting impacts of 11 and six percentage points, respectively, resulting from the capitalization of certain software development costs.

Sales and marketing expenses increased during the three and six months ended December 31, 2006, primarily as a result of increased headcount-related costs and other marketing costs related to recent and upcoming product launches. Headcount-related costs increased 23% and 25% during the three and six months ended December 31, 2006, respectively, reflecting both an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 15% increase in headcount.

General and administrative costs increased during the three months ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related costs and increased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. General and administrative costs decreased during the six months ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflecting decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies partially offset by increased headcount-related costs. We incurred $111 million and $198 million in legal charges during the three and six months ended December 31, 2006, respectively, as compared to $66 million and $515 million in legal charges during the three and six months ended December 31, 2005, respectively. Legal costs during the first half of fiscal year 2006 included a $361 million charge related to our settlement with RealNetworks, Inc. Headcount-related costs increased 11% and 17%, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2006, reflecting both an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 15% increase in headcount.

For the three months and six months ended December 31, 2006, dividends and interest income declined, reflecting a decline in the average balance of dividend and interest-bearing investments, partly offset by higher interest rates received on our fixed-income investments. Net gains on sales of equity investments, net gains on sales of fixed-income investments, and other-than-temporary impairments on both equity and fixed-income investments comprise our net recognized gains on investments. Net recognized gains for the three months ended December 31, 2006, declined primarily due to fewer gains on the sale of equity investments in the current period as compared to the comparable period in the prior year. Other-than-temporary impairments in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 were not material and were $37 million in the comparable quarter of the prior fiscal year. Net recognized gains for the six months ended December 31, 2006, increased primarily due to gains on sales of fixed-income investments in the current period as compared to losses in the prior period, partly offset by fewer gains on the sale of equity investments in the current period as compared to the prior period. Net gains on investments for the six months ended December 31, 2006 included $15 million in other-than-temporary impairments in the current period as compared to $49 million in the comparable period of the prior fiscal year.
We use derivative instruments to manage exposures to interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency markets and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Net losses on derivatives were as follows:

During the three months ended December 31, 2006, we experienced fewer net losses on derivatives as compared the comparable period in the prior year primarily reflecting smaller losses on commodity and interest rate derivatives. Additionally, net losses in time value on foreign exchange contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues declined in the current period as compared to the prior period. During the six months ended December 31, 2006, net losses on derivatives were higher in the current year primarily due to losses on equity derivatives in the current period as compared to gains in the prior period.

Gains and losses arising from derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are economically offset by unrealized losses and gains, respectively, in the underlying securities which are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Commodity derivatives are held for the purpose of portfolio diversification. Net losses related to foreign currency contracts relate primarily to changes in time value of options used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues. Additionally, net gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts include the changes in the fair value of derivatives used as economic hedges. These gains and losses are partially offset economically by unrealized losses and gains, respectively, in the underlying assets which are included in other comprehensive income.
During the second quarter of the prior fiscal year, Microsoft and NBC Universal, Inc. entered into amended and restated agreements to restructure their joint venture relationships for MSNBC Cable L.L.C. (“CJV”) and MSNBC Interactive News, L.L.C. (“IJV”). Investment income and other for the prior year includes a net gain related to the restructuring of CJV and IJV.
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Collateral and/or security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. We anticipate that the magnitude of securities lent under this program will remain relatively consistent during the fiscal year.
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate was 31% for the three and six months ended December 31, 2006. Our effective tax rate for the three months and six months ended December 31, 2005 was 29% and 30%, respectively.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash and equivalents and short-term investments totaled $28.87 billion as of December 31, 2006, compared to $34.16 billion as of June 30, 2006. Equity and other investments were $9.63 billion as of December 31, 2006, compared to $9.23 billion as of June 30, 2006. The investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S.-dollar-denominated securities, but also includes foreign-denominated securities in order to diversify financial risk. The portfolio is primarily invested in short-term securities to facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs. As a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $24.52 billion at December 31, 2006. Our retained deficit is not expected to impact our future ability to operate or pay dividends given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the life cycle of the related product. Other unearned revenue includes services, TV platform, Microsoft Business Solutions, advertising, and subscriptions for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.

Table of Contents

Unearned revenue as of December 31, 2006 increased $1.8 billion from September 30, 2006, and $1.0 billion from June 30, 2006, primarily reflecting the $1.6 billion second quarter revenue deferral. The increase from June 30, 2006 was partially offset by the recognition of unearned revenue from multi-year licensing that exceeded deferrals by $0.7 billion.
The following table outlines the expected recognition of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2006:

Cash Flows
Cash flow from operations for the six months ended December 31, 2006 decreased $457 million from the first six months of fiscal year 2006 to $6.10 billion, due to increased payments for income taxes contributing to an $898 million increase in cash used for other current liabilities combined with cash used to fund other changes in working capital. These impacts were partially offset by a $1.27 billion increase in cash from deferred revenue due to increased billings in the six months ended December 31, 2006. Cash used for financing was $10.50 billion in the first half of fiscal year 2007, a decrease of $245 million from the corresponding period in fiscal year 2006. Several events occurred during the first half of fiscal year 2007 that affected cash used for financing. JPMorgan exercised approximately 113 million call options for $3.30 billion in December 2006 which was included in the $4.83 billion of common stock issued during the six months ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $3.37 billion from the same period in fiscal year 2006. We also completed our tender offer on August 17, 2006, which was included in the $13.48 billion of common stock repurchases in the six months ended December 31, 2006. Cash from investing was $4.50 billion in the first half of fiscal year 2007, an increase of $1.07 billion from the first half of fiscal year 2006, due to a $2.14 billion increase in net cash from combined investment purchases, sales, and maturities, partially offset by increased additions to property and equipment and a decline in our securities lending program in which we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns.
We have no material long-term borrowings. Stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2006, was $36.63 billion. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices. We have issued residual value guarantees in connection with various operating leases. These guarantees provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value. As of December 31, 2006, the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately $271 million. We believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability currently exists. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources.

On September 13, 2006, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share. The dividend was paid on December 14, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 16, 2006. On December 20, 2006, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share. The dividend is payable on March 8, 2007 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 15, 2007. This dividend of approximately $978 million was included in other current liabilities on our balance sheet. On September 23, 2005, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share. The dividend was paid on December 8, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 17, 2005. On December 14, 2005, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.09 per share. The dividend was paid on March 9, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 17, 2006.
On July 20, 2006, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized two new share repurchase programs: a $20 billion tender offer, which was completed on August 17, 2006; and authorization for up to an additional $20 billion ongoing share repurchase program with an expiration of June 30, 2011. Under the tender offer, we repurchased approximately 155 million shares of common stock, or 1.5% of our common shares outstanding, for approximately $3.8 billion at a price per share of $24.75. On August 18, 2006, we announced that the authorization for the $20 billion ongoing share repurchase program had been increased by approximately $16.2 billion. As a result, we are authorized to repurchase additional shares in an amount up to $36.2 billion through June 30, 2011. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $29.3 billion remained of the $36.2 billion approved repurchase amount.
We believe existing cash and equivalents and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations, should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, regular quarterly dividends, and planned share repurchases. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short-term investments, as well as equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.
Other Matters
During the quarter, we finalized a set of business and technical collaboration agreements with Novell, Inc. that are intended to provide greater interoperability between the two companies’ products. As part of these arrangements, each company also announced agreements to provide their respective customers with patent coverage for covered products. These agreements will be in place until at least 2012. The parties also provided releases to each other for prior patent infringement.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. We consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any material liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Current Year Misstatements. SAB No. 108 requires analysis of misstatements using both an income statement (rollover) approach and a balance sheet (iron curtain) approach in assessing materiality and provides for a one-time cumulative effect

Table of Contents

transition adjustment. SAB No. 108 is effective for our fiscal year 2007 annual financial statements. We are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of SAB No. 108 will have on our financial statements.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. This statement is effective for us beginning July 1, 2008. We are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on our financial statements.
In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 requires recognition of tax benefits that satisfy a greater than 50% probability threshold. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN No. 48 is effective for us beginning July 1, 2007. We are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of FIN No. 48 will have on our financial statements.
In June 2006, the FASB ratified the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) consensus on EITF Issue No. 06-2, “Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43”. EITF Issue No. 06-2 requires companies to accrue the costs of compensated absences under a sabbatical or similar benefit arrangement over the requisite service period. EITF Issue No. 06-2 is effective for us beginning July 1, 2007. The cumulative effect of the application of this consensus on prior period results should be recognized through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. Elective retrospective application is also permitted. We are currently evaluating the financial impact of this guidance and the method of adoption that will be used.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for stock-based compensation.
We account for the licensing of software in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (“SOP”) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. The application of SOP 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value exists for those elements. Customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. These elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, the fair value of which is recognized over the product’s estimated life cycle. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.
SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and SEC SAB 59, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic
 
27
Table of Contents

methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (July 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.
We account for research and development costs in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements, including SFAS No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, and SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS No. 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. This is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2007, we determined that technological feasibility was reached with Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system. Accordingly, we capitalized approximately $120 million of software development costs during the quarter. Previously, such costs were expensed. The amortization of these costs will be included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position, or our cash flows.
SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax
 
28
Table of Contents

returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 5.
We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted.

OVERVIEW
 
The following MD&A is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements (“Notes”).
 
We develop, manufacture, license, and support a wide range of software products for many computing devices. Our software products include operating systems for servers, PCs, and intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; information worker productivity applications; business solutions applications; and software development tools. We provide consulting and product support services, and we train and certify system integrators and developers. We sell the Xbox video game console and games, PC games, and PC peripherals. Online communication and information services are delivered through our MSN portals and channels around the world.
 
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Entertainment and Devices Division is particularly subject to seasonality as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, Entertainment and Devices has generated over 40% of its yearly segment revenues in our second fiscal quarter. We believe the seasonality of revenue is likely to continue in the future.

Our revenue increase for the three months ended September 30, 2006 was driven primarily by sales of Xbox 360, which was launched in November 2005, and increased licensing of SQL Server, Windows Server, and Visual Studio. Also contributing to the increase in revenue was growth in licensing of Windows Client operating systems as a result of overall growth in the PC market and increased licensing of Office. Based on our

preliminary estimates, total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew 8% to 10% from the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, driven by strong consumer demand in both emerging and mature markets. Overall server hardware shipments growth in the first quarter was consistent with our full year estimate of 10% to 12%.
 
For the three months ended September 30, 2006, operating income increased primarily reflecting the revenue increase and a $362 million decrease in costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. The increase in Entertainment and Devices revenue was partially offset by an increase in cost of revenue primarily related to the shift in product mix from the first generation Xbox to Xbox 360. Additionally, continued investments in our Online Services Business increased our cost of revenue in that segment. Finally, headcount-related costs and research and development expenses increased as we continue to invest in our new and upcoming offerings such as our Windows Live platform, Windows Vista, the 2007 Microsoft Office system, Unified Communications, and Zune, our upcoming digital music and entertainment device. Headcount-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, increased 21%, resulting from both an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 17% increase in headcount over the past 12 months.
 
For the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect revenue to grow at a higher rate than fiscal year 2006, mainly reflecting significant product launches in fiscal year 2007. In October 2006, we announced our Express Upgrade to Windows Vista and Microsoft Office Technology Guarantee programs which provide consumers who purchase current products during the holiday season with free or discounted rights to Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office System when those products become available. As a result, a material amount of revenue is expected to be deferred from the second quarter to the third quarter of fiscal year 2007. The amount to be deferred will depend on the level and timing of sales, and the product and channel mix. Because the programs are expected to conclude in the third quarter of fiscal year 2007, we do not expect the programs to adversely affect our fiscal year 2007 revenue.
 
We estimate worldwide PC shipments will continue to grow 8% to 10% and overall server hardware shipments will continue to grow 10% to 12% in fiscal year 2007.
 
We expect our operating income growth rate in fiscal year 2007 will lag behind our revenue growth rate. We expect our level of spending to increase in four key areas in fiscal year 2007: increased product costs associated with Xbox consoles; marketing and field sales spending including product launch costs; quickening the pace of development in growth areas such as business intelligence, security, management and unified communications (including through acquisitions); and increased costs to execute on our online services strategy. While these investments will translate into increased operating expenses, we believe they will help lay the groundwork for future growth and profitability.

Client consists of premium edition operating systems, including Windows XP Professional, Media Center Edition, Tablet PC Edition, and standard Windows operating systems, including Windows XP Home. Premium offerings are Windows operating systems sold at a premium above Windows XP Home. Client revenue growth correlates with the growth of purchases of PCs from OEMs that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for over 80% of total Client revenue.
 
Client revenue increased for the first quarter of fiscal year 2007, reflecting $118 million or 4% growth in OEM revenue driven by 11% growth in OEM license units from increased PC unit shipments and $24 million or 5% growth in revenue from commercial and retail licensing of Windows operating systems. The increase in revenue included the impact of a $45 million revenue deferral related to OEM license units sold during the quarter that will be eligible for Express Upgrade to Windows Vista. During the quarter, the mix of OEM Windows operating systems licensed with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total OEM Windows operating systems licensed (“OEM Premium Mix”) increased nine percentage points to 59% over the prior year driven by the continued demand for Windows Media Center Edition. The differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from year to year are affected by changes in the OEM Premium Mix, changes in the geographical mix, and the channel mix of products sold by large, multi-national OEMs versus those sold by local and regional system builders.
 
Client operating income increased for the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 reflecting the increase in revenue partially offset by an increase in headcount-related costs and research and development efforts – both increases were primarily associated with Windows Vista. Headcount-related costs increased 19%, reflecting both an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 14% increase in headcount.
 
For the remainder of fiscal year 2007, we expect revenue to grow reflecting improvement in the commercial and retail portion of the business due to our upcoming launch of Windows Vista. We expect revenue generated from OEMs to grow slower than the PC hardware market due to increased concentration among larger OEMs, consumer hardware shipments growing faster than business shipments, and relatively faster growth in emerging markets. While we expect Express Upgrade to Windows Vista will reduce our second quarter revenue, we do not expect our fiscal year 2007 revenue to be adversely affected. We expect PC shipments to grow 8% to 10% for fiscal year 2007. We believe that PC unit growth rates will be higher in the consumer segment than in the business segment and higher in emerging markets than in mature markets.

Server and Tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (“CAL”) for Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server and other server products. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier and Professional product support services, and Microsoft Consulting Services. Server and Tools concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. The segment uses multiple channels for licensing including pre-installed OEM versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. The licenses are sold both as one-time licenses and as multi-year volume licenses.
 
Server and Tools revenue increased $324 million or 19% for the three months ended September 30, 2006, reflecting growth in Server and Server applications revenue, including CAL revenue, and developer tools, training and certification revenue. This increase was primarily driven by increased revenue associated with SQL

Table of Contents

Server, Windows Server, and Visual Studio. SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio 2005 were launched in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 and produced revenue growth in these product lines. The results reflect broad adoption of Windows Server products, especially SQL Server, which grew over 30% for the quarter. Overall revenue growth was also driven by consulting, premier and professional product support services revenue growth of $48 million or 12%.
 
Server and Tools operating income increased during the three months ended September 30, 2006, primarily reflecting the increased revenue, partially offset by increased headcount-related costs and cost of revenue. Headcount-related costs increased 13%, reflecting both an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 13% increase in headcount. Cost of revenue increased $43 million or 9%, reflecting the growth in consulting services provided and an increase in headcount-related expenses.
 
We expect continued momentum from fiscal year 2006 product launches and the expansion of our products in security, management and overall Windows Server growth in fiscal year 2007. We continue to estimate that overall server hardware unit shipments will grow 10% to 12% in fiscal year 2007.

Online Services Business (“OSB”) includes personal communications services, such as e-mail and instant messaging, and online information offerings, such as MSN Search, and the MSN portals and channels around the world. OSB also provides a variety of online paid services in addition to MSN Internet Access and MSN Premium Web Services. Revenue is derived primarily from advertisers on MSN.com, from consumers and partners through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services, and from MSN narrowband Internet access subscribers. AdCenter – our internally developed advertising platform – now serves all paid search traffic on our online properties in the U.S. and in certain international markets. We continue to rollout adCenter around the world and believe it will enable us to increase both display and search advertising revenue by reducing our reliance on third parties for delivering ads. In September 2006, we announced the release of Live Search and of Live.com in 47 markets worldwide, and final availability of Live Local Search in the U.K. and the U.S.
 
OSB revenue decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2006, primarily reflecting a $43 million or 30% decline in access revenue, as subscribers continue to migrate to broadband or other competitively priced Internet service providers. This decrease was partially offset by increased advertising revenue, which grew $17 million or 5% to $374 million, due primarily to growth in display advertising for portals, channels, email, and messaging services. The increase in display revenue was partially offset by a decline in search revenue due to the ongoing transition to adCenter. At September 30, 2006, OSB had 1.9 million Internet access subscribers and 10.4 million total subscribers compared with 2.7 million Internet access subscribers and 9.4 million total subscribers at September 30, 2005. In addition, we estimate that OSB has over 263 million active Hotmail accounts and over 255 million active Messenger accounts.
 
OSB operating income decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2006, reflecting the decline in revenue, increased headcount-related costs primarily as a result of continued investments in Windows Live, adCenter, and other properties, and increased cost of revenue as a result of the build out of our data center infrastructure. Headcount-related costs increased 43%, reflecting both an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 40% increase in headcount.

For the remainder of fiscal year 2007, we expect increased growth in display advertising revenue as the portals, channels, and communications services continue to expand globally and the overall Internet advertising market continues to expand. Our search revenue is expected to grow in fiscal year 2007 as a result of continued ramp up of adCenter while revenue from narrowband Internet Access is expected to continue to decline.

Microsoft Business Division (“MBD”) consists of programs, servers, services, and solutions designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. MBD includes the Microsoft Office System, Microsoft Dynamics, and the Microsoft Partner Program. MBD also includes the Small and Mid-market Solutions & Partners (“SMS&P”) organization, which focuses on helping Microsoft, its customers, and industry partners in the small and mid-market customer segments. Our Office System products represent over 90% of Microsoft Business Division revenues and include Microsoft Office, Microsoft Exchange Server and CALs, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, Microsoft Office Communications Server, Sharepoint Portal Server and CALs, Microsoft LiveMeeting, and One Note. Revenue growth depends on the ability to add value to the core Office product set and expand our product offerings in other information worker and business solution areas such as document lifecycle management, collaboration, business intelligence, customer relationship management, and enterprise resource planning.
 
MBD revenue increased during the three months ended September 30, 2006, reflecting a $145 million or 5% revenue increase in non-OEM revenue, which includes volume licensing, retailed packaged products, and preinstalled versions of Office in Japan, while OEM revenue remained flat. The increase in non-OEM revenue reflects a 19% increase in Microsoft Dynamics customer billings.
 
MBD operating income remained flat during the three months ended September 30, 2006, reflecting the revenue growth which was offset by an increase in headcount-related costs and an increase in research and development expenses primarily related to the 2007 Microsoft Office System. Headcount related costs increased 18%, reflecting both an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and an 11% increase in headcount.
 
We expect continued revenue growth during fiscal year 2007 in both our non-OEM and OEM offerings due to the upcoming launch of the 2007 Microsoft Office System. While we expect the Microsoft Office Technology Guarantee program will reduce our second quarter revenue, we do not expect our fiscal year 2007 revenue to be adversely affected. We continue to develop plans to drive revenue growth in new areas such as unified communications and through our existing portfolio of Microsoft Dynamics products.

Table of Contents

television industry, and Mobile and Embedded devices (principally Windows Mobile software platform and Windows Embedded device operating system). The success of video game consoles is determined by console innovation, the portfolio of video game content for the console, online offerings, and the market share of the console. We believe that the functionality of the Xbox 360 console, games portfolio, and online offerings are well-positioned relative to forthcoming competitive consoles. We also believe launching in advance of competing consoles will provide a strategic advantage for the long-term success of Xbox 360.
 
EDD revenue increased during the three months ended September 30, 2006, primarily driven by Xbox 360 which was launched in November 2005. Xbox and PC game revenue increased $319 million or 107% due to higher console volumes and higher Xbox video game revenue driven by the launch and by more software title releases. We sold approximately 900,000 Xbox 360 consoles during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007. Revenue from consumer hardware and software and TV platforms increased $21 million or 11% due to the release of new consumer hardware products and deployments of MSTV products. Mobile and Embedded Devices revenue increased $42 million or 42% due to unit volume increases in all major product lines, especially Windows Mobile software sales and Windows Embedded operating systems. Increased revenue for Windows Mobile software was primarily driven by increased market demand for phone-enabled PDAs and Smartphones, partially offset by decreased volume shipments for standalone PDAs. The increase in Windows Embedded revenue was due to our operating system being included in new product designs for both new and existing customers.
 
EDD operating loss in first quarter of fiscal year 2007 decreased primarily reflecting the increase in revenue, partially offset by a $268 million increase in cost of revenue primarily related to Xbox 360, increased sales and marketing expenses related to recent and upcoming product launches including Xbox 360 and PC games, and increased development costs associated with new and upcoming products, including Zune. Headcount-related costs increased 18%, reflecting both an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and an 18% increase in headcount.
 
In fiscal year 2007, we expect revenue to increase due to the increased availability of Xbox 360 during the entire fiscal year, including the second holiday season after its launch. We expect to introduce Zune in fiscal year 2007. The availability of a commercial IPTV product is expected to drive growth in MSTV revenue across several geographies. Revenue from existing mobility and embedded devices is expected to increase due to unit volume increases of Windows Mobile software driven by increased market demand for phone-enabled devices and Windows Embedded operating systems.

During the three months ended September 30, 2006, we experienced net losses on derivatives as compared to net gains in the comparable period in the prior year primarily reflecting net losses on equity derivatives and commodity derivatives in the current period as compared to net gains in the prior period. Net losses in time value on foreign exchange contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues declined in the current period as compared to the prior period.
 
Gains and losses arising from derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are economically offset by unrealized losses and gains, respectively, in the underlying securities which are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Commodity derivatives are held for the purpose of portfolio diversification. Net losses related to foreign currency contracts relate primarily to changes in time value of options used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues. Additionally, net gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts include the changes in the fair value of derivatives used as economic hedges. These gains and losses are partially offset economically by unrealized losses and gains, respectively, in the underlying assets which are included in other comprehensive income.
 
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Collateral and/or security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. We anticipate that the magnitude of securities lent under this program will remain relatively consistent during the fiscal year.
 
Income Taxes
 
Our effective tax rate was 31% for the three months ended September 30, 2006, and 2005.
 
FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
Cash and equivalents and short-term investments totaled $31.83 billion as of September 30, 2006, compared to $34.16 billion as of June 30, 2006. Equity and other investments were $8.76 billion as of September 30, 2006, compared to $9.23 billion as of June 30, 2006. The investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S.-dollar-denominated securities, but also includes foreign-denominated securities in order to diversify financial risk. The portfolio is primarily invested in short-term securities to facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs. As a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $21.56 billion at September 30, 2006. Our retained deficit is not expected to impact our future ability to operate or pay dividends given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.
 
Unearned Revenue
 
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the life cycle of the related product. Other unearned revenue includes services, TV platform, Microsoft Business Solutions, advertising, and subscriptions for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.
 
Unearned revenue as of September 30, 2006, decreased $805 million from June 30, 2006, reflecting recognition of unearned revenue from multi-year licensing that outpaced deferrals by $785 million, a $54 million increase in revenue deferred for undelivered elements, and a $74 million decrease primarily in unearned revenue for services and subscription services.

Cash Flows
 
Cash flow from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2006, decreased $268 million from the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 to $4.06 billion, due to increased payments to fund a $1.04 billion increase in inventory and product costs related to Xbox 360 along with increased cash usage for other current liabilities. These impacts were partially offset by a $1.09 billion increase in cash inflow from collection of accounts receivable. Cash used for financing was $8.18 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007, an increase of $5.23 billion from the corresponding period in fiscal year 2006. The increase reflects the impact of our tender offer completed on August 17, 2006, which was included in the $7.68 billion of common stock repurchases in the three months ended September 30, 2006, compared with $3.12 billion in the prior year. Cash provided by investing was $6.46 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007, an increase of $9.72 billion from the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, primarily due to a $9.54 billion increase in net cash from combined investment purchases, sales, and maturities in anticipation of our tender offer and $528 million of net cash proceeds from our securities lending program in which we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns.
 
We have no material long-term borrowings. Stockholders’ equity at September 30, 2006, was $36.1 billion. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices. We have issued residual value guarantees in connection with various operating leases. These guarantees provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value. As of September 30, 2006, the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately $271 million. We believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability currently exists. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources.
 
On September 13, 2006, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share. The dividend is payable on December 14, 2006, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 16, 2006. The ex-dividend date is November 14, 2006. This dividend of approximately $983 million was included in other current liabilities on our balance sheet at September 30, 2006. On September 23, 2005, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share. The dividend of approximately $846 million was paid on December 8, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 17, 2005. The ex-dividend date was November 15, 2005.
 
On July 20, 2006, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized two new share repurchase programs: a $20 billion tender offer, which was completed on August 17, 2006; and authorization for up to an
 
23
Table of Contents

additional $20 billion ongoing share repurchase program with an expiration of June 30, 2011. Under the tender offer, we repurchased approximately 155 million shares of common stock, or 1.5% of our common shares outstanding, for approximately $3.8 billion at a price per share of $24.75. On August 18, 2006, we announced that the authorization for the $20 billion ongoing share repurchase program had been increased by approximately $16.2 billion. As a result, we are authorized to repurchase additional shares in an amount up to $36.2 billion through June 30, 2011. As of September 30, 2006, approximately $35.3 billion remained of the $36.2 billion approved repurchase amount.
 
We believe existing cash and equivalents and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations, should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, regular quarterly dividends, and planned share repurchases. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short-term investments, as well as equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
 
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. We consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any material liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements.
 
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
 
In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Current Year Misstatements. SAB No. 108 requires analysis of misstatements using both an income statement (rollover) approach and a balance sheet (iron curtain) approach in assessing materiality and provides for a one-time cumulative effect transition adjustment. SAB No. 108 is effective for our fiscal year 2007 annual financial statements. We are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of SAB No. 108 will have on our financial statements; the impact is not expected to be material.
 
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. This statement is effective for us beginning July 1, 2008. We are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on our financial statements.
 
In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 requires recognition of tax benefits that satisfy a greater than 50% probability threshold. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN No. 48 is effective for us beginning July 1, 2007. We are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of FIN No. 48 will have on our financial statements.

In June 2006, the FASB ratified the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) consensus on EITF Issue No. 06-2, “Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43”. EITF Issue No. 06-2 requires companies to accrue the costs of compensated absences under a sabbatical or similar benefit arrangement over the requisite service period. EITF Issue No. 06-2 is effective for us beginning July 1, 2007. The cumulative effect of the application of this consensus on prior period results should be recognized through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. Elective retrospective application is also permitted. We are currently evaluating the financial impact of this guidance and the method of adoption that will be used.
 
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for stock-based compensation.
 
We account for the licensing of software in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (“SOP”) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. The application of SOP 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value exists for those elements. Customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. These elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, the fair value of which is recognized over the product’s estimated life cycle. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.
 
SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and SEC SAB 59, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
 
SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (July 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This requires significant
 
25
Table of Contents

judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.
 
We account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including SFAS No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, and SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS No. 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established have not been material, and accordingly, we have expensed all research and development costs when incurred.
 
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations.
 
SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 5.
 
We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 
Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements
 
Certain statements in Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”), other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believes,” “project,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “strategy,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
 
OVERVIEW
 
The following MD&A is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. This MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements.
 
We develop, manufacture, license, and support a wide range of software products for many computing devices. Our software products include operating systems for servers, personal computers (“PCs”) and intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; information worker productivity applications; business solutions applications; and software development tools. We provide consulting and product support services and we train and certify system integrators and developers. We sell the Xbox video game console and games, PC games, and PC peripherals. We deliver online communication and information services through our MSN portals and channels around the world.
 
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has been highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year, generally due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Home and Entertainment segment is particularly subject to seasonality as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Historically, Home and Entertainment revenue generated in our second fiscal quarter has comprised over 40% of yearly segment revenues, and we believe the seasonality of revenue is likely to continue in the future, however we expect the percentage to vary due to the launch of Xbox 360 in fiscal year 2006.
 
We intend to sustain the long-term growth of our businesses through technological innovation, engineering excellence, and a commitment to delivering high-quality products and services to customers and partners. Recognizing that one of our primary challenges is to help accelerate worldwide PC adoption and software upgrades, we continue to advance the functionality, security, and value of Windows operating systems, including versions for new devices such as Tablet PCs, Media Center PCs, Portable Media Centers, and mobile devices such as Smartphones. We are increasing our focus on emerging markets and reducing the amount of unlicensed software in those markets. In addition, we develop innovative software applications and solutions to enhance the productivity of information workers, improve communication and collaboration in work groups, aid business intelligence, and streamline processes for small and mid-sized businesses. To sustain the growth of our Server and Tools business amid competition from other vendors of both proprietary and open source software, our goal is to deliver products that provide the best platform for network computing — the most advanced, easiest to deploy and manage, and most secure, with the lowest total cost of ownership.

Worldwide macroeconomic factors have a strong correlation to business and consumer demand for our software, services, games, and Internet service offerings. We continue to expect that general macroeconomic conditions will remain stable in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006.

Our revenue increase for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006 was driven primarily by the second quarter launch of Xbox 360, increased licensing of Windows Server operating systems, SQL Server, and other server applications, growth in licensing of Windows Client operating systems through original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), and increased licensing of Office and other Information Worker products. Based on our preliminary estimates, total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew 12% to 13% from the third quarter of the previous year and 14% to 15% from the first nine months of the previous year, driven by strong consumer demand in both emerging and mature markets. Overall server hardware shipments growth in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2006 was consistent with our previous full year estimate of 11% to 13%. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $112 million or 1 percentage point decrease in revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2006 and had an insignificant impact on revenue for the nine months ended March 31, 2006.
 
For the three months ended March 31, 2006, operating income increased primarily reflecting the revenue increase and a $438 million decrease in costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. These changes were partially offset by a $665 million increase in cost of revenue primarily as a result of Xbox 360 and a $292 million increase in sales and marketing expenses as a result of product launch-related spending and Windows Vista pre-launch advertising and marketing programs. For the nine months ended March 31, 2006, operating income increased primarily reflecting increased Server and Tools and Client revenue, which have higher gross margins, and reflecting a $612 million decrease in costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. These changes were partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses related to the upcoming product launch of Windows Vista and recently completed product launches of SQL Server 2005, Visual Studio 2005, and Xbox 360, and increased product costs associated with Xbox 360. Headcount-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, increased $189 million and $422 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006, resulting from both an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 15% increase in headcount over the past twelve months. Stock-based compensation expense decreased $243 million and $561 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006 reflecting a continuing decline in stock option amortization expense. We expect this trend to continue in the remainder of fiscal year 2006 and into fiscal year 2007.
 
We expect revenue to grow at a faster rate during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 than the fourth quarter or fiscal year 2005, mainly reflecting significant product launches in fiscal year 2006. We estimate worldwide PC shipments will grow 12% to 14% and overall server hardware shipments will also grow 11% to 13% in fiscal year 2006.
 
We expect our operating income growth rate in the fourth quarter to exceed our revenue growth rate. Operating income is expected to reflect lower costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies than in fiscal year 2005. This is expected to be partially offset by the increase in expenses associated with recently launched products and upcoming products and investments.

SEGMENT PRODUCT REVENUE/OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)
 
Our seven segments currently are Client; Server and Tools; Information Worker; Microsoft Business Solutions; MSN; Mobile and Embedded Devices; and Home and Entertainment.
 
In order to execute our software and services strategy with greater agility, we previously announced a plan to reorganize the company into three operating divisions – Microsoft Platform Products and Services Division, Microsoft Business Division, and Microsoft Entertainment and Devices Division. The new Microsoft Platform Products and Services Division is comprised of Client, Server and Tools, and MSN. The Information Worker business and Microsoft Business Solutions combined to form the Microsoft Business Division. The new Microsoft Entertainment and Devices Division brought together Home and Entertainment and Mobile and Embedded Devices. We expect to complete any changes in internal financial management and reporting as a result of the reorganization by the beginning of fiscal year 2007. The impact on reporting segments, if any, will be reflected at that time. In the interim, we continue to organize, manage, and report the business through the seven segments.
 
Revenue and operating income/(loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. Segment information appearing in Note 9 – Segment Information of the Notes to Financial Statements is presented on a basis consistent with the Company’s current internal management reporting, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Certain corporate level expenses have been excluded from our segment operating results and are analyzed separately. Prior amounts have been restated for certain internal reorganizations and to conform to the current period presentation. Headcount expenses related to cost of revenue are not included in the discussion of headcount-related costs in this section.

Client consists of premium edition operating systems, including Windows XP Professional, Media Center Edition, Tablet PC Edition, and other standard Windows operating systems, including Windows XP Home. Premium offerings are Windows operating systems sold at a premium above Windows XP Home. Client revenue growth correlates with the growth of purchases of PCs from OEMs that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for over 80% of total Client revenue.
 
Client revenue increased during the third quarter of fiscal year 2006 reflecting $254 million or 10% growth in OEM revenue driven by 16% growth in OEM license units from increased PC unit shipments, partially offset by a $31 million or 6% decrease in revenue from commercial and retail licensing of Windows operating systems. This decrease in commercial and retail licensing reflects our customers’ continued preference for acquiring the next version of their operating system through the OEM channel when they replace their PC hardware, rather than purchasing a multi-year licensing agreement or purchasing at retail. The difference between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from quarter to quarter is driven by the channel mix of products sold by large, multinational OEMs versus those sold by local and regional system builders, the mix of premium versions of operating systems licensed during the quarter, and changes in geographical mix. The mix of OEM Windows premium edition operating systems licensed as a percentage of total OEM Windows operating systems licensed increased four percentage points to 53% of total OEM Windows operating systems for the three months ended March 31, 2006 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2005. This OEM premium mix reflects the
 
21
Table of Contents

effects of an increase in the mix of Windows XP Media Center Edition licenses offset by a decrease in the mix of Windows XP Professional licenses which are generally sold at a higher price point. Client revenue increased in the nine months ended March 31, 2006 reflecting Windows OEM license unit growth of 16%, which drove an $846 million or 11% increase in OEM revenue compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, which was partially offset by a $150 million or 10% decline in commercial and retail licensing revenue.
 
Client operating income increased during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006 primarily reflecting the increase in OEM revenue partially offset by a $68 million increase in the third quarter and a $225 million increase in the first nine months in sales and marketing expenses, excluding headcount-related costs, mainly driven by increased investments in partner marketing and Windows Vista pre-launch programs. Headcount-related costs increased 6% and 5%, respectively, in the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006 reflecting both an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 14% increase in headcount primarily associated with Windows Vista and further investments in our sales and marketing organization, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
 
We anticipate that total PC shipments will grow approximately 10% to 11% in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, and will continue to be the primary factor influencing growth in Client revenue. In addition, we estimate that increasing shipments of laptops as a percentage of total PC systems will continue to positively influence Client revenue growth due to the shorter replacement cycles for laptops compared to desktop PCs. The time between operating system releases, and the prospective launch of our Windows Vista operating system in fiscal year 2007, may impact our ability to close on some multi-year licensing agreements. We expect emerging markets to continue to outpace mature market growth rates. Piracy continues to be a challenge in both emerging and mature markets. We are focusing on growing OEM licenses faster than the overall market by driving for gains against piracy through initiatives such as Windows Genuine Advantage and through joint programs with channel partners. Client commercial and retail licensing revenues are expected to continue to lag behind overall Client revenue growth. We plan to continue our efforts to increase premium product mix. We anticipate shipments of the premium-priced Windows XP Media Center Edition will continue to grow as a percentage of total operating systems shipped. We expect Client operating expenses to increase during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 due to continued investment in headcount related to development of Windows Vista and increases in joint marketing programs with our OEM partners.

Server and Tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (“CALs”) for Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Exchange Server, and other server products. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier and Professional product support services, and Microsoft Consulting Services. Server and Tools concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content, and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. The segment uses multiple channels for licensing including pre-installed OEM versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. The licenses are sold both as one-time licenses and as multi-year volume licenses. Server and Tools uses product innovation and partnerships with information technology professionals to drive the adoption and sales growth of its products.
 
Server and Tools revenue increased during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006 mainly driven by growth in Windows Server licensing and strength of SQL Server 2005 following its launch in the second

quarter of this fiscal year. Server and Server application revenue, including CAL revenue, grew $347 million or 17% during the third quarter and $875 million or 14% during the first nine months of fiscal year 2006. The results reflect broad adoption of Windows Server System products, especially SQL Server, which grew over 30% for the quarter and 25% year to date. Consulting and Premier and Professional product support services revenue increased $39 million or 10% in the third quarter and $166 million or 15% in the first nine months of fiscal year 2006. Included in the amounts above are changes in foreign currency exchange rates which accounted for a $31 million or one percentage point decrease in revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2006 and had an insignificant impact on revenue for the nine months ended March 31, 2006.
 
Server and Tools operating income increased during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006 primarily reflecting increased revenue, partially offset by increased sales and marketing costs. Sales and marketing costs, excluding headcount-related costs, increased $56 million and $253 million, respectively, in the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006 primarily due to marketing expenses related to the launch of SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio 2005 and expenses to support long term business strategies. Headcount-related costs increased 6% and 5%, respectively, in the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006 reflecting both an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 13% increase in headcount partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
 
We continue to expect overall server hardware shipments to grow approximately 11% to 13% in fiscal year 2006. However, we face strong competition from Linux-based, Unix, and other server operating systems as well as competition in server applications. We also expect Server and Tools operating expenses to increase during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 due to continued investment in headcount.

Information Worker consists of the Microsoft Office system of programs, servers, services, and solutions designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. Information Worker includes Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, SharePoint Portal Server CALs, and other information worker products including Microsoft LiveMeeting and OneNote. Our Office system offerings generate over 85% of Information Worker revenue. Revenue growth depends on the ability to add value to the core Office product set and expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as document lifecycle management, collaboration, and business intelligence.
 
Information Worker revenue increased during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006 primarily reflecting growth in volume licensing, retail packaged products, and preinstalled versions of Office in Japan of $124 million or 5% and $377 million or 5%, respectively. OEM revenue increased 4% and 2%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006. Included in the amounts above are changes in foreign currency exchange rates which contributed a $37 million or one percentage point decrease in revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2006 and had an insignificant impact on revenue for the nine months ended March 31, 2006.
 
Information Worker operating income increased during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006 reflecting the revenue growth, partially offset by a $38 million and $193 million, respectively, increase in sales and marketing costs, excluding headcount-related costs. This increase in sales and marketing costs reflects increased field sales activities, advertising and product launch preparation costs. Headcount-related costs increased 19% and 14%, respectively, during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006 reflecting both an

increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 19% increase in headcount related to supporting field sales efforts and research and development investments in future products, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
 
We expect sustained momentum during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 in our multi-year licensing offerings and increased sales of Office 2003. We continue to develop plans to drive revenue growth in new areas such as the Office Live™ web-based services offering; however, we do not anticipate a significant impact on overall revenue from these areas until future fiscal years. We also expect Information Worker operating expenses to increase during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 due to continued investment in headcount in both research and development and the field sales force.

Microsoft Business Solutions provides business management software solutions targeted to businesses of varying sizes. The main products consist of enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) solutions, customer relationship management (“CRM”) software, retail solutions, Microsoft Partner Program and related services. Microsoft Business Solutions also includes the Small and Mid-market Solutions & Partners organization, which focuses on sales to customers and partners in the small and mid-market customer segments. Revenue is derived from software and services sales, with software sales representing a large majority of total revenue. Software revenues include both new software licenses and enhancement plans, which provide customers with future software upgrades over the period of the plan. Our solutions are delivered through a worldwide network of channel partners that provide services and local support.
 
Microsoft Business Solutions revenue increased during the three months ended March 31, 2006 reflecting 28% growth in license revenue, primarily in the Dynamics ERP product lines, and 13% growth in enhancement plan revenue, while services revenue increased 15%. For the first nine months of fiscal year 2006, the 18% revenue increase was primarily due to 20% growth in license revenue and 17% growth in enhancement plan revenue from our Dynamics ERP and CRM solutions, while services revenue increased approximately 7%.
 
Microsoft Business Solutions operating loss decreased for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006 reflecting the increase in revenue partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing expense. The increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to additional marketing spend as we continue to invest in demand creation and channel development. Headcount-related costs increased 2% and 3%, respectively, in the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006 reflecting both an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 10% increase in headcount partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
 
We expect continued revenue growth through the Microsoft Business Solutions portfolio of business solutions through the end of the year. Continued investments in the next generation of solutions, broader geographical coverage, and plans to facilitate our partners providing customized vertical solutions are expected to result in continued reduction in the Microsoft Business Solutions operating loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 and into fiscal year 2007.

MSN includes personal communications services, such as e-mail and instant messaging, and online information offerings such as MSN Search, MapPoint, and the MSN portals and channels around the world. MSN also provides a variety of online paid services in addition to MSN Internet Access and MSN Premium Web Services. Revenue is derived primarily from advertisers on MSN, from consumers and partners through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services, and from subscribers to MSN Narrowband Internet Access. We launched MSN adCenter – our internally developed advertising platform – in certain international markets in the first half of fiscal year 2006, and are currently testing this new platform in the United States. We believe MSN adCenter will enable us to increase both display and search advertising revenues by reducing our reliance on third parties for delivering ads. Effective July 1, 2005, functions related to MapPoint previously reported in Mobile and Embedded Devices were moved to MSN. Mobile and Embedded Devices and MSN operating results for the prior periods have been restated for this reorganization. In November 2005, Microsoft announced Windows Live™, which is a set of Internet services and software designed to bring together user relationships, information, and interests, with enhanced safety and security across PCs, devices, and the Web. Some Windows Live™ services entered an early beta phase in the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2006.
 
MSN revenue decreased during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006 primarily due to a decline of $53 million or 31% in Internet Access revenue for the third quarter and $182 million or 31% for the first nine months ended March 31, 2006. Internet Access revenue decreased as subscribers decreased to 2.3 million at March 31, 2006 from 3.0 million at March 31, 2005 reflecting the continued migration to broadband or other competitively priced Internet service providers. Revenue from subscriptions and transactions services other than Internet Access increased $8 million or 13% in the third quarter and $29 million or 16% in the nine months ended March 31, 2006. As of March 31, 2006, MSN had approximately 241 million active Hotmail accounts and approximately 230 million active Messenger accounts, as compared to 200 million and 165 million at March 31, 2005. In addition, at March 31, 2006, MSN had 10.1 million total subscribers compared to 9.1 million at the end of the third quarter of the prior year. Advertising revenue increased $25 million or 7% in the third quarter and $125 million or 13% in the nine months ended March 31, 2006 due primarily to growth in display advertising for portals, channels, email, and messaging services, which was partially offset by a decline in both periods in search revenue due to the ramp up of adCenter.
 
MSN operating income decreased during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006 primarily reflecting the decline in revenue and an increase in research and development costs as we continue to invest in MSN adCenter and other new platforms. Headcount-related costs increased 27% and 18%, respectively, during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006 reflecting both an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 35% increase in headcount partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
 
MSN expects increased growth in display advertising revenue as the portals, channels, and communications services continue to expand globally and the overall Internet advertising industry continues to expand. However, we expect overall advertising growth to continue to be tempered by the launch and ramp-up of adCenter and the related pressure on our search advertising prices. We expect revenue from narrowband Internet Access to continue to decline in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006. The profitability decline experienced in the third quarter of fiscal year 2006 will likely continue for the remainder of fiscal year 2006 as investments are made in the development of new applications and services, Search and adCenter, and expanding the field sales force. In addition, MSN may make investments in improving the user experience and in some cases reducing the number

of advertisements delivered either via our search tools or via our Internet portals, thereby helping to sustain and grow our user base.

Mobile and Embedded Devices includes Windows Mobile software, Windows Embedded operating systems, and Windows Automotive. These products extend the advantages of the Windows platform to mobile devices such as PDAs, phones, and a wide range of embedded devices. The business is also responsible for managing sales and customer relationships for Microsoft overall with device manufacturers and communication sector customers. The communication sector includes network service providers (such as wireless, wireline and cable operators) and media and entertainment companies. The market for products in these segments is intensely competitive. Competitive alternatives vary based on product lines and include product offerings from commercial and non-commercial mobile operating system providers, and proprietary software developed by OEMs and mobile operators. Short product life cycles in product lines such as Windows Mobile software may impact our continuing revenue streams. Effective July 1, 2005, functions related to MapPoint previously reported in Mobile and Embedded Devices have been moved to MSN. Mobile and Embedded Devices and MSN operating results for the prior periods have been restated for this reorganization.
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices revenue grew during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006 primarily reflecting unit volume increases in all major product lines, especially Windows Mobile software sales and Windows Embedded operating systems. Windows Mobile software revenue increased reflecting increased market demand for cellular connected mobile devices such as phone-enabled PDAs and Smartphones, partially offset by a reduction in unit shipments for stand-alone PDAs. Revenue for Windows Mobile software increased $17 million or 52% and revenue for Windows Embedded operating systems increased $9 million or 35% for the three months ended March 31, 2006. Revenue for Windows Mobile software increased $39 million or 37% and revenue for Windows Embedded operating systems increased $37 million or 51% compared to the first nine months of the prior year.
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices operating income decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2006 primarily reflecting increased costs for marketing and product development. For the nine months ended March 31, 2006, operating income increased due to increased revenue partially offset by an increase in headcount-related costs. Headcount-related costs increased 15% and 12%, respectively, during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006 reflecting both an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 25% increase in headcount partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
 
We expect revenue for Mobile and Embedded Devices to continue to grow in the remainder of fiscal year 2006 driven by an overall increase in customer demand for connectivity, and an increase in the number of new devices incorporating Windows Mobile software and new devices being offered by OEMs incorporating Windows Embedded operating systems. We also expect Mobile and Embedded Devices operating expenses to continue to increase during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 due to continued investment in headcount, marketing and product development.

Home and Entertainment includes the Microsoft Xbox video game console system, PC games, the Home Products Division, and TV platform products for the interactive television industry. The success of video game consoles is determined by console functionality, the portfolio of video game content for the console, online services, and the market share of the console. Our Xbox business is transitioning to a new console, the Xbox 360, which launched in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006. We believe that the functionality of our new console, portfolio of games, and online services are well-positioned relative to forthcoming competitive consoles. We also believe launching in advance of competitive consoles will provide a strategic advantage for the long-term success of Xbox 360. Revenue from the first generation of Xbox products has declined and is expected to continue to decline as a result of the introduction of Xbox 360.
 
Home and Entertainment revenue increased during the third quarter of fiscal year 2006 primarily reflecting an increase in Xbox revenue of $475 million or 133%. Xbox revenue increased mainly due to the shipment of 1.75 million Xbox 360 consoles, which exceeded the number of first generation consoles sold in the prior year. In addition, Xbox 360 consoles sell at a higher average price than first generation consoles. Home and Entertainment revenue increased for the first nine months of fiscal year 2006 driven by the launch of Xbox 360 and the strength of new PC games, especially “Age of Empires III”. Revenue from the 3.25 million Xbox 360 consoles shipped since its launch more than offset the approximate $300 million impact of Halo2 sales in fiscal year 2005.
 
Home and Entertainment operating loss in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2006 increased primarily due to an increase in product costs and sales and marketing expenses related to the Xbox 360 and due to the significant margin generated by Halo2 in fiscal year 2005. Our business model anticipates that while we currently sell Xbox 360 consoles at a negative margin, product cost reductions and the future margins on sales of games and other products will enable us to achieve a positive margin over the Xbox 360 console lifecycle. The first generation Xbox consoles continue to have negative margins. Headcount-related costs increased 5% and 3%, respectively, in the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006 reflecting both an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 14% increase in headcount partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
 
In fiscal year 2006, we expect Xbox console unit volumes and revenue to increase from fiscal year 2005 due to the launch of Xbox 360. In fiscal year 2006, we expect PC games revenue to increase from fiscal year 2005 driven by the availability of more new game titles. We expect operating expenses and operating loss to increase as a result of Xbox 360 launch-related activities and Xbox 360 console costs. Revenue from the previous generation of Xbox products decreased and is expected to continue to decrease due to the launch of Xbox 360.

Corporate-level expenses in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2006 decreased primarily due to a decrease in charges for legal settlements and legal contingencies offset by increased information technology costs. Legal charges decreased $438 million and $612 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2006, we incurred $397 million in legal charges related primarily to antitrust and unfair competition consumer class actions, intellectual property claims, and an extension payment to Sun Microsystems, Inc. under our existing Limited Patent Covenant and Standstill Agreement, as compared to $835 million in legal charges in the prior year related primarily to settlements with Gateway, Inc. and Burst.com, an extension payment to Sun Microsystems, and $550 million in charges related to antitrust and other matters. We incurred $913 million in legal charges primarily related to our settlement with RealNetworks, Inc. as well as other intellectual property and antitrust matters during the nine months ended March 31, 2006, as compared to approximately $1.5 billion of legal charges in the prior year primarily related to settlements with Novell, Inc. and Gateway and other antitrust matters. Headcount-related costs increased 5% and 3%, respectively, during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006 reflecting both an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 21% increase in headcount partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.

Cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed, operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, and costs associated with the delivery of consulting services. Cost of revenue increased mainly due to a $658 million and $957 million increase in Home and Entertainment in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2006 as a result of an increase in the number of total Xbox consoles and higher Xbox 360 unit costs. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in product support and consulting services costs.

Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Research and development costs increased during the three months and nine months ended March 31, 2006 primarily due to increased product development costs associated with new and upcoming products such as Windows Vista, MSN adCenter, the Microsoft Office 2007 system, and corporate research activities.

Legal charges decreased $438 million and $612 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2006, we incurred $397 million in legal charges related primarily to antitrust and unfair competition consumer class actions, intellectual property claims, and an extension payment to Sun Microsystems, Inc. under our existing Limited Patent Covenant and Standstill Agreement, as compared to $835 million in legal charges in the prior year related primarily to settlements with Gateway, Inc. and Burst.com, an extension payment to Sun Microsystems, and $550 million in charges related to antitrust and other matters. We incurred $913 million in legal charges primarily related to our settlement with RealNetworks, Inc. as well as other intellectual property and antitrust matters during the nine months ended March 31, 2006, as compared to approximately $1.5 billion of legal charges in the prior year primarily related to settlements with Novell, Inc. and Gateway and other antitrust matters. Headcount-related costs increased 7% and 6%, respectively, during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006 reflecting both an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 17% increase in headcount partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.

For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006 dividends and interest income increased due to higher interest rates received on our fixed income investments. For the nine months ended March 31, 2006 the dividends and interest income increase was partially offset by a decline in the average balance of dividend and interest-bearing investments as a result of the $32.64 billion special dividend paid on December 2, 2004 and stock repurchases.
 
For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006, net recognized gains on investments were comprised of net gains on sales of equity investments, net losses on sales of fixed income investments and other-than-temporary impairments on both equity and fixed income investments. Net recognized gains decreased for both the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006 primarily due to increased losses on sales of fixed income investments. This was partially offset by a decrease in other-than-temporary impairments in the three-month period and an increase in net gains on equity investments in the nine-month period. For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006, other-than-temporary impairments were $42 million and $91 million, respectively, as compared to $93 million and $132 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2005. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary.
 
We use derivative instruments to manage exposures to interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency markets and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Net gains/(losses) on derivatives are as follows:

During the three months ended March 31, 2006, we experienced losses on derivatives as compared to gains in the comparable period in the prior year primarily reflecting net losses in time value on foreign exchange contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues and lower net gains on commodity positions.

Table of Contents

During the nine months ended March 31, 2006, we experienced net gains related to equity derivatives as compared to net losses in the prior year, primarily reflecting net gains on non-designated derivatives used to economically hedge against declines in equity prices, partly offset by an increase in losses on foreign exchange contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues.
 
The gains and losses arising from non-designated derivatives are economically offset by unrealized losses and gains, respectively, in the underlying equity securities which are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Commodity derivatives are held for the purpose of portfolio diversification. Net losses related to foreign currency contracts relate primarily to changes in time value of options used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues. Additionally, net gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts include the changes in the fair value of derivatives used as economic hedges. These gains and losses are partially offset economically by unrealized losses and gains, respectively, in the underlying assets which are included in other comprehensive income.
 
In the second quarter of fiscal year 2006, Microsoft and NBC Universal, Inc. (“NBC”) entered into an agreement that restructured their joint venture relationships for MSNBC Cable L.L.C. (“CJV”) and MSNBC Interactive News, L.L.C. (“IJV”). As a result, Microsoft divested 32% of CJV for $331 million and NBC acquired the right, exercisable in the following two years, to buy the remaining 18% interest. In addition, Microsoft and NBC modified their agreements to grant to IJV a U.S. content license and to remove the exclusivity obligation on both NBC and Microsoft for local and non-U.S. news content. As part of the MSNBC restructuring agreements, Microsoft paid a fee of $200 million to effectively terminate IJV’s prior content license agreement and Microsoft prepaid the remaining $14 million license fee to NBC. Microsoft’s sale of its 32% investment in CJV resulted in a recognized gain of $248 million. Microsoft also recognized a loss as a result of the effective termination of IJV’s license agreement of $200 million. For the nine months ended March 31, 2006 income from equity investees and other includes a net gain of $48 million related to the restructuring of CJV and IJV.
 
Income Taxes
 
Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2006 was 31% and 30%, respectively. We expect to have an effective tax rate of 31% for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006. Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2005 was 33%. The decline in the tax rate reflected an increase in earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions and by $108 million of benefits from state audit settlements.
 
FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
Cash and equivalents and short-term investments totaled $34.82 billion as of March 31, 2006, compared to $37.75 billion as of June 30, 2005. Equity and other investments were $8.89 billion as of March 31, 2006, compared to $11.00 billion as of June 30, 2005. The investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S.-dollar-denominated securities, but also includes foreign currency positions in order to diversify financial risk. The portfolio is primarily invested in short-term securities to facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs. As a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $17.81 billion at March 31, 2006. Our retained deficit is not expected to impact our future ability to operate or pay dividends given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.
 
Unearned Revenue
 
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue
 
31
Table of Contents

recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the life cycle of the related product. Other unearned revenue includes Services, TV Platform, Microsoft Business Solutions, and advertising and subscription services in which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.
 
Unearned revenue as of March 31, 2006 decreased $266 million from June 30, 2005, reflecting recognition of unearned revenue from multi-year licensing that outpaced additions by $257 million and a $9 million decrease in revenue deferred for undelivered elements. Unearned revenue as of March 31, 2006 increased $63 million from December 31, 2005, reflecting recognition of unearned revenue from multi-year licensing that outpaced additions by $7 million, a $15 million decrease in revenue deferred for undelivered elements, and an $85 million increase primarily in unearned revenue for Services and subscription services.

Cash Flows
 
Cash flow from operations for the nine months ended March 31, 2006 decreased $1.51 billion from the first nine months of fiscal year 2005 to $11.12 billion, reflecting an increase in Xbox 360 inventory, payment of current liabilities, and other changes in working capital. Cash used for financing was $15.88 billion in the first nine months of fiscal year 2006, a decrease of $21.49 billion from the corresponding period in fiscal year 2005. The decrease is primarily due to the $32.63 billion decrease in dividends paid due to the special dividend in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005, partially offset by an $11.48 billion increase in common stock repurchases. Included in repurchases are approximately 561 million shares repurchased for $15.12 billion during the nine months ended March 31, 2006 as compared to 141.5 million shares repurchased for $3.70 billion during the nine months ended March 31, 2005. Cash from investing was $4.26 billion in the first nine months of fiscal year 2006, a decrease of $9.90 billion from the first nine months of fiscal year 2005, reflecting a $10.64 billion decrease in net cash from combined investment purchases, sales, and maturities in preparation for the special dividend paid in the second quarter of the prior year partially offset by a cash inflow of $1.34 billion from securities lending in the third quarter of fiscal year 2006.
 
We have no material long-term debt. Stockholders’ equity at March 31, 2006 was $42.04 billion. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices. We have issued residual value guarantees in connection
 
32
Table of Contents

with various operating leases. These guarantees provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value. As of March 31, 2006, the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately $271 million. We believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability currently exists. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources.
 
On March 27, 2006, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.09 per share. The dividend is payable on June 8, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 17, 2006. The ex-dividend date is May 15, 2006. On December 14, 2005, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.09 per share. The dividend was paid on March 9, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 17, 2006. The ex-dividend date was February 15, 2006. On September 23, 2005, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share. The dividend was paid on December 8, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 17, 2005. The ex-dividend date was November 15, 2005.
 
On October 26, 2005, our Board of Directors approved a modification to the July 20, 2004 share repurchase plan. The original repurchase plan called for up to $30 billion of Microsoft common stock to be repurchased over the succeeding four years. Under the revised plan, we expect to complete the $30 billion approved repurchase amount no later than December 2006. As of March 31, 2006, approximately $6.4 billion remained of the $30 billion approved repurchase amount. The specific timing and amount of repurchases will vary based upon market conditions, securities laws limitations, and other factors. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.
 
We believe existing cash and equivalents and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations, should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, regular quarterly dividends, and planned share repurchases. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short-term investments, as well as equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.
 
Off-balance sheet arrangements
 
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. We consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any material liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements.
 
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
 
Prior to July 1, 2005, we accounted for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based awards was measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and was recognized as expense over the service period for awards that were expected to vest.
 
33
Table of Contents

Effective July 1, 2005, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, using the modified prospective application transition method. Because the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 123(R) were materially consistent under our equity plans, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) did not have a significant impact on our financial position or our results of operations. Prior to our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs were reported as operating cash flows. SFAS No. 123(R) requires excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid. As of March 31, 2006, there was $1.7 billion and $417 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to SAs and SPSAs, respectively. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.6 and 2.4 years, respectively. As of March 31, 2006, there was $559 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock options. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of one year.
 
In November 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position (“FSP”) FAS123(R)-3, Transition Election to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards. This FSP requires an entity to follow either the transition guidance for the additional-paid-in-capital pool as prescribed in SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, or the alternative transition method as described in the FSP. An entity that adopts SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective application may make a one-time election to adopt the transition method described in this FSP. An entity may take up to one year from the later of its initial adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) or the effective date of this FSP to evaluate its available transition alternatives and make its one-time election. This FSP became effective in November 2005. We continue to evaluate the impact that the adoption of this FSP could have on our financial statements.
 
In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS115-1/124-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, which addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether that impairment is other than temporary, and the measurement of an impairment loss. This FSP also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. The guidance in this FSP amends FASB Statements No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and No. 124, Accounting for Certain Investments Held by Not-for-Profit Organizations, and APB Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. We adopted this FSP during the three months ended March 31, 2006 and it did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
 
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for stock-based compensation.
 
We account for the licensing of software in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (“SOP”) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. The application of SOP 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value exists for those elements. Customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. These elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, the fair value of which is recognized over the product’s estimated life cycle. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the
 
34
Table of Contents

amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.
 
SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and Staff Accounting Bulletin 59, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than- temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
 
SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (July 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our businesses, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.
 
We account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including SFAS No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, and SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS No. 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material, and accordingly, we expense all research and development costs when incurred.
 
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS No. 5 requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations.
 
SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes
 
35
Table of Contents

payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, our results of operations, or our cash flows.
 
We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted.

Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements
 
Certain statements in Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”), other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believes,” “project,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “strategy,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
 
OVERVIEW
 
The following MD&A is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. This MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements.
 
We develop, manufacture, license, and support a wide range of software products for many computing devices. Our software products include operating systems for servers, personal computers (“PCs”) and intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; information worker productivity applications; business solutions applications; and software development tools. We provide consulting and product support services and we train and certify system integrators and developers. We sell the Xbox video game console and games, PC games, and PC peripherals. Online communication and information services are delivered through our MSN portals and channels around the world.
 
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has been highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year, generally due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Home and Entertainment segment is particularly subject to seasonality as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Approximately 40% to 50% of Home and Entertainment revenue is generated in our second fiscal quarter and we believe the seasonality of revenue is likely to continue in the future.
 
We intend to sustain the long-term growth of our businesses through technological innovation, engineering excellence, and a commitment to delivering high-quality products and services to customers and partners. Recognizing that one of our primary challenges is to help accelerate worldwide PC adoption and software upgrades, we continue to advance the functionality, security, and value of Windows operating systems, including versions for new devices such as Tablet PCs, Media Center PCs, Portable Media Centers, and mobile devices such as Smartphones. We are also increasing our focus on emerging markets and reducing the amount of unlicensed software in those markets. In addition, we develop innovative software applications and solutions to enhance the productivity of information workers, improve communication and collaboration in work groups, aid business intelligence, and streamline processes for small and mid-sized businesses. To sustain the growth of our Server and Tools business amid competition from other vendors of both proprietary and open source software, our goal is to deliver products that provide the best platform for network computing — the most advanced, easiest to deploy and manage, and most secure, with the lowest total cost of ownership.
 
Worldwide macroeconomic factors have a strong correlation to business and consumer demand for our software, services, games, and Internet service offerings. We continue to expect that general macroeconomic conditions will remain stable in the remainder of fiscal year 2006.

Our revenue increase for the three and six months ended December 31, 2005 was driven primarily by increased licensing of Windows Server operating systems, SQL Server, and other server applications, growth in licensing of Windows Client operating systems through original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), the launch of Xbox 360, and increased licensing of Office and other Information Worker products, as a result of continued strong PC and server shipment growth and improved information technology (“IT”) spending. Based on our preliminary estimates, total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew 14% to 15% from the second quarter of the previous year and 15% to 16% from the first six months of the previous year driven by strong consumer demand in both emerging and mature markets. We had previously estimated that overall server hardware shipments would grow 11% to 13% in fiscal year 2006 as compared with fiscal year 2005. We estimate overall server hardware shipments growth in the second quarter and the first half of fiscal year 2006 was consistent with our full year estimate.
 
For the three months ended December 31, 2005, operating income decreased primarily due to a 27% increase in sales and marketing expenses mainly related to SQL Server 2005, Visual Studio 2005, and Xbox 360 launches, and a 13% increase in headcount mainly to support both field sales efforts and research and development for upcoming products. In addition, operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2005 decreased $410 million due to an increase in the cost of revenue primarily as a result of the Xbox 360 product launch. For the six months ended December 31, 2005, the operating income increase was primarily driven by increased Server and Tools and Client revenue, which have higher gross margins. Operating income also increased due to lower legal costs, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses related to product launches of SQL Server 2005, Visual Studio 2005, and Xbox 360, and by a $299 million increase in Home and Entertainment as a result of the Xbox 360 console launch.
 
For the remainder of fiscal year 2006, we expect revenue to grow at a faster rate than fiscal year 2005, mainly due to significant product launches in fiscal year 2006. We estimate worldwide PC shipments will grow 12% to 14% and overall server hardware shipments will also grow 11% to 13% in fiscal year 2006. We do not expect a significant impact from year-over-year foreign currency exchange rates in fiscal year 2006.
 
We expect our operating income growth rate in fiscal year 2006 to exceed our revenue growth rate. Operating income is expected to reflect lower operating expenses due to lower costs for legal settlements than in fiscal year 2005. This is expected to be partially offset by the increase in the launch-related activities surrounding our recent and upcoming products and investments in MSN.
 
SEGMENT PRODUCT REVENUE/OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)
 
Our seven segments currently are Client; Server and Tools; Information Worker; Microsoft Business Solutions; MSN; Mobile and Embedded Devices; and Home and Entertainment.
 
In order to drive greater agility in the execution of our software and services strategy, on September 20, 2005 we announced a plan to reorganize the company into three newly formed divisions – Microsoft Platform Products and Services Division, Microsoft Business Division, and Microsoft Entertainment and Devices Division. The new Microsoft Platform Products and Services Division is comprised of Client, Server and Tools, and MSN. The Information Worker business and Microsoft Business Solutions combined to form the Microsoft

Business Division. The new Microsoft Entertainment and Devices Division brought together Home and Entertainment and Mobile and Embedded Devices. The operational and internal reporting impacts of the planned reorganization are currently being evaluated. Until this evaluation of the divisions is complete, we continue to organize, manage, and report the business through the seven segments.
 
Revenue and operating income/(loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. Segment information appearing in Note 9 – Segment Information of the Notes to Financial Statements is presented on a basis consistent with the Company’s current internal management reporting, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Certain corporate level expenses have been excluded from our segment operating results and are analyzed separately. Prior amounts have been restated for certain internal reorganizations and to conform to the current period presentation.

Client includes revenue from Windows XP Professional and Home, Media Center Edition, Tablet PC Edition, and other standard Windows operating systems. Premium edition operating systems are Windows operating systems sold at a premium above Windows XP Home. Premium offerings include Windows XP Professional, Windows XP Media Center Edition, and Windows XP Tablet PC Edition. Client revenue growth is correlated with the growth of purchases of PCs from OEMs that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for over 80% of total Client revenue.
 
Client revenue increased during the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 driven by 15% growth in OEM license units and $273 million or 10% growth in OEM revenue from increased PC unit shipments partially offset by an $8 million or 2% decrease in revenue from commercial and retail licensing of Windows operating systems. This decrease in commercial and retail licensing reflects our customers’ continued preference for acquiring the next version of their operating system through the OEM channel when they replace their PC hardware, rather than purchasing a multi-year licensing agreement. The difference between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from quarter to quarter is driven by the channel mix of products sold by large, multinational OEMs versus those sold by local and regional system builders, the mix of premium versions of operating systems licensed during the quarter, and changes in the geographical mix. The mix of OEM Windows premium edition operating systems licensed as a percentage of total OEM Windows operating systems licensed increased two percentage points to 49% of total OEM Windows operating systems for the second quarter and increased one percentage point to 49% for the first half of fiscal year 2006. This premium mix result includes the effects of an increase in the mix of Windows XP Media Center Edition licenses offset by a decrease in the mix of Windows XP Professional licenses. Client revenue increased in the six months ended December 31, 2005 reflecting Windows OEM license unit growth of 16%, which drove a $592 million or 12% increase in OEM revenue compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, which was partially offset by a $119 million or 11% decline in commercial and retail licensing revenue.
 
Client operating income increased during the three and six months ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to an increase in OEM revenue, partially offset by a $105 million increase in the second quarter and a $149 million increase in the first six months in sales and marketing expenses excluding headcount-related costs mainly driven by increased investments in partner marketing and the ongoing costs of “Start Something,” a global

advertising campaign. The increase in operating income in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2006 was also partially offset by a $56 million and $60 million increase in operational headcount-related costs. The increase in headcount-related costs was mainly driven by an increase in salaries and benefits for existing employees, a 14% increase in headcount primarily associated with Windows Vista, the next-generation operating system, and further investments in our sales and marketing organization.
 
We anticipate that total PC shipments will continue to grow, at approximately 12% to 14% in fiscal year 2006, and will continue to be the primary factor influencing growth in Client revenue. In addition, we estimate that increasing shipments of laptops as a percentage of total PC systems will continue to positively influence Client revenue growth due to the shorter replacement cycles for laptops compared to desktop PCs. The time between operating system releases may impact our ability to close on some multi-year licensing agreements. We expect emerging markets to continue to outpace mature market growth rates. Piracy continues to be a challenge in both emerging and mature markets. We intend to focus on growing OEM licenses faster than the overall market by driving for gains against piracy through initiatives such as Windows Genuine Advantage and through joint programs with channel partners. Client commercial and retail licensing revenues are expected to continue to lag behind overall Client revenue growth; however, we expect to see continued improvements in these channels later in fiscal year 2006. We plan to continue our efforts to increase premium product mix and expect to see only modest improvements in fiscal year 2006, although we anticipate shipments of the premium-priced Windows XP Media Center Edition will continue to grow as a percentage of total operating systems shipped.

Server and Tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (“CALs”) for Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Exchange Server, and other server products. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier and Professional product support services, and Microsoft Consulting Services. Server and Tools concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content, and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. The segment uses multiple channels for licensing including pre-installed OEM versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. The licenses are sold both as one-time licenses and as multi-year volume licenses depending upon the needs of different customers. Server and Tools uses product innovation and partnerships with information technology professionals to drive the adoption and sales growth of its products.
 
Server and Tools revenue increased during the three and six months ended December 31, 2005 mainly driven by growth in Windows Server revenue and the product launch of SQL Server 2005. Server and Server application revenue, including CAL revenue, was driven by the SQL Server 2005 product launch and grew $300 million or 14% during the second quarter and $528 million or 13% during the first half of fiscal year 2006. The results reflect broad adoption of Windows Server System products, including Windows Server, Exchange Server, Management Servers, and especially SQL Server, which we estimate to have grown over 20%. Consulting and Premier and Professional product support services revenue increased $65 million or 17% in the second quarter and $127 million or 18% in the first half of fiscal year 2006.
 
Server and Tools operating income increased during the three and six months ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased revenue, partially offset by increases in operational headcount-related costs and sales and marketing costs. Operational headcount-related costs increased $110 million and $112 million in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2006, respectively, resulting from both an increase in salaries and benefits for

existing headcount and a 12% increase in headcount. Sales and marketing costs, excluding headcount-related costs, increased $84 million in the second quarter and $162 million in the first half of fiscal year 2006 due in part to the launch of SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio 2005.
 
We continue to expect overall server hardware shipments to grow approximately 11% to 13% in fiscal year 2006. However, we face strong competition from Linux-based, Unix, and other server operating systems as well as competition in server applications. We also expect Server and Tools operating expenses to increase during fiscal year 2006 due to expected investment in headcount and new marketing initiatives and product releases.

Information Worker consists of the Microsoft Office system of programs, servers, services, and solutions designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. Information Worker includes Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, SharePoint Portal Server CALs, and other information worker products including Microsoft LiveMeeting and OneNote. Our Office system offerings generate over 85% of Information Worker revenue. Revenue growth depends on the ability to add value to the core Office product set and expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as document lifecycle management, collaboration, and business intelligence.
 
Information Worker revenue increased during the three months ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to growth in volume licensing, retail packaged products, and preinstalled versions of Office in Japan. Revenue for volume licensing, retail packaged product, and preinstalled versions of Office in Japan increased 6% or $152 million. OEM revenue was approximately flat in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006. Information Worker revenue increased during the six months ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to a 6% or $253 million increase in volume licensing, retail packaged products, and preinstalled versions of Office in Japan. OEM revenue was approximately flat in the first six months of fiscal year 2006.
 
Information Worker operating income increased during the three and six months ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to the revenue growth, partially offset by an $84 million increase in sales and marketing costs, excluding headcount-related costs, in the second quarter and a $150 million increase in the first half of fiscal year 2006 mainly associated with increased field sales and marketing costs. Operating income growth was also partially offset by a $40 million increase in operational headcount-related costs in the second quarter and a $55 million increase in the first half of fiscal year 2006. The increase in headcount-related costs was driven by both an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 17% increase in headcount related to supporting field sales efforts, acquisitions, and research and development investments in future products.
 
We expect sustained momentum in our multi-year licensing offerings and increased sales of Office 2003 as enterprises complete their product evaluations. We expect to see revenue from retail packaged products late in the fiscal year flatten as we approach the launch of Office 12. We continue to develop plans to drive revenue growth in new areas such as the Office Live™ web-based services offering; however, we do not anticipate a significant impact on overall revenue from this work until future fiscal years.

Microsoft Business Solutions provides business management software solutions targeted to businesses of varying sizes. The main products consist of enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) solutions, customer relationship management (“CRM”) software, retail solutions, Microsoft Partner Program (“MSPP”), and related services. Microsoft Business Solutions also includes the Small and Mid-market Solutions & Partners (“SMS&P”) organization, which focuses on sales to customers and partners in the small and mid-market customer segments. Revenue is derived from software and services sales, with software sales representing a significant amount of total revenue. Software revenues include both new software licenses and enhancement plans, which provide customers with future software upgrades over the period of the plan. Our solutions are delivered through a worldwide network of channel partners that provide services and local support.
 
Microsoft Business Solutions revenue increased during the quarter ended December 31, 2005 due to 14% growth in license revenue and 24% growth in enhancement revenue. License revenue growth was supported by the release of Microsoft Dynamics CRM 3.0. For the first six months of fiscal 2006, the revenue increase was primarily due to 16% growth in license revenue and 20% growth in enhancement revenue from our ERP and CRM solutions and MSPP subscriptions, while services revenue increased approximately 3%.
 
Microsoft Business Solutions reported positive operating income for the second quarter of fiscal year 2006, mainly due to the revenue increase. Operating loss for the first half of fiscal year 2006 decreased mainly due to higher product revenue and a decline in acquisition amortization expense, partially offset by continued investments in sales and marketing.
 
We expect continued revenue growth through the Microsoft Business Solutions portfolio of business solutions and related product releases such as the releases of Microsoft Dynamics CRM, Microsoft Dynamics GP, and Microsoft Dynamics SL during the quarter. Continued investments in the next generation of solutions, broader geographical coverage, and plans for facilitating our partners to provide customized vertical solutions are expected to result in continued performance improvement over the prior year in fiscal year 2006.

MSN includes personal communications services, such as e-mail and instant messaging, and online information offerings such as MSN Search, MapPoint, and the MSN portals and channels around the world. MSN also provides a variety of online paid services in addition to MSN Internet Access and MSN Premium Web Services. Revenue is derived primarily from advertisers on MSN, from consumers and partners through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services, and from subscribers to MSN Narrowband

Internet Access. We launched MSN adCenter – our internally developed advertising platform – in certain international markets in the first half of fiscal year 2006, and are currently testing this new platform in the United States. We believe MSN adCenter will enable us to increase both display and search advertising revenues by reducing our reliance on third parties for delivering ads. Effective July 1, 2005, functions related to MapPoint previously reported in Mobile and Embedded Devices were moved to MSN. Mobile and Embedded Devices and MSN operating results for the prior periods have been restated for this reorganization. In November 2005, Microsoft announced Windows Live™, which is a set of personal Internet services and software designed to bring together personal relationships, information, and interests, with enhanced safety and security across PCs, devices, and the Web. Some Windows Live™ services entered an early beta phase in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006.
 
MSN revenue decreased during the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2006 primarily due to a decline of $67 million or 33% in Internet Access revenue for the second quarter and $129 million or 32% for the first half of fiscal year 2006. Internet Access revenue decreased as subscribers decreased to 2.4 million at December 31, 2005 from 3.5 million at December 31, 2004 due to the continued migration to broadband or other competitively priced Internet service providers. Revenue from subscriptions and transactions services other than Internet Access increased $14 million or 22% in the second quarter and $21 million or 18% in the first half of fiscal year 2006. As of December 31, 2005, MSN had approximately 230 million active Hotmail accounts and approximately 205 million active Messenger accounts, as compared to 191 million and 156 million at December 31, 2004. In addition, at December 31, 2005 MSN had 9.8 million total subscribers compared to 9.3 million at the end of the second quarter of prior year. Advertising revenue increased $40 million or 12% in the second quarter and $100 million or 16% in the first half of fiscal year 2006 due primarily to growth in display advertising on our portals, channels, email, and messaging services. Display revenue showed over 20% growth in both the three and six months ended December 31, 2005. Search revenue was impacted by an estimated 20% and 17% reduction in Revenue per Search (RPS) during the three and six months ended December 31, 2005. This reduction in RPS resulted from the ramp-up of MSN adCenter and lower than expected performance from partner driven search advertising prices, which was partially offset by low to mid-double digit growth in search volume in the second quarter and the first half of fiscal year 2006.
 
MSN operating income decreased during the three and six months ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to the decline in revenue and a $42 million increase in operational headcount-related costs in the second quarter and a $56 million increase in the first half of fiscal year 2006. The increase in operational headcount-related costs was primarily due to a 21% increase in headcount mainly related to global sales force expansion and development efforts for MSN adCenter, MSN Search and Windows Live™.
 
MSN expects increased growth in our display advertising revenue as the portals, channels, and communications services continue to expand globally and the overall Internet advertising industry continues to expand. However, we expect our overall advertising growth to continue to be tempered by the launch and ramp-up of MSN adCenter and the related pressure on our search advertising prices. We expect revenue from narrowband Internet Access to continue to decline throughout fiscal year 2006. The profitability decline experienced in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 will likely continue for the remainder of fiscal year 2006 as investments are made in the development of new applications and services, MSN Search and MSN adCenter, and expanding the field sales force. In addition, MSN may from time to time continue to make investments in improving the user experience and in some cases reducing the number of advertisements delivered either via our search tools or via our Internet portals, thereby helping to sustain and grow our user base.

Mobile and Embedded Devices includes Windows Mobile software, Windows Embedded operating systems, and Windows Automotive. These products extend the advantages of the Windows platform to mobile devices such as PDAs, phones, and a wide range of embedded devices. The business is also responsible for managing sales and customer relationships for Microsoft overall with device manufacturers and communication sector customers. The communication sector includes network service providers (such as wireless, wireline and cable operators) and media and entertainment companies. The market for products in these segments is intensely competitive. Competitive alternatives vary based on product lines and include product offerings from commercial and non-commercial mobile operating system providers, and proprietary software developed by OEMs and mobile operators. Short product life cycles in product lines such as Windows Mobile software may impact our continuing revenue streams. Effective July 1, 2005, functions related to MapPoint previously reported in Mobile and Embedded Devices have been moved to MSN. Mobile and Embedded Devices and MSN operating results for the prior periods have been restated for this reorganization.
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices revenue growth during the three and six months ended December 31, 2005 was primarily due to unit volume increases in all major product lines, especially Windows Mobile software sales and Windows Embedded operating systems. Increased revenue for Windows Mobile software was primarily driven by increased market demand for connected mobile devices such as phone-enabled PDAs and Smartphones, partially offset by slower growth in volume shipments for stand-alone PDAs. For the three months ended December 31, 2005, revenue for Windows Embedded operating systems increased $16 million or 64% and revenue for Windows Mobile software increased $11 million or 24%. For the six months ended December 31, 2005, revenue for Windows Embedded operating systems increased $28 million or 61% compared to the first half of the prior year. Revenue for Windows Mobile software increased $22 million or 31% in the same period.
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices reported increased operating income for the three and six months ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to an increase in revenue and a reduction in sales and marketing expense. This improvement was partially offset by a $15 million and a $24 million increase in operational headcount-related costs in the second quarter and in the first half of fiscal year 2006, respectively, due to an increase in salaries and benefits for existing employees and a 20% increase in headcount.
 
We expect revenue for Mobile and Embedded Devices to continue to grow in fiscal year 2006 driven by an overall increase in customer demand for connectivity, and an increase in the number of new devices being offered by OEMs incorporating Windows Embedded operating systems and new devices incorporating Windows Mobile software.

Home and Entertainment includes the Microsoft Xbox video game console system, PC games, the Home Products Division, and TV platform products for the interactive television industry. The success of video game consoles is determined by console functionality, the portfolio of video game content for the console, online services, and the market share of the console. Our Xbox business is transitioning to a new console, the Xbox 360, which launched in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006. We believe that the functionality of our new console, portfolio of games, and online services are well-positioned relative to new competitive consoles. We also believe launching in advance of competitive consoles will provide a strategic advantage for the long-term success of Xbox 360. At the same time, with the launch of Xbox 360, revenue decreased from the previous generation of Xbox products and is expected to continue to decline.
 
Home and Entertainment revenue increased during the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 primarily due to an increase in Xbox revenue of $125 million or 12%. Xbox revenue increased mainly due to the launch of Xbox 360. 1.5 million Xbox 360 console units shipped, which more than offset the approximate $300 million impact of the Halo 2 launch that occurred in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005. Revenue from Xbox was approximately flat in the first six months of fiscal year 2006. Home and Entertainment revenue increased for the first six months of fiscal year 2006 driven by consumer hardware and software, PC games, and TV platform. Revenue from consumer hardware and software, PC games, and TV platform increased $58 million or 20% in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 and $87 million or 17% in the first half of fiscal year 2006 due to growth in consumer hardware demand in the holiday season and strength of new PC games software sales, especially “Age of Empires III.”
 
Home and Entertainment operating loss in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2006 increased primarily due to an increase in product costs, product design, development, and sales and marketing expenses related to the Xbox 360 launch and due to the impact of Halo 2 sales in fiscal year 2005. Currently, Xbox consoles have negative gross margins.
 
In fiscal year 2006, we expect Xbox console unit volumes and revenue to increase from fiscal year 2005 due to the launch of Xbox 360. In fiscal year 2006, we expect PC games revenue to increase from fiscal year 2005 driven by the availability of more new game titles. We expect operating expenses and operating loss to continue to increase as a result of Xbox 360 launch-related activities and Xbox 360 console costs.

Corporate-level expenses in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 increased primarily due to a $56 million increase in sales and marketing expenses, and a $59 million increase in operational headcount-related costs resulting from both a 12% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing employees, partially offset by a decrease in other administrative costs. Corporate-level expenses in the first half of fiscal year 2006 decreased mainly due to lower legal costs, partially offset by a $103 million increase in operational headcount-related costs and a $77 million increase in sales-related expenses. Legal costs in the first half of fiscal year 2006 were lower primarily due to the RealNetworks settlement expense of $361 million being lower than the settlement expense related to the Novell settlement in the first half of fiscal year 2005 of $536 million.

Cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed, operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, and costs associated with the delivery of consulting services. The cost of revenue increased mainly due to an increase of $410 million and $299 million in Home and Entertainment in the second quarter and the first half of fiscal year 2006 as a result of an increase in the number of Xbox consoles sold driven by the Xbox 360 console launch. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in product support and consulting services costs.

Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Research and development costs increased during the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2006 mainly due to an increase in headcount-related costs of $125 million for the second quarter and $82 million for the first half of fiscal year 2006. The increase in headcount-related costs was driven by an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 12% increase in headcount. Additionally, research and development costs also grew due to an increase in product development costs associated with new and upcoming products such as Xbox 360, Windows Vista and server products.

Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation and other headcount-related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Sales and marketing expenses increased during the three and six months ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to our significant product launches in the period. Sales and marketing expense also grew due to an increase in partner and reseller marketing, the “Start Something” campaign for Windows, and the “New Era” campaign for Office. Headcount-related expenses increased $182 million in the second quarter and $270 million in the first half of fiscal year 2006 mainly due to an increase in salaries and benefits for existing employees and a 19% increase in headcount.

General and administrative costs increased during the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 mainly due to a $67 million increase in headcount-related costs, partially offset by lower legal costs. General and administrative costs decreased during the six months ended December 31, 2005 mainly due to lower legal costs, partially offset by a $104 million increase in other headcount-related costs. Legal costs in the first half of fiscal year 2006 were lower primarily due to the RealNetworks settlement expense of $361 million being lower than the legal settlement expense related to the Novell settlement in the first half of fiscal year 2005 of $536 million.

For the three months ended December 31, 2005 dividends and interest income was essentially unchanged. A decline in the average balance of dividend and interest-bearing investments as a result of the payment of the $32.64 billion special dividend on December 2, 2004 and stock buyback activity was offset by an increase in the interest rates received on our fixed income investments. For the six months ended December 31, 2005 dividends and interest income declined modestly primarily due to a decline in the average balance of dividend and interest-bearing investments as a result of the payment of the $32.64 billion special dividend on December 2, 2004 and stock buyback activity, partly offset by an increase in the interest rates received on our fixed income investments.
 
For the three and six months ended December 31, 2005 net recognized gains on investments declined primarily due to losses on sales of fixed income investments in the current period. For the three months ended

December 31, 2005, net recognized gains on investments also include other-than-temporary impairments of $37 million compared with $16 million in the comparable period in the prior year. For the six months ended December 31, 2005, net recognized gains on investments also include other-than-temporary impairments of $49 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 compared with $39 million in the comparable period in the prior year. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary.

During both the three and six months ended December 31, 2005, we experienced a decrease in losses related to equity derivatives, primarily as a result of derivatives used to economically hedge against declines in equity prices. These gains and losses are economically offset by unrealized losses and gains, respectively, in the underlying equity securities recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Commodity derivatives are held for the purpose of portfolio diversification. Gains and losses generated by our commodity derivatives are primarily a function of amounts invested combined with changes in the related underlying commodity indexes. Net losses related to foreign currency contracts relate primarily to changes in time value of options used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues. Additionally, net losses on foreign exchange contracts include the changes in the fair value of derivatives used as economic hedges. These losses are partially offset economically by unrealized gains in the underlying assets in other comprehensive income.
 
During the three months ended December 31, 2005, Microsoft and NBC Universal, Inc. (“NBC”) entered into amended and restated agreements to restructure their joint venture relationships for MSNBC Cable L.L.C. (“CJV”) and MSNBC Interactive News, L.L.C. (“IJV”). As a result, Microsoft divested 32% of CJV for $331 million and NBC acquired the right, exercisable in the following two years, to buy the remaining 18% interest. In addition, Microsoft and NBC modified their agreements to grant to IJV a content license to the U.S. only and to remove the exclusivity obligation on both NBC and Microsoft for local and non-U.S. news content. As part of the MSNBC restructuring agreements, Microsoft paid a fee of $200 million to effectively terminate IJV’s prior content license agreement and Microsoft prepaid the remaining $14 million license fee to NBC. Microsoft’s sale of its 32% investment in CJV resulted in a recognized gain of $248 million. Microsoft also recognized a loss as a result of the effective termination of IJV’s license agreement of $200 million. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2005 income from equity investees and other includes a net gain of $48 million related to the restructuring of CJV and IJV.
 
Income Taxes
 
Our effective tax rate for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2006 was 29% and 30%, respectively. We expect to have an effective tax rate of 31% for the third quarter and the remainder of fiscal year 2006. Our effective tax rate for second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2005 was 33%. The decline in the tax rate was driven by an increase in earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions and by $108 million of benefits from state audit settlements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
Cash and equivalents and short-term investments totaled $34.70 billion as of December 31, 2005, compared to $37.75 billion as of June 30, 2005. Equity and other investments were $9.09 billion as of December 31, 2005, compared to $11.00 billion as of June 30, 2005. The investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S.-dollar-denominated securities, but also includes foreign currency positions in order to diversify financial risk. The portfolio is primarily invested in short-term securities to facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs. As a result of the special dividend in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $15.93 billion at December 31, 2005. Our retained deficit is not expected to impact our future ability to operate or pay dividends given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.
 
Unearned Revenue
 
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the life cycle of the related product. Other unearned revenue includes Services, TV Platform, Microsoft Business Solutions, and advertising and subscription services in which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.
 
Unearned revenue as of December 31, 2005 decreased $329 million from June 30, 2005, reflecting recognition of unearned revenue from multi-year licensing that outpaced additions by $250 million, a $6 million increase in revenue deferred for undelivered elements, and an $85 million decrease primarily in unearned revenue for Services, TV Platform, and Microsoft Business Solutions. Unearned revenue as of December 31, 2005 increased $32 million from September 30, 2005, reflecting recognition of unearned revenue from multi-year licensing that outpaced additions by $13 million, a $28 million increase in revenue deferred for undelivered elements, and a $17 million increase primarily in unearned revenue for Services, TV Platform, and Microsoft Business Solutions.

Cash Flows
 
Cash flow from operations for the six months ended December 31, 2005 decreased $1.07 billion from the first six months of fiscal year 2005 to $6.56 billion, due to increased spending on inventories and other changes in working capital. Cash used for financing was $10.74 billion in the first half of fiscal year 2006, a decrease of $23.67 billion from the corresponding period in fiscal year 2005. The decrease is primarily due to the $32.67 billion decrease in dividends paid due to the special dividend in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005, partially offset by a $9.23 billion increase in common stock repurchases. We repurchased approximately 397 million shares for $10.55 billion during the six months ended December 31, 2005 as compared to 46 million shares repurchased for $1.28 billion during the six months ended December 31, 2004. Cash from investing was $3.43 billion in the first half of fiscal year 2006, a decrease of $12.55 billion from the first half of fiscal year 2005, due to a $12.12 billion decrease in net cash from combined investment purchases, sales, and maturities in preparation for the special dividend paid in the second quarter of the prior year.
 
We have no material long-term debt. Stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2005 was $44.21 billion. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices. We have issued residual value guarantees in connection with various operating leases. These guarantees provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value. As of December 31, 2005, the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately $271 million. We believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability currently exists. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources.
 
On December 14, 2005, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.09 per share. The dividend is payable March 9, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 17, 2006. The ex-dividend date is February 15, 2006. On September 22, 2005, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share. The dividend was paid on December 8, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 17, 2005. The ex-dividend date was November 15, 2005.
 
On October 26, 2005, our Board of Directors approved a modification to the July 20, 2004 share repurchase plan. The original repurchase plan called for up to $30 billion of Microsoft common stock to be repurchased over the succeeding four years. Under the revised plan, we expect to complete the $30 billion approved repurchase amount no later than December 2006. As of December 31, 2005, approximately $11.30 billion remained of the $30 billion approved repurchase amount. The specific timing and amount of repurchases will vary based upon market conditions, securities laws limitations, and other factors. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.
 
We believe existing cash and equivalents and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations, should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, regular quarterly dividends, and planned share repurchases. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short-term investments, as well as equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.
 
Off-balance sheet arrangements
 
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. We evaluate

estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others – an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and recission of FASB Interpretation No. 34. We consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any material liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements.
 
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
 
Prior to July 1, 2005, we accounted for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, stock-based compensation cost for all stock-based awards was measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and was recognized as expense over the service period for awards that were expected to vest.
 
Effective July 1, 2005, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, using the modified prospective application transition method. Because the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 123(R) were materially consistent under our equity plans, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) did not have a significant impact on our financial position or our results of operations. Prior to our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs were reported as operating cash flows. SFAS No. 123(R) requires excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid. As of December 31, 2005, there was $1.8 billion and $448 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to SAs and SPSAs, respectively. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.9 years and 2.7 years, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, there was $729 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock options. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.2 years.
 
In November 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position (“FSP”) FAS115-1/124-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, which addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether that impairment is other than temporary, and the measurement of an impairment loss. This FSP also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. The guidance in this FSP amends FASB Statements No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and No. 124, Accounting for Certain Investments Held by Not-for-Profit Organizations, and APB Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. This FSP is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. We do not believe the adoption of this FSP will have a material impact on our financial statements.
 
In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS123(R)-3, Transition Election to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards. This FSP requires an entity to follow either the transition guidance for the additional-paid-in-capital pool as prescribed in SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, or the alternative transition method as described in the FSP. An entity that adopts SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective application may make a one-time election to adopt the transition method described in this FSP. An entity may take up to one year from the later of its initial adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) or the effective date of this FSP to evaluate its available transition alternatives and make its one-time election. This FSP became effective in November 2005. We continue to evaluate the impact that the adoption of this FSP could have on our financial statements.
 
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s
 
32
Table of Contents

application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for stock-based compensation.
 
We account for the licensing of software in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (“SOP”) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. The application of SOP 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value exists for those elements. Customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. These elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, the fair value of which is recognized over the product’s estimated life cycle. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.
 
SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and SAB 59, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
 
SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (July 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.
 
We account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including SFAS No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, and SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS No. 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material, and accordingly, we expense all research and development costs when incurred.

The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations.
 
SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, our results of operations, or our cash flows.
 
We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted.

OVERVIEW
 
The following MD&A is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. This MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements.
 
We develop, manufacture, license, and support a wide range of software products for many computing devices. Our software products include operating systems for servers, personal computers (“PCs”) and intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; information worker productivity applications; business solutions applications; and software development tools. We provide consulting and product support services and we train and certify system integrators and developers. We sell the Xbox video game console and games, PC games, and PC peripherals. Online communication and information services are delivered through our MSN portals and channels around the world.
 
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has been highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year, generally due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Home and Entertainment segment is particularly subject to seasonality as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Historically, approximately 40% to 50% of Home and Entertainment revenue has been generated in our second fiscal quarter. We believe the seasonality of revenue is likely to continue in the future.
 
We intend to sustain the long-term growth of our businesses through technological innovation, engineering excellence, and a commitment to delivering high-quality products and services to customers and partners. Recognizing that one of our primary challenges is to help accelerate worldwide PC adoption and software upgrades, we continue to advance the functionality, security and value of Windows operating systems, including versions for new devices such as Tablet PCs, Media Center PCs, Portable Media Centers, and mobile devices such as Smartphones. We are also increasing our focus on emerging markets and reducing the amount of unlicensed software in those markets. In addition, we develop innovative software applications and solutions to enhance the productivity of information workers, improve communication and collaboration in work groups, aid business intelligence, and streamline processes for small and mid-sized businesses. To sustain the growth of our Server and Tools business amid competition from other vendors of both proprietary and open source software, our goal is to deliver products that provide the best platform for network computing — the most advanced, easiest to deploy and manage, and most secure, with the lowest total cost of ownership.
 
Worldwide macroeconomic factors have a strong correlation to business and consumer demand for our software, services, games, and Internet service offerings. We continue to expect that general macroeconomic conditions will remain stable in the remainder of fiscal year 2006.

Our revenue increase for the three months ended September 30, 2005 was driven primarily by increased licensing of Windows Server operating systems and other server applications, growth in licensing of Windows Client operating systems through original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), and increased licensing of Office and other Information Worker products, as well as favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The revenue growth rate was partially offset by a decrease in Home and Entertainment revenue due to lower customer demand in anticipation of the Xbox 360 launch. During the first quarter, continued strong PC and server shipment growth and improved information technology (“IT”) spending as compared with the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 contributed to our overall revenue growth. Based on our preliminary estimates, the total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew 15% to 17% from the first quarter of the previous year driven by strong consumer demand in both emerging and mature markets. We had previously estimated that overall server hardware shipments would grow 11% to 13% in fiscal year 2006 as compared with fiscal year 2005. Growth in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 was consistent with our estimate. Foreign exchange rates also contributed approximately $93 million or one percentage point growth in total revenue for the quarter primarily due to relative strengthening of the euro versus the U.S. dollar. We hedge a portion of our international currency exposures, thereby reducing our overall exposure. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have a greater impact on non-OEM commercial and retail license business because a significant percentage of those product revenues are denominated in foreign currencies. The vast majority of OEM license revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars.
 
For the three months ended September 30, 2005, the operating income increase was primarily driven by an increase in revenue in Server and Tools and Client, which have higher gross margins. The operating income also increased due to a net decrease in headcount-related costs including stock-based compensation expense and a reduction in legal costs, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses.
 
For the remainder of fiscal year 2006, we expect revenue to grow at a higher rate than fiscal year 2005, mainly due to the launch of Xbox 360. We estimate worldwide PC shipments will grow 9% to 11% and we are maintaining our estimate of growth for worldwide server unit shipments of 11% to 13% in fiscal year 2006. We do not expect a benefit from year-over-year foreign currency exchange rates in fiscal year 2006.
 
We expect our operating income growth rate in fiscal year 2006 to exceed our revenue growth rate. Operating income is expected to reflect lower operating expenses due to lower costs for legal settlements than incurred in fiscal year 2005 and a reduction in headcount-related expenses. This is expected to be partially offset by the increase in the launch-related activities surrounding SQL Server 2005, Visual Studio 2005, Xbox 360 and Windows Vista and investments in MSN Search.
 
SEGMENT PRODUCT REVENUE/OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)
 
Our seven segments currently are Client; Server and Tools; Information Worker; Microsoft Business Solutions; MSN; Mobile and Embedded Devices; and Home and Entertainment.
 
To drive greater agility in executing our software and services strategy, on September 20, 2005 we announced plans to reorganize the company into three newly formed divisions – Microsoft Platform Products and Services Division, Microsoft Business Division, and Microsoft Entertainment and Devices Division. The new Microsoft Platform Products and Services Division will include Client, Server and Tools, and MSN. It will be led by Kevin Johnson and Jim Allchin as co-presidents. Mr. Allchin has announced his planned retirement at the end

of calendar year 2006 following the commercial release of the Windows Vista operating system. The Information Worker business and Microsoft Business Solutions will combine to form the Microsoft Business Division, to be led by Jeff Raikes as its president. Robbie Bach has been named president of the new Microsoft Entertainment and Devices Division, which will bring together Home and Entertainment and Mobile and Embedded Devices. Also during the first quarter, the company appointed Kevin Turner to the role of chief operating officer, responsible for our sales, marketing, and service professionals on a global basis as well as the company’s fulfillment and IT operations. The operational and internal reporting impacts of the planned reorganization are currently being evaluated.
 
Revenue and operating income/(loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. Segment information appearing in Note 9 – Segment Information of the Notes to Financial Statements is presented on a basis consistent with the Company’s current internal management reporting, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Certain corporate level expenses have been excluded from our segment operating results and are analyzed separately. Fiscal year 2005 amounts have been restated for certain internal reorganizations and to conform to the current period presentation. In addition, certain prior year amounts by operating expense line item have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

Client includes revenue from Windows XP Professional and Home, Media Center Edition, Tablet PC Edition, and other standard Windows operating systems. Premium edition operating systems are Windows operating systems sold at a premium above Windows XP Home. Premium offerings include Windows XP Professional, Windows XP Media Center Edition, and Windows XP Tablet PC Edition. Client revenue growth is correlated with the growth of purchases of PCs from OEMs that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for over 80% of total Client revenue.
 
Client revenue increase for the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 was driven by an 18% growth in OEM license units and $319 million or 13% growth in OEM revenue from increased PC unit shipments partially offset by a $106 million or 19% decrease in revenue from commercial and retail licensing of Windows operating systems. This channel mix reflects our customers’ continued preference for upgrading their PC operating systems through the OEM channel when they replace their PCs versus the purchase of a multiyear licensing agreement. The difference between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from quarter to quarter are driven by the channel mix of products sold by large, multinational OEMs versus those sold by local and regional system builders, the mix of premium versions of operating systems licensed during the quarter, and changes in the geographical mix. The mix of OEM Windows operating systems licensed during the quarter with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total OEM Windows operating systems licensed during the quarter remained flat at 50% of total OEM Windows operating systems. This premium mix result includes the effects of an increase in the mix of Windows XP Media Center Edition licenses offset by a decrease in the mix of Windows XP Professional licenses.
 
Client operating income increase for the three months ended September 30, 2005 was primarily due to an increase in OEM revenue, partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing expenses associated with “Start Something,” a global advertising campaign, and higher product development costs and incremental hiring associated with Windows Vista, the next-generation operating system.

We anticipate that total PC shipments will continue to grow, at approximately 9% to 11% in fiscal year 2006, and will continue to influence growth in Client revenue. In addition, we estimate that increasing shipments of laptops as a percentage of total PC systems will continue to positively influence Client revenue growth due to the shorter replacement cycles for laptops compared with desktop PCs. The time between operating system releases may impact our ability to close on some multi-year licensing agreements. We expect emerging markets to continue to outpace mature market growth rates. Piracy continues to be a challenge in both emerging and mature markets; however significant price changes are not anticipated. We intend to focus on growing OEM licenses faster than the overall market by driving for gains against piracy through initiatives such as Windows Genuine Advantage. Client commercial and retail licensing revenues are expected to continue to lag behind overall Client revenue growth; however we expect to see improvements in these channels later in fiscal year 2006. We plan to continue our efforts to increase premium product mix and expect to see only modest improvements in fiscal year 2006, although we anticipate shipments of the premium-priced Windows XP Media Center Edition will grow as a percentage of total operating systems shipped.

Server and Tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (“CALs”) for Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Exchange Server, and other server products. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier and Professional product support services, and Microsoft Consulting Services. Server and Tools concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. The segment uses multiple channels for licensing including pre-installed OEM versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. The licenses are sold both as one-time licenses and as multiyear volume licenses depending upon the needs of different customers. Server and Tools uses product innovation and partnerships with information technology professionals to drive the adoption and sales growth of its products. Server and Tools growth is driven by performance of the overall market for information technology – both hardware and software.
 
Server and Tools revenue increased during the three months ended September 30, 2005 mainly driven by growth in Server and Server application revenue, including CAL revenue, which grew $227 million or 12% during the quarter reflecting broad adoption of Windows Server System products, including Windows Server, Exchange Server, Management Servers, and especially SQL Server. We had previously estimated that overall server hardware shipments would grow 11% to 13% in fiscal year 2006, and growth in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 was consistent with our expectation. Consulting and Premier and Professional product support services revenue increased $62 million or 18% compared to the previous year, primarily due to an increase in consulting revenue and new Premier sales and earned revenue from existing customers. Foreign currency exchange rate changes accounted for approximately $38 million of total Server and Tools revenue growth.
 
Server and Tools operating income increased during the three months ended September 30, 2005 primarily due to an increase in revenue and a decrease in headcount-related costs including stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing costs.

We continue to expect worldwide server hardware shipments to grow approximately 11% to 13% in fiscal year 2006. However, we face strong competition from Linux-based, Unix, and other server operating systems. We anticipate no year-over-year foreign currency exchange rate benefits in fiscal year 2006. We also expect Server and Tools operating expenses to increase during fiscal year 2006 due to expected investment in headcount and new marketing initiatives and upcoming product releases, including SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio 2005.

Information Worker consists of the Microsoft Office System of programs, servers, services and solutions designed to increase personal, team and organization productivity. Information Worker includes Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, SharePoint Portal Server CALs, and other information worker products including Microsoft LiveMeeting and OneNote. Most revenue from this segment comes from licensing our Office System products. Revenue growth depends on the ability to add value to the core Office product set and expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as document lifecycle management, collaboration, and business intelligence.
 
Information Worker revenue increase for the three months ended September 30, 2005 was primarily attributable to growth in volume licensing, retail packaged products, and preinstalled versions of Office in Japan, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for approximately $37 million or one percentage point of the revenue growth for the quarter. Revenue for volume licensing, retail packaged product, and preinstalled versions of Office in Japan increased 5% or $101 million, and OEM revenue was flat in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006.
 
Information Worker operating income increase for the three months ended September 30, 2005 was primarily due to the revenue growth, partially offset by increases in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and incremental hiring to support field sales efforts as well as the additional costs of Groove Networks acquired in fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005. The increase in operating income was partially offset by increases in marketing costs associated with the “New Era” advertising campaign in additional geographic markets and a focus on executing marketing programs earlier in the fiscal year.
 
The revenue growth rate for Information Worker is expected to be higher in the second quarter as compared with the first quarter. We expect sustained momentum in our OEM and multiyear licensing offerings and increased purchasing of Office System 2003 as enterprises complete their product evaluations. We expect to see slowing revenue from retail packaged product late in the year as we approach the next version launch. We anticipate no year-over-year foreign currency exchange rate benefit in fiscal year 2006.

Microsoft Business Solutions provides integrated and adaptable business management software solutions optimized for small and mid-sized businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. Microsoft Business Solutions products are developed to deliver affordable and rich functionality through an adaptable software platform that works like and with other Microsoft technologies. The main products consist of enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) solutions, customer relationship management (“CRM”) software, retail solutions, Microsoft Partner Program (“MSPP”) and related services. Microsoft Business Solutions also includes the Small and Mid-market Solutions & Partners (“SMS&P”) organization, which focuses on helping Microsoft, its customers, and industry partners in the small and mid-market customer segments. Revenue is derived from software and services sales, with software sales representing a significant amount of total revenue. Software revenues include both new software licenses and enhancement plans, which provide customers with future software upgrades over the period of the plan. Our solutions are delivered through a worldwide network of channel partners that provide specialized services and local support tailored to customer needs. The market for Microsoft Business Solutions is highly competitive, with a few strong players in the enterprise segment while the mid-market segment is more fragmented. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, we announced Microsoft Dynamics, a new brand for our financial, customer relationship, and supply chain management solutions that will replace Microsoft Business Solutions branding on subsequent product releases.
 
Microsoft Business Solutions revenue increased in the quarter ended September 30, 2005 primarily due to 18% growth in software revenue partially offset by a 3% decline in services revenue, which resulted from a strategic initiative to encourage our partners to provide more of these types of services. Performance from our ERP and CRM solutions and MSPP subscriptions resulted in growth of 21% in license and 16% in enhancement revenue.
 
Microsoft Business Solutions operating loss for the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 decreased mainly due to higher Microsoft Business Solutions product revenue and reduction in headcount-related costs driven by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. This improvement has been partially offset by continued investments in the SMS&P organization.
 
Microsoft Business Solutions expects continued revenue growth through its portfolio of business solutions and related product releases, including newer applications such as Microsoft Office Small Business Accounting and the next major release of Microsoft Dynamics CRM. Continued investment in the next generation of solutions, broader geographical coverage, and plans for facilitating our partners to provide customized vertical solutions should result in improved business performance for Microsoft Business Solutions in fiscal year 2006, compared to fiscal year 2005.

MSN includes personal communications services, such as e-mail and instant messaging, and online information offerings such as MSN Search, MapPoint, and the MSN portals and channels around the world. MSN also provides a variety of online paid services in addition to MSN Internet Access and MSN Premium Web Services. Revenue is derived primarily from advertisers on MSN, from consumers and partners through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services, and from subscribers to MSN Narrowband Internet Access. Effective July 1, 2005, functions related to MapPoint in Mobile and Embedded Devices have been moved to MSN. Mobile and Embedded Devices and MSN operating results for the prior period have been restated for this reorganization.

Table of Contents

MSN revenue remained almost flat for the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 primarily due to a decline of $62 million or 30% in Internet Access revenue, as subscribers migrate to broadband or other competitively priced Internet service providers. Advertising revenue increased $60 million or 20% from the previous year due primarily to strong growth in display advertising on our portals, channels, email, and messaging services throughout the world. Revenue from subscriptions and transactions services other than Internet Access increased $7 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 to $64 million. At the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, MSN had 2.6 million internet access subscribers compared with 3.8 million at September 30, 2004 and 9.4 million total subscribers compared to 9.1 million at the end of the first quarter of prior year. In addition, we estimate that MSN has over 440 million unique users monthly, over 215 million active Hotmail accounts and over 185 million active Messenger accounts.
 
MSN operating income increased slightly for the three months ended September 30, 2005 due to lower operational costs related to Internet Access and lower customer-acquisition-related spending, partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing and research and development costs.
 
MSN expects increased growth in advertising revenue as it benefits from improvements to its advertising platform and search engine and continued increases in Internet spending. However, we are experiencing pressure on our search advertising prices which is tempering our rate of search revenue growth. We expect revenue from narrowband Internet Access to continue to decline throughout fiscal year 2006. Profitability may decline in fiscal year 2006 as investments are made in the development of new applications and services, the search and search monetization platform, and expanding the field sales force. MSN may from time to time continue to make investments in improving the user experience and in some cases the number of advertisements delivered either via our search tools or via our Internet portals may be reduced to improve the overall user experience thereby helping to sustain and grow our user base.

Mobile and Embedded Devices includes Windows Mobile software, Windows Embedded operating systems, and Windows Automotive. These products extend the advantages of the Windows platform to mobile devices such as PDAs, phones, and a wide range of embedded devices. The business is also responsible for managing sales and customer relationships for Microsoft overall with device manufacturers and communication sector customers. The communication sector includes network service providers (such as wireless, wireline and cable operators) and media and entertainment companies. The market for products in these segments is intensely competitive. Competitive alternatives vary based on product lines and include product offerings from commercial and non-commercial mobile operating system providers, and proprietary software developed by OEMs and mobile operators. Short product lifecycles in product lines such as Windows Mobile software may impact our continuing revenue streams. Effective July 1, 2005, functions related to MapPoint in Mobile and Embedded Devices have been moved to MSN. Mobile and Embedded Devices and MSN operating results for the prior period have been restated for this reorganization.
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices revenue growth for the three months ended September 30, 2005 was primarily due to unit volume increases in all major product lines, especially Windows Mobile software sales and Windows Embedded operating systems. Increased revenue for Windows Mobile software was primarily driven by increased market demand for connected mobile devices such as phone-enabled PDAs and Smartphones, and continued with slower growth in volume shipments for standalone PDAs. The increase in Windows Embedded

revenue was due to our operating system being included in new product designs for both new and existing customers. In the three months ended September 30, 2005, revenue for Windows Embedded operating systems increased $12 million or 57% and revenue for Windows Mobile software increased $11 million or 41%.
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices operating loss for the three months ended September 30, 2005 decreased primarily due to an increase in revenue and a reduction in sales and marketing expense. This improvement was partially offset by increased salary and benefit costs from increased headcount.
 
We expect revenue for Mobile and Embedded Devices to continue to grow in fiscal year 2006 driven by an overall increase in customer demand for connectivity, and an increase in the number of new devices being offered by OEMs and mobile operators incorporating Windows Mobile software and Windows Embedded operating systems.

Home and Entertainment includes the Microsoft Xbox video game console system, PC games, the Home Products Division, and TV platform products for the interactive television industry. The success of video game consoles is determined by console functionality, the portfolio of video game content for the console, online services, and the market share of the console. Our Xbox business is transitioning to a new console, the Xbox 360, launching in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006. We believe that the functionality of our new console, portfolio of games and online services are well-positioned relative to new competitive consoles. We also believe our launch timing, expected to be in advance of competitive consoles, will provide a strategic advantage for the Xbox 360. At the same time, with the announcement of our next generation console, the current generation Xbox revenues have declined and are expected to continue to decline.
 
Home and Entertainment revenue decreased in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 primarily due to lower customer demand in anticipation of the upcoming Xbox 360 launch. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, Xbox revenues declined $132 million or 34% due to lower console volumes and lower games revenue driven by fewer software title releases. Revenue from consumer hardware and software, PC games and TV platforms increased $23 million or 9% due to the strength of new PC games software sales.
 
Home and Entertainment operating loss in first quarter of fiscal year 2006 increased primarily due to an increase in Xbox 360 product design, development and sales and marketing expenses related to launch marketing and a reduction in Xbox game revenue. The increase in operating loss was partially offset by lower console volumes and lower console costs. Historically, Xbox consoles have negative gross margins.
 
In fiscal year 2006, we expect Xbox console unit volumes and revenue to increase from fiscal year 2005 due to the launch of the Xbox 360. In fiscal year 2006 we expect PC games revenue to increase from fiscal year 2005 driven by more new game titles. We expect operating expenses and operating loss to continue to increase as we near the launch of Xbox 360 as a result of launch-related activities and higher initial Xbox 360 console costs.

Certain corporate-level expenses are not allocated to our segments. Those expenses primarily include corporate operations related to broad-based sales and marketing, product support services, human resources, legal, finance, IT, corporate development and procurement activities, research and development and other costs, and accrued legal settlements and contingencies.
 
Corporate-level expenses in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 decreased primarily due to a reduction in legal costs and headcount-related costs driven by declining stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by incremental hiring and an increase in salary and benefits for existing employees. Legal costs in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 were lower primarily due to the RealNetworks settlement expense of $361 million being lower than the legal settlement expense related to the Novell settlement in the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 of $536 million.

Cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed, operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, and costs associated with the delivery of consulting services. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, the cost of revenue declined mainly due to a $98 million reduction in Home and Entertainment product costs resulting from lower Xbox console volumes and lower console costs, and a reduction in headcount-related costs including stock-based compensation expense.

Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, research and development costs decreased mainly due to a reduction in headcount-related costs including stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by an increase in product development costs associated with Xbox 360, Windows Vista and other Server products.

Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation and other headcount-related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, tradeshows, seminars, and other programs. Sales and marketing expenses increased in the three months ended September 30, 2005 primarily due to higher marketing and higher headcount-related expenses. Marketing expenses increased mainly related to the “Start Something” campaign for Windows, the “New Era” campaign for Office, the launch of SQL Server 2005, and other upcoming launches. Headcount-related expenses increased due to incremental hiring and increased salaries and benefits, partially offset by a reduction in stock-based compensation expense.

General and administrative costs decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2005 mainly due to lower legal costs, partially offset by an increase in other headcount-related costs. Legal costs in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 were lower primarily due to the RealNetworks settlement expense of $361 million being lower than the legal settlement expense related to the Novell settlement in the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 of $536 million.

Dividends and interest income declined primarily due to a decline in the average balance of dividend and interest-bearing investments as a result of the payment of the $32.64 billion special dividend on December 2, 2004 partially offset by an increase in the interest rates received on our fixed income investments.
 
Net recognized gains on investments declined primarily due to fewer sales of investments in the current period. Net recognized gains on investments also include other-than-temporary impairments of $12 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 compared with $23 million in the comparable period in the prior year. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary.

During the current fiscal quarter we experienced an increase in gains related to equity derivatives primarily as a result of derivatives used to economically hedge against declines in equity prices. These gains are offset by unrealized losses in the underlying assets recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. The gain related to commodity positions was driven by an increase in the underlying commodity indices. Net losses on interest rate derivatives were $21 million. During the prior fiscal quarter, net losses related to interest rate derivatives were $75 million and were offset by unrealized gains related to an increase in the market value of fixed income securities included as a component of other comprehensive income. Net losses related to foreign currency contracts are related in part to hedging anticipated foreign currency revenues and economically hedging foreign currency denominated investment exposures. These losses were offset by unrealized gains in the underlying assets.
 
Income Taxes
 
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 and the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 was 31% and 33%, respectively. The decline in the tax rate was driven primarily by an increase in earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions.
 
FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
Cash and equivalents and short-term investments totaled $40.06 billion as of September 30, 2005 compared with $37.75 billion as of June 30, 2005. The increase is attributable to cash provided by operations partially offset by common stock repurchases of 114 million shares for $3.12 billion during the first quarter of fiscal year 2006. Equity and other investments were $10.06 billion as of September 30, 2005 compared to $11.00 billion as of June 30, 2005. The investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S.-dollar-denominated securities, but also includes foreign currency positions in order to diversify financial risk. The portfolio is primarily invested in short-term securities to facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs. As a result of the special dividend in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $12.54 billion at September 30, 2005. Our retained deficit is not expected to impact our future ability to operate or pay dividends given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.
 
Unearned Revenue
 
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related

Table of Contents

product’s life cycle. Other unearned revenue includes Services, TV Platform, Microsoft Business Solutions, and advertising and subscription services in which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.
 
Unearned revenue as of September 30, 2005 decreased $361 million from June 30, 2005, reflecting recognition of unearned revenue from multiyear licensing that has outpaced additions by $237 million, a $22 million decline in revenue deferred for undelivered elements, and $102 million decrease primarily in unearned revenue for Services, TV Platform, and MSN.

Cash Flows
 
Cash flow from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2005 increased $322 million from the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 to $4.33 billion, due to an increase in cash received from customers, partially offset by cash used to support other changes in working capital. Cash used for financing was $2.94 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, an increase of $2.20 billion from the corresponding period in fiscal year 2005. The increase reflects the $3.12 billion of common stock repurchases in the three months ended September 30, 2005 compared with $355 million in the prior year. The impact from share repurchases was partially offset by the increase in cash from common stock issuances of $1.00 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 as compared with $487 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2005. Cash used for investing was $3.26 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, a decrease of $4.85 billion from the first quarter of fiscal year 2005, due to a $5.08 billion decrease in net cash used for combined investment purchases, sales and maturities.
 
We have no material long-term debt. Stockholders’ equity at September 30, 2005 was $48.33 billion. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices. We have issued residual value guarantees in connection with various operating leases. These guarantees provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value. As of September 30, 2005, the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately $271 million. We believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability currently exists. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources.

On September 22, 2005, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share. The dividend is payable December 8, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 17, 2005. The ex-dividend date is November 15, 2005.
 
On October 26, 2005, our Board of Directors approved a modification to its July 20, 2004 share repurchase plan. The original repurchase plan called for up to $30 billion of Microsoft common stock to be repurchased over the succeeding four years. Under the revised plan, we expect to complete the $30 billion approved repurchase amount no later than December 2006. As of September 30, 2005, approximately $19 billion remained of the $30 billion approved repurchase amount. The specific timing and amount of repurchases will vary based upon market conditions, securities laws limitations, and other factors. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without previous notice.
 
We believe existing cash and equivalents and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations, should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, regular quarterly dividends and planned share repurchases. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short-term investments, as well as equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.
 
Prior to July 1, 2005, we accounted for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, stock-based compensation cost for all stock-based awards was measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and was recognized as expense over the service period for awards that were expected to vest.
 
Effective July 1, 2005, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, using the modified prospective application transition method. Because the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 123(R) were materially consistent under our equity plans, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) did not have a significant impact on our financial position or our results of operations. Prior to our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs were reported as operating cash flows. SFAS No.123(R) requires excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid.
 
Off-balance sheet arrangements
 
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by FIN 45. We consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements.
 
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for stock-based compensation.
 
We account for the licensing of software in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (“SOP”) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. The application of SOP 97-2

requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value exists for those elements. Customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. These elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, the fair value of which is recognized over the product’s estimated life cycle. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.
 
SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and SAB 59, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
 
SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (July 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.
 
We account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including SFAS No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, and SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS No. 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material, and accordingly, we expense all research and development costs when incurred.
 
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a

Table of Contents

contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations.
 
SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, our results of operations, or our cash flows.
 
We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) contains statements that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in “Issues and Uncertainties” in this item and elsewhere in this report.
 
OVERVIEW
 
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes.
 
We develop, manufacture, license, and support a wide range of software products for many computing devices. Our software products include operating systems for servers, personal computers (PCs), and intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; information worker productivity applications; business solutions applications; and software development tools. We provide consulting and product support services, and we train and certify system integrators and developers. We sell the Xbox video game console and games, PC games, and peripherals. Online communication tools and information offerings are delivered through our MSN portals and channels around the world.
 
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year, due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Home and Entertainment segment is particularly subject to seasonality because its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Historically, approximately 40% to 50% of Home and Entertainment revenue has been generated in the second fiscal quarter. We believe that the seasonality of revenue is likely to continue in the future.
 
We intend to sustain the long-term growth of our businesses through technological innovation, engineering excellence, and a commitment to delivering high-quality products and services to customers and partners. Recognizing that one of our primary challenges is to help accelerate worldwide PC adoption and software upgrades, we continue to advance the functionality, security and value of Windows operating systems, including versions for new devices such as Tablet PCs, Media Center PCs, Portable Media Centers, and mobile devices such as Smartphones. We also develop innovative software applications and solutions to enhance the productivity of information workers, improve communication and collaboration in work groups, and streamline business processes for small and mid-sized businesses. To sustain the growth of our Server and Tools business amid competition from other vendors of both proprietary and open source software, our goal is to deliver products that provide the best platform for network computing—the most advanced, easiest to deploy and manage and most secure—with the lowest total cost of ownership. To take advantage of new market opportunities, we continue to invest in research and development of existing and new lines of business, such as search services, that we believe can contribute significantly to our long-term growth.

Our revenue increase for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2005 was primarily driven by growth in licensing of Windows Server operating systems and other server applications, Information Worker products, and Windows Client operating systems through Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, growth in server hardware and PC shipments and overall improvements in information technology (IT) spending. The November 2004 launch of the Halo 2 Xbox game for the holiday season also contributed to the overall revenue growth for the company in the nine months ended March 31, 2005. Revenue growth rates were negatively impacted by a $251 million and $881 million decline in earned revenue from Upgrade Advantage for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2005, respectively. The reduction in Upgrade Advantage revenue has been partially offset by customers entering into other licensing agreements.
 
The impact of foreign currency exchange rates changes on revenue was positive in the three and nine months ended March 31, 2005, primarily due to relative strengthening of most foreign currencies, particularly the euro and Japanese yen, against the U.S. dollar. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for approximately $188 million or two percentage points of the revenue growth rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and $662 million or two percentage points for the first nine months of fiscal 2005. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have a greater impact on non-OEM commercial and retail license business because a significant percentage of those product revenues are denominated in foreign currencies. The vast majority of OEM license revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars. We hedge a portion of our international currency exposures, thereby reducing our overall exposure.
 
We estimate worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew about 10% during the third quarter of fiscal 2005 compared to the same period in fiscal 2004, and we estimate that Windows-based server shipments grew approximately 9% in the same period, in line with estimated growth in overall server hardware shipments.
 
For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2005, operating income increases were primarily driven by an increase in revenue, reductions in legal costs, and reduction in stock-based compensation expense (as explained in the next paragraph), which was partially offset by an increase in salary and benefits costs for new and existing headcount. General and administrative expenses declined in the third quarter and nine months due to the $2.53 billion of charges related to the settlement of Sun Microsystems litigation and the fine imposed by the European Commission in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. This affect was partially offset by $768 million in legal charges incurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, consisting of the Gateway, Inc. and Burst.com, Inc. settlements, a $54 million extension payment to Sun Microsystems, Inc. under our existing Limited Patent Covenant and Standstill Agreement, and $550 million in legal charges related to antitrust and other matters described in Note 8, Contingencies. General and administrative expenses in the nine months of fiscal 2005 also included the $536 million Novell settlement recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Additionally, stock-based compensation expense decreased $131 million and $3.08 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2005 respectively, which was partially offset by increased operating expenses of $147 million in the third quarter and $448 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2005, related to increased salary and benefits for new and existing headcount. The increase in operating income was also driven by revenue increases in Server and Tools, Information Worker and Client, which have higher gross margins as compared to other segments.
 
In fiscal 2004, we implemented changes in employee compensation whereby employees are granted stock awards rather than stock options. We also completed an employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 in which employees could elect to transfer all of their vested and unvested stock options with a strike price of $33 or higher to JPMorgan. The unvested options that were transferred to JPMorgan became vested upon the transfer. A total of 344.6 million of the 621.4 million eligible options were transferred, which resulted in additional stock-based compensation expense of $2.21 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. As a result of these changes, stock-based compensation has decreased and we expect stock-based compensation to continue to decrease in future quarters.

We estimate worldwide PC shipments from all sources will grow from 9% to 11% and Server unit shipments will grow from 13% to 15% in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. These growth rates are lower than fiscal 2004. We expect to experience favorable exchange rate impacts in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 due to stronger foreign currencies compared to the U.S. dollar versus a year ago. We expect our operating income to continue to grow faster than revenue in the remainder of the fiscal year, reflecting lower operating expenses mainly due to continued lower stock-based compensation expense, lower legal charges, and savings achieved through continued progress in our cost efficacy initiative.
 
SEGMENT PRODUCT REVENUE/OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)
 
Our seven segments are: Client; Server and Tools; Information Worker; Microsoft Business Solutions; MSN; Mobile and Embedded Devices; and Home and Entertainment.
 
The segment information in this MD&A includes certain reconciling items attributed to each of the segments. The segment information appearing in Note 9 of the Notes to Financial Statements is presented on a basis consistent with the Company’s internal management reporting, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Fiscal 2004 segment information has been restated for reclassifications due to internal reorganizations and to conform to the current period presentation including reclassifying certain legal settlements. We have reclassified approximately $1.92 billion of legal charges related to the Sun Microsystems settlement in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 from our operating segments to corporate-level activity. Certain corporate level expenses have been excluded from our segment operating results, including corporate operations related to sales and marketing, product support services, human resources, legal, finance, IT, corporate development and procurement activities, research and development costs, and accrued legal contingencies. Corporate expenses were $3.37 billion and $1.72 billion in the three months ended March 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Corporate expenses were $5.68 billion and $4.00 billion in the nine months ended March 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in corporate expenses was due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense and a decrease in legal costs primarily associated with the $2.53 billion in charges related to the Sun settlement and the European Commission fine recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, offset by the $536 million Novell settlement recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 and $768 million in legal charges related to antitrust and other matters in the third quarter of fiscal 2005.

Client includes revenue from Windows XP Professional and Home, Media Center Edition, Tablet PC Edition, and other standard Windows operating systems. Client revenue growth is correlated with the growth of purchases of PCs from OEMs that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for over 80% of total Client revenue. The operating results for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2004 have been restated to reflect the reorganization of the Windows Security group from Server and Tools to Client. Operating income for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2004 has been restated for a reclassification of legal settlements from Client to corporate expenses to conform to the current year presentation.
 
Client revenue increase for the third quarter was driven by a 10% growth in OEM licenses and $170 million or 7% growth in OEM revenue from increased PC unit shipments partially offset by a $107 million or 18% decrease in revenue from commercial and retail licensing of Windows operating systems. The differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from quarter to quarter are affected by the mix of premium versions of operating systems licensed during the quarter, changes in the geographical mix, the channel mix of products sold by large, multi-national OEMs versus those sold by local and regional system builders, and prior changes to deferral rates and product lives for undelivered elements of unearned revenue. The difference between OEM unit growth and revenue growth in the third quarter was partially attributable to the continuing impact of the fiscal 2003 revision in the deferral rates and product lives for undelivered elements of unearned revenue. The mix of OEM Windows operating systems licensed during the quarter with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total OEM Windows operating systems licensed during the quarter declined one percentage point to 49% of total OEM Windows operating systems compared to the third quarter of the prior fiscal year. Client revenue increased for the nine months ended March 31, 2005 reflecting Windows OEM license unit growth of 11%, which drove a $574 million or 8% increase in OEM revenue compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, which was partially offset by a $165 million or 9% decline in commercial and retail licensing revenue. The mix of OEM Windows operating systems licensed during the first nine months of the fiscal year with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total OEM Windows operating systems licensed during the same period remained flat at 49% of total OEM Windows operating system as compared to the first nine months of the prior fiscal year.
 
Client operating income increase for the three months ended March 31, 2005 was primarily due to the increase in OEM revenue accompanied by a slight decrease in stock-based compensation expense. The growth in operating income for the quarter was partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with product support calls related to Windows Service Pack 2 and other Windows updates. Client operating income for the first nine months of fiscal 2005 grew primarily due to lower operating expenses in the current year resulting from decreased stock-based compensation expense. This decline in operating expenses has been partially offset by an increase in salary and benefits costs associated with the headcount increases in research and development and sales and marketing, and higher costs associated with the continued development of the next generation PC operating system (Longhorn).
 
We anticipate that total PC shipments will grow at approximately 9% to 11% for the rest of fiscal 2005, continuing to influence our growth in Client revenue. We are continuing our efforts to increase premium product mix. We expect revenue growth to be affected by a decrease in revenue earned from Upgrade Advantage licensing agreements. We also expect that Enterprise Agreement (EA) contracts that expire in fiscal 2005 will be partially offset by renewals and new EA contracts. Client commercial and retail licensing revenue is expected to continue to decline in the remainder of fiscal 2005.

Server and Tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (CALs) for Windows Server, SQL Server, Exchange Server, and other server products. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier and Professional product support services, and Microsoft Consulting Services. The Server and Tools segment concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content, and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. The segment uses multiple channels for licensing including pre-installed OEM versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. The licenses are sold both as one-time licenses and as multi-year volume licenses depending upon the needs of different customer segments. The Server and Tools segment uses product innovation and partnerships with information technology professionals to drive the adoption and sales growth of its products. Server and Tools growth is driven by performance of the overall market for information technology, both hardware and software. The operating results for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 have been restated for the reorganization of the Windows Security group from Server and Tools to Client, the reorganization of Professional product support services from Information Worker to Server and Tools, the reorganization of certain expenses related to the Corporate Marketing Group from Server and Tools to corporate expenses, and the reclassification of legal settlements from Server and Tools to corporate expenses to conform to the current year presentation.
 
Server and Tools revenue increase in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 was driven by growth in SQL Server, Exchange Server and Core CAL revenue. We estimate that Windows-based server shipments grew approximately 9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, in line with estimated growth in the overall server hardware market. Server and Server applications revenue, including CAL revenue, grew $192 million or 11% in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2004, despite a $74 million decline in Upgrade Advantage earned revenue. Consulting and Premier and Professional product support services revenue increased $58 million or 18% compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher consultant utilization and new Premier customers. Foreign exchange rate changes accounted for approximately $62 million or three percentage points of total Server and Tools revenue growth. In the first nine months of fiscal 2005, we estimate that overall server hardware shipments grew 14% compared to the prior year and that Windows-based server shipments grew approximately 16%. In the first nine months of fiscal 2005, Server and Server applications revenue, including CAL revenue, grew $807 million or 17% compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2004, despite a decline of $258 million in Upgrade Advantage earned revenue. Consulting and Premier and Professional product support services revenue increased $177 million or 19% in the first nine months of fiscal 2005 compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher consultant utilization and growth in Premier customers. Foreign exchange rate changes accounted for approximately $211 million or three percentage points of total Server and Tools revenue growth for the first nine months of fiscal 2005.
 
Server and Tools operating income growth for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2005 was primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense and the increase in revenue. This was partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing costs and headcount-related costs from increased hiring in sales and marketing and increases in salary and benefits.
 
We continue to expect overall server hardware shipments to grow from 13% to 15% for full fiscal year 2005. We face strong competition from Linux-based, Unix, and other server operating systems. In addition, Server and Tools net revenue for fiscal 2005 will be unfavorably affected by the decline of revenue from our Upgrade Advantage program, which we expect will be partially offset by an increase in other multi-year volume

licensing business. We expect to experience favorable exchange rate impacts in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 due to stronger foreign currencies compared to the U.S. dollar versus a year ago. We also expect Server and Tools operating expenses to increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 due to expected investment in new headcount and new marketing initiatives and upcoming product releases in fiscal 2006, including SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio 2005.

Information Worker consists of the Microsoft Office System of programs, servers, services, and solutions designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. Information Worker includes Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, SharePoint Portal Server CALs, and other information worker products including Microsoft Live Meeting and OneNote. Most revenue from this segment comes from licensing our Office System products. Revenue growth depends on the ability to add value to the core Office product set and expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as document lifecycle and collaboration. As announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Small and Mid-Market Solutions & Partners (SMS&P) organization, which was historically part of the Information Worker segment, was re-aligned in the Microsoft Business Solutions segment. As a result of this change, Information Worker segment results have been restated to reflect the reclassification of the SMS&P organization to Microsoft Business Solutions. The results for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2004 have also been restated due to the reclassification of product support services from Information Worker into Server and Tools.
 
Information Worker revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 increased primarily driven by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Strength in the underlying retail and commercial licensing revenue was offset by the absence of Upgrade Advantage earned revenue, which accounted for $161 million of the revenue in the third quarter in fiscal 2004. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for approximately $81 million or three percentage points of revenue growth. The increase in Information Worker revenue for the nine months ended March 31, 2005 was primarily attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and strength in the underlying retail and commercial licensing revenue that offset the absence of Upgrade Advantage earned revenue, which accounted for $574 million of the revenue in the comparable period of fiscal 2004. The changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for approximately $278 million or four percentage points of the revenue growth for the first nine months of fiscal 2005 as compared with the corresponding period in the prior fiscal year.
 
Information Worker operating income growth for the three months ended March 31, 2005 was primarily due to the revenue increase partially offset by higher headcount-related costs. For the nine months ended March 31, 2005 operating income grew due to increased revenue and lower operating expenses from decreased stock-based compensation, a reduction in marketing campaign costs from the prior period associated with the launch of Office 2003, partially offset by an increase in headcount-related costs from increased hiring supporting field sales efforts and general increases in salary and benefits.
 
We expect to experience favorable exchange rate impacts in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 due to stronger foreign currencies compared to the U.S. dollar versus a year ago. We expect the continued reduction in Upgrade Advantage revenue to be offset by sustained momentum in our OEM and multi-year licensing offerings and increased purchasing of Office System 2003 as enterprises complete their product evaluations.

Microsoft Business Solutions are integrated adaptable business applications and services that allow small and mid-sized businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises to connect employees, customers, and suppliers. Microsoft Business Solutions products consist of Microsoft Great Plains, Microsoft Navision, Microsoft Axapta, Microsoft Solomon, Microsoft CRM, Microsoft Retail Management, other business applications, and the Microsoft Partner Program. The financial management, customer relationship management, supply chain management, and analytics applications work with Microsoft products such as Office and Windows to streamline processes across an entire organization. Microsoft Business Solutions are delivered through a worldwide network of channel partners that provide specialized services and local support tailored to a company’s needs. As announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, Microsoft Business Solutions now includes the SMS&P organization, which previously had been included in Information Worker. Microsoft Business Solutions results have been restated to reflect the reclassification of SMS&P for all periods presented. Also as a result of the reorganization, the Microsoft Partner Program became a component of Microsoft Business Solutions.
 
Microsoft Business Solutions revenue increased in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 as compared with the corresponding period in the prior year due to growth in new licenses, renewed license agreements, and Microsoft Partner Program subscriptions, which was offset by declines in our services revenue and online business. The decline in service revenue results from channel partners offering services previously provided by Microsoft Business Solutions. For the first nine months of fiscal 2005, the revenue increase was primarily due to an increase in software revenue from Microsoft business management applications and Microsoft Partner Program subscriptions.
 
Microsoft Business Solutions operating loss increased for the three months ended March 31, 2005 as compared with the corresponding period in the prior year primarily driven by higher headcount-related costs primarily associated with incremental hiring across the SMS&P organization along with increased marketing efforts that were partially offset by revenue growth. For the nine months ended March 31, 2005, the operating loss declined due to a combination of increased revenues, reduced stock-based compensation and acquisition amortization expenses, partially offset by increased headcount costs from hiring and increases in salary, and increases in channel marketing expenses.
 
Microsoft Business Solutions is committed to further developing its product offerings, with recently released versions of major products including Microsoft Great Plains 8.0 and the recent Extensions release, Microsoft Solomon 6.0, and Microsoft Navision 4.0. We expect revenue and share growth in the business applications market through continued investments in product innovation and our network of channel partners.

MSN includes personal communications tools, such as e-mail and instant messaging, and online information offerings, such as MSN Search and the MSN portals and channels around the world. MSN also provides a variety of paid solutions including MSN Internet Access and MSN Premium Web Services. Revenue is principally generated from advertisers on MSN, from consumers through subscriptions and transactions generated from MSN Premium Web Services, and from subscribers to MSN Narrowband Internet Access. In the third quarter of fiscal 2005, we launched a new version of our MSN Search engine, which is based on our own technology. Prior to the launch, MSN relied on third parties to deliver search results. This change provides MSN with the ability to innovate more quickly and the opportunity to develop long term competitive advantage in Search. In addition to the launch of MSN Search, we introduced a new version of the MSN home page in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 which provides a richer user experience, quicker load times, higher levels of end user customization, and fewer advertisements and links. MSN launched the clarity in advertising program on July 1, 2004, which eliminated paid inclusion and resulted in reduced number of advertisements that are returned with search results. MSN may from time to time continue to introduce products and services, such as the home page redesign and the clarity in advertising program, that invest in customer satisfaction and better user experience which at times may decrease short term advertising opportunities and revenues.
 
MSN revenue decrease for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 was driven by a decline of $68 million or 28% in Internet Access revenue, primarily from the migration of Internet Access subscribers to broadband or other competitively priced Internet service providers. This has been partially offset by increases in MSN advertising revenue and subscriptions and transactions services other than Internet Access. Advertising revenue increased $14 million or 4% from the prior year due primarily to display advertising revenue and international growth. As expected, the clarity in advertising program and the homepage redesign initiatives have tempered revenue growth in the first nine months of fiscal 2005. Revenue from subscriptions and transactions services other than Internet Access increased $27 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 to $48 million. Internet Access subscribers declined 1.6 million from the same quarter last year to 3.0 million, while total subscribers grew 830,000 from the same period last year to 9.1 million. MSN revenue for the nine months ended March 31, 2005 increased due to a $120 million or 14% increase in advertising revenue and $73 million or 126% increase in subscriptions and transactions revenue. The revenue growth was partially offset by a decline of $129 million or 18% in Internet Access revenue. At the end of the first nine months of fiscal 2005, MSN had approximately 400 million monthly unique users, 200 million active Hotmail accounts, and 165 million active Messenger accounts.
 
MSN operating income was relatively flat for the three months ended March 31, 2005 as compared with the corresponding period in the prior year. Operating income was flat primarily due to increases in headcount-related costs and marketing initiatives for MSN Search, which were partially offset by reductions in online operations and bandwidth costs associated with Internet Access business and a decline in customer acquisition costs primarily related to the acquisition of narrowband access customers. For the nine months ended March 31, 2005 compared to the prior period, operating income increased mainly due to a reduction in stock-based compensation expense, and a reduction in operations costs associated with Internet Access business. These reductions have been partially offset by an increase in headcount-related costs, and a $48 million tax benefit recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2004.
 
MSN expects advertising revenue and revenue from subscriptions and transactions for Premium Web services to continue to grow for the remainder of fiscal 2005. Advertising revenue should benefit from the relative strength of the Internet market and the related expected increases in Internet spending and additions to the advertising platform, communications innovations and an improved search engine. Advertising growth may continue to be tempered by the impact of the investments that MSN is making in improving the user experience. In some cases, the number of advertisements delivered either via our search tools or via our internet portals may be reduced to improve the overall user experience thereby helping to sustain and grow our user base. We expect revenue from narrowband Internet Access to continue declining in fiscal 2005 as narrowband subscribers continue to migrate to broadband Internet access. However, we expect the segment to continue to be profitable for the remainder of fiscal 2005.

Mobile and Embedded Devices includes Windows Mobile software, Windows Embedded operating systems, MapPoint, and Windows Automotive. These products extend the advantages of the Windows platform to mobile devices such as PDAs, phones, and a wide range of embedded devices. The business is also responsible for managing sales and customer relationships for Microsoft overall with device manufacturers and communication sector customers. The communication sector includes network service providers, such as wireless, fixed and cable and wireless operators, and media and entertainment companies. The market for products in these segments is intensely competitive. Competitive alternatives vary based on product lines and include product offerings from commercial and non-commercial mobile operating system providers, and proprietary software developed by OEMs and mobile operators. Short product lifecycles in product lines such as Windows Mobile software may impact our continuing revenue streams.
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices revenue growth for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2005 was primarily due to strength in Windows Mobile software sales and the introduction of new MapPoint products. Increased revenue for Windows Mobile software was driven by increased shipments of connected mobile devices such as phone-enabled PDAs and Smartphones, and increased market share for standalone PDAs. For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2005, revenue increased due to unit volume increases in all major product lines, especially Windows Mobile software and Windows Embedded operating systems. In the third quarter of fiscal 2005, revenue for Windows Mobile software increased $8 million or 32%, revenue for Windows Embedded operating systems increased $6 million or 27%, and revenue for MapPoint and Windows Automotive increased $5 million or 36%. For the first nine months ended March 31, 2005, revenue for Windows Mobile software increased $31 million or 42% compared to the comparable period of the prior year. Revenue for Windows Embedded operating systems increased $13 million or 21% and revenue for MapPoint and Windows Automotive increased $19 million or 48% in the same period.
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices operating loss for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2005 decreased compared to the corresponding periods in fiscal 2004 primarily due to growth in revenue, a reduction in sales and marketing expense and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. These improvements have been partially offset by increased salary and benefit costs from incremental hiring and an increase in product costs.
 
We expect sales for Mobile and Embedded Devices to continue to be driven by an overall increase in customer demand for connectivity and an increase in the number of new devices being offered by OEMs and mobile operators based on Windows Mobile software and Windows Embedded operating systems.

game consoles is determined by console functionality, the portfolio of video game content for the console, and the market share of the console. Revenue and unit volumes have grown quickly since we entered the market in 2002 and we have established ourselves as one of the market leaders. We believe our competitive position and revenue is bolstered by our increasing software game attach rates, which provides higher margins to offset the declining prices on consoles sold. Xbox consoles have negative gross margins.
 
Home and Entertainment revenue increased in the third quarter primarily due to an increase in Xbox revenue. In the third quarter of fiscal 2005, Xbox revenue increased $42 million or 13% mainly due to an increase in Xbox consoles revenue, an increase in revenue from third party games, and an increase in Xbox Live memberships. The Xbox life-to-date U.S. games attach rate increased to 8.0 games per console according to industry analyst NPD as of March 31, 2005. Revenue from consumer hardware and software, PC games, and TV platforms increased $21 million or 10% compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to strength in Mac Office. For the nine months ended March 31, 2005, Home and Entertainment revenue increased mainly because of an increase in Xbox revenue of $293 million or 19% due to strong product launches such as Halo 2 and an increase in Xbox consoles revenue, partially offset by a $39 million or 5% decline related to consumer hardware and software, PC games, and TV platforms.
 
Home and Entertainment operating loss for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2005 decreased compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2004 primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense and an increase in revenue. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in costs associated with the next generation console development efforts. Operating expenses continue to be driven by investment in the next generation Xbox platform design, sales and marketing efforts directed towards new game title development and promotions, and other headcount-related costs.
 
We continue to expect annual Xbox consoles revenue to decrease from fiscal 2004 consistent with this stage of the Xbox console lifecycle, offset by increased first and third party software unit volumes. In fiscal 2005 we expect PC games revenue to decrease from fiscal 2004 as we are releasing fewer new game titles. We expect operating margins to improve from fiscal 2004 driven by increased sales of high margin software. We continue to expect product development costs to increase, primarily due to the planned next generation console.

Cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed, operation costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, and costs associated with the delivery of consulting services. In addition to a decrease in the cost of revenue in the three and nine months ended March 31, 2005 due to lower stock-based compensation expense, our cost of revenue decreased in the third quarter due to cost reductions primarily associated with the MSN Internet Access business and a reduction in Home and Entertainment costs partially offset by an increase in Client costs. For the nine months ended March 31, 2005, our cost of revenue decreased due to a reduction in stock-based compensation expense, a $129 million reduction in costs primarily associated with the MSN Internet Access business, and a $32 million reduction in product costs mainly due to Xbox consoles cost efficiency. This decrease was partially offset by increased costs in product support and consulting services and other headcount-related costs.

Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Our research and development expenses decreased in the three and nine months ended March 31, 2005 due to lower stock-based compensation expense. This was partially offset by an increase in headcount-related costs associated with incremental hiring and product development costs associated with upcoming products, primarily the next generation of the Xbox console and related games, the Windows Client next generation operating system (Longhorn), and product development in Mobile and Embedded devices.

Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, tradeshows, seminars, and other programs. Our sales and marketing expenses increased in the three months ended March 31, 2005 due to a $110 million increase in headcount-related costs from hiring new employees and normal salary increases for existing employees. Selling costs associated with higher Enterprise Agreement direct selling costs also contributed to the increase. This was partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense and a reduction in marketing expenses. For the nine months ended March 31, 2005, sales and marketing expense slightly increased due to $300 million higher headcount-related costs from hiring and salary increases, higher product planning, direct, partner and reseller marketing expenses, and Home and Entertainment campaigns associated with the Halo 2 launch. The increase has been offset mainly by reductions in stock-based compensation expense.

expense, partially offset by an increase in other headcount-related costs from new and existing employees of $32 million and $42 million in the three and nine months ended March 31 2005 respectively. In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, general and administrative expenses included $1.92 billion of charges related to the settlement of the Sun Microsystems litigation and $605 million for the European Commission fine, while in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, we recorded $768 million in legal charges, consisting of the Gateway and Burst settlements, extension payments made to Sun Microsystems under our existing agreement, and $550 million in legal charges related to antitrust and other matters described in Note 8, Contingencies. In the nine months ended March 31, 2005, our legal expenses were driven by the $536 million Novell settlement recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 and $768 million in legal charges in the third quarter of 2005.

Dividends and interest income declined in the three and nine months ended March 31, 2005 as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2004 due to a smaller portfolio balance following the payment of a $32.64 billion special dividend on December 2, 2004 and a higher allocation of funds to lower yielding, more liquid asset classes.
 
Net gains on investments declined $325 million in the three months ended March 31, 2005 and declined $479 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2005 due primarily to fewer sales of investments as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior fiscal year. Net gains on investments also include other-than-temporary impairments of $93 million and $132 million in the three and nine months ended March 31, 2005 compared to $5 million and $66 million in the same periods in fiscal 2004.
 
Derivative instruments are used to manage exposures to interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency markets and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Net derivative losses in the nine months ended March 31, 2005 were primarily related to losses on equity derivatives, interest rate derivatives, and foreign currency contracts. During the nine months ended March 31, 2005, losses related to equity derivatives used to economically hedge against a decline in equity prices were $282 million and losses related to interest rate derivatives were $65 million. These losses were offset by the combination of realized gains on sales of securities and unrealized gains related to increases in the market value of the underlying assets included as a component of other comprehensive income. Net losses related to foreign currency contracts were $137 million, related in part to hedging anticipated foreign currency revenues while the U.S. dollar generally declined against most currencies, and economically hedging foreign currency based investment exposures. Losses related to hedging foreign currency based investment exposures were offset by unrealized gains in the underlying assets. Net gains on derivatives for the nine month period ended March 31, 2004 was primarily related to gains on interest rate and equity derivatives.
 
Net losses on equity investees and other for the prior period were reclassified into investment income and other to conform to the current period presentation.

Income Taxes
 
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2005 was 33%. The effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2004 was 42% and 35% respectively. The increased rate in 2004 resulted from the nondeductible European Commission fine. Excluding the effect of the European Commission fine, the tax rate for fiscal 2004 would have been 33%.
 
The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”) was enacted in October 2004. The Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate foreign subsidiary earnings by providing an elective 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. The Company may make this election with respect to dividends paid during either its fiscal year 2005 or 2006. The deduction is subject to a number of limitations and requirements, including a specific domestic reinvestment plan for the repatriated funds. On January 13, 2005 the U.S. Treasury published Notice 2005-10 providing guidance on the implementation of the repatriation deduction. Based on our current understanding of the Act, we believe that we may repatriate from $0 to approximately $780 million in dividends subject to the elective 85% dividends received deduction generating a corresponding tax provision benefit of $0 to approximately $179 million from the reversal of previously provided U.S. deferred tax liabilities on these unremitted foreign subsidiary earnings. We expect to confirm our understanding of this provision and if we decide to repatriate earnings, will seek the required chief executive officer and Board of Directors approval of the required domestic reinvestment plan within the timeframe the incentive is available.
 
FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
Cash and short-term investments totaled $37.59 billion as of March 31, 2005 compared to $60.59 billion as of June 30, 2004. The decline is primarily attributable to the special dividend of $3.00 per share, or $32.64 billion, which was paid on December 2, 2004 to shareholders of record on November 17, 2004. Equity and other investments were $11.77 billion as of March 31, 2005 compared to $12.21 billion as of June 30, 2004. The investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S. dollar denominated securities, but also includes foreign currency denominated positions in order to diversify financial risk. The portfolio is primarily invested in short-term securities to minimize interest rate risk and facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs. As a result of the special dividend paid in December 2004 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $11.46 billion at March 31, 2005. Our retained deficit is not expected to impact our future ability to operate or pay dividends given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.
 
Unearned Revenue
 
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements, revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, is based on the sales price of the undelivered elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product’s life cycle.
 
Unearned revenue as of March 31, 2005 decreased $25 million from December 31, 2004, reflecting a $61 million decline in revenue deferred for undelivered elements, the recognition of previous deferrals from multi-year licensing arrangements that outpaced current period billings by $157 million, partially offset by a $193 million increase primarily in unearned revenue for services, TV Platform, MSN advertising and MBS. We earned approximately $10 million and $54 million from the Upgrade Advantage programs for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2005 respectively as compared to $261 million and $935 million for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2004.

Cash Flows
 
Cash flow from operations for the nine months ended March 31, 2005 decreased $339 million from the comparable period in fiscal 2004 to $12.63 billion, due to the impact of $2.12 billion from other current liabilities and $515 million from other long term liabilities for legal cost accrual and payment activity, partially offset by an increase in cash flows of $1.38 billion from unearned revenue and $994 million from deferred taxes. Cash used for financing was $37.37 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2005, an increase of $33.71 billion from the corresponding period in fiscal 2004. The increase reflects $35.25 billion of cash dividends paid in the first three quarters of fiscal 2005 compared to $1.73 billion paid in the same period of fiscal 2004. The increase was also partially driven by a $368 million rise in cash used for common stock repurchases which was offset by a $184 million increase in cash from issuance of common stock. Net cash from investing was $14.17 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2005, an increase of $21.08 billion from the comparable period in fiscal 2004, primarily due to a $24.36 billion increase in investment maturities that occurred to fund cash dividends paid in fiscal 2005, partially offset by $3.26 billion decrease in cash from combined investment purchase and sale activity.
 
We have no material long-term debt. Stockholders’ equity at March 31, 2005 was $47.37 billion. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices. We have issued residual value guarantees in connection with various operating leases. These guarantees provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value. As of March 31, 2005, the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately $271 million. We believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability currently exists. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources.
 
On July 20, 2004, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share, or approximately $870 million which was paid on September 14, 2004, to shareholders of record on August 25, 2004. In addition, on July 20, 2004, our Board of Directors approved a special dividend of $3.00 per share, or approximately $32.64 billion, which was paid on December 2, 2004 to shareholders of record on November 17, 2004. On September 15, 2004, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share which was paid on December 2, 2004 to shareholders of record on November 17, 2004. On December 8, 2004, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share which was paid on March 10, 2005 to shareholders of record on February 17, 2005. On March 23, 2005, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share. The dividend is payable June 9, 2005 to shareholders of record on May 18, 2005. The ex-dividend date will be May 16, 2005. This dividend of $864 million was included in other current liabilities.

During the three months ended March 31, 2005, we repurchased 95.12 million shares of common stock for $2.42 billion, compared to 49.9 million shares of common stock for $1.60 billion in the comparable period of the prior year. During the nine months ended March 31, 2005, we repurchased 141.5 million shares of common stock for $3.70 billion, compared to 123.7 million shares of common stock for $3.37 billion in the comparable period of the prior year. On July 20, 2004, our Board of Directors approved a plan to repurchase up to $30 billion of common stock over the following four years, of which we have repurchased $3.70 billion as of March 31, 2005. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. In any period, cash used in financing activities related to common stock repurchased may differ from the comparable change in stockholders’ equity, reflecting timing differences between the recognition of share repurchase transactions and their settlement for cash.
 
We believe existing cash and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements and regular quarterly dividends and planned share repurchases. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short-term investments, and equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.
 
Off-balance sheet arrangements
 
As of June 30, 2004, we had guaranteed the repayment of certain Japanese yen denominated bank loans and related interest and fees of Jupiter Telecommunication, Ltd., a Japanese cable company. The total amount of these guarantees was approximately $51 million. Effective December 21, 2004, the unconditional guarantees were terminated.
 
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by FIN 45. We consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and do not believe that it is currently probable that we have material costs to support such indemnifications, and accordingly have not accrued a liability in our financial statements.
 
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
 
In September 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 03-1-1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10–20 of EITF Issue No. 03-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments”, which delays the effective date for the recognition and measurement guidance in EITF Issue No. 03-1. In addition, the FASB has issued a proposed FSP to consider whether further application guidance is necessary for securities analyzed for impairment under EITF Issue No. 03-1. We continue to assess the potential impact that the adoption of the proposed FSP could have on our financial statements.
 
In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 151, Inventory Costs, which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material. SFAS No. 151 will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 151 will have a material impact on our financial statements.
 
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, which eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for
 
28
Table of Contents

exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 will be effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 153 will have a material impact on our financial statements.
 
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, which establishes standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. This standard requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. This eliminates the exception to account for such awards using the intrinsic method previously allowable under APB Opinion No. 25. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 107, Share-Based Payment, which expresses views of the SEC Staff about the application of SFAS No. 123(R). SFAS No. 123(R) was to be effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning on or after June 15, 2005, but in April 2005 the SEC issued a rule that SFAS No. 123(R) will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after June 15, 2005. We previously adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, on July 1, 2003 and restated prior periods at that time for all awards granted to employees after July 1, 1995. Accordingly we believe SFAS No. 123(R) will not have a material impact on our balance sheet or income statements. We continue to assess the potential impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) could have on our statements of cash flows.
 
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, and accounting for income taxes.
 
We account for the licensing of software in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. The application of SOP 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for those elements. Customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. These elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, the fair value of which is recognized over the product’s estimated life cycle. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.
 
SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and SEC SAB 59, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other factors, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost; the financial health of and near-term business outlook for the investee, including factors such as industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow; and our intent and ability to hold the investment. Investments with an indicator are further evaluated to determine the likelihood of a significant adverse affect on the fair value and amount of the impairment as necessary. If market, industry and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
 
SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (July 1 for
 
29
Table of Contents

us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.
 
We account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including SFAS 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, and SFAS 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material, and accordingly, we expense all research and development costs when incurred.
 
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations.
 
SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations.
 
We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term of stock options, the expected volatility of our stock and expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) contains statements that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in “Issues and Uncertainties” in this item and elsewhere in this report.
 
OVERVIEW
 
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes (Notes). The revenue and operating income (loss) amounts in this MD&A are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Segment information appearing in Note 9 of the Notes to Financial Statements are presented in accordance with SFAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.
 
We develop, manufacture, license, and support a wide range of software products for many computing devices. Our software products include operating systems for servers, personal computers (PCs), and intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; information worker productivity applications; business solutions applications; and software development tools. We provide consulting and product support services, and we train and certify system integrators and developers. We sell the Xbox video game console and games, PC games, and peripherals. Online communication tools and information offerings are delivered through our MSN portals and channels around the world.
 
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year, due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Home and Entertainment segment is particularly subject to seasonality as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Historically, approximately 40% to 50% of Home and Entertainment revenue has been generated in the second fiscal quarter. We believe that the seasonality of revenue is likely to continue in the future.
 
We intend to sustain the long-term growth of our businesses through technological innovation, engineering excellence, and a commitment to delivering high-quality products and services to customers and partners. Recognizing that one of our primary challenges is to help accelerate worldwide PC adoption and software upgrades, we continue to advance the functionality, security and value of Windows operating systems, including versions for new devices such as Tablet PCs, Media Center PCs, Portable Media Centers, and mobile devices such as Smartphones. We also develop innovative software applications and solutions to enhance the productivity of information workers, improve communication and collaboration in work groups, and streamline processes for small and mid-sized businesses. To sustain the growth of our Server and Tools business amid competition from other vendors of both proprietary and open source software, our goal is to deliver products that provide the best platform for network computing—the most advanced, easiest to deploy and manage and most secure—with the lowest total cost of ownership. To take advantage of new market opportunities, we continue to invest in research and development of existing and new lines of business, such as search services, that we believe can contribute significantly to our long-term growth.

Our revenue increase for the three and six months ended December 31, 2004 was primarily driven by growth in licensing of Windows Server operating systems and other server applications, and Windows Client operating systems through OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), as a result of growth in server hardware and PC shipments, overall improvements in information technology (IT) spending, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The November launch of the Halo 2 Xbox game for the holiday season also contributed to the overall revenue growth for the company in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Revenue growth rates in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 were lower because of launch-related Office 2003 revenue in fiscal 2004 and a $289 million and $630 million decline in earned revenue from Upgrade Advantage for the three and six months period ended December 31, 2004, respectively. The reduction in Upgrade Advantage revenue has been partially offset by customers entering into other licensing agreements.
 
We estimate growth in PC shipments was 12% during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 compared to the same period in fiscal 2004. We estimate that total server hardware shipments grew 15%, with Windows Server shipments growing faster than the overall sector at 19% in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. The net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in the three and six month periods ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to relative strengthening of most foreign currencies particularly the Euro and Japanese yen, against the U.S. dollar. Had the exchange rates from the prior year been in effect, translated international revenue growth earned in local currencies would have been approximately $253 million or two percentage points lower for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 and $474 million or three percentage points lower for the first six months of fiscal 2005. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have a greater impact on non-OEM commercial and retail license business as a significant percentage of those product revenues are denominated in foreign currencies. The vast majority of OEM license revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars. We hedge a portion of our international currency exposures, thereby reducing our overall translation exposure.
 
For the three and six months ended December 31, 2004, the operating income increases were primarily driven by a significant decline in stock-based compensation expense primarily related to the stock option transfer program completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, combined with the increased revenue in Server and Tools and Client, which have higher gross margins as compared with other segments. Additionally, strong sales of Halo 2 drove the Home and Entertainment segment to profitability in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $2.68 billion and $2.95 billion in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2005 respectively was partially offset by increased operating expenses of $136 million in the second quarter and $314 million in the first six months of fiscal 2005, related to increased salary and benefits for new and existing headcount. The decrease in stock-based compensation was also partially offset by an increase in legal costs, primarily related to the $536 million Novell settlement recorded in the quarter ended September 30, 2004.
 
In fiscal 2004, we implemented changes in employee compensation whereby employees are granted stock awards rather than stock options. We also completed an employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 in which employees could elect to transfer all of their vested and unvested stock options with a strike price of $33 or higher to JPMorgan. The unvested options that were transferred to JPMorgan became vested upon the transfer. A total of 344.6 million of the 621.4 million eligible options were transferred, which resulted in additional stock-based compensation expense of $2.21 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. As a result of these changes, we expect stock-based compensation to continue to decrease in future quarters. Based on actual experience, during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 we revised our estimated option forfeiture rates resulting in a decrease to stock-based compensation expense of $167 million.

We estimate PC shipments will grow 9% to 11% and Server unit shipments will grow 13% to 15% in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. These growth rates are lower than fiscal 2004. We will likely experience favorable exchange rate impacts in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 due to stronger foreign currencies compared to the U.S. dollar versus a year ago. We expect our operating income to continue to grow faster than revenue in fiscal 2005. Operating income is expected to reflect lower operating expenses mainly due to continued lower stock-based compensation expense and savings achieved through continued progress in our cost efficacy initiative.
 
SEGMENT PRODUCT REVENUE/OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)
 
Our seven segments are: Client; Server and Tools; Information Worker; Microsoft Business Solutions; MSN; Mobile and Embedded Devices; and Home and Entertainment.
 
The revenue and operating income/(loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with U.S. GAAP applied at the segment level. Fiscal 2004 segment information has been restated for reclassifications due to internal reorganizations and to conform to the current period presentation including reclassifying certain legal settlements. Certain corporate level expenses have been excluded. Those expenses primarily include corporate operations related to sales and marketing, product support services, human resources, legal, finance, IT, corporate development and procurement activities, research and development costs, and accrued legal contingencies. Corporate expenses were $1.50 billion and $901 million in the three months ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively. Corporate expenses were $2.28 billion and $2.26 billion in the six months ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in corporate expenses was due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense partially offset by an increase in legal costs primarily associated with the $536 million Novell settlement recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2005.

Client includes revenue from Windows XP Professional and Home, Media Center Edition, Tablet PC Edition, and other standard Windows operating systems. Client revenue growth is correlated with the growth of purchases of PCs from OEMs that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for over 80% of total Client revenue. The operating results for the three and six months ended December 31, 2003 have been restated to reflect the reorganization of the Windows Security group from Server and Tools to Client.
 
Client revenue increase for the second quarter was driven by a 12% growth in OEM licenses and $257 million or 10% growth in OEM revenue from increased PC unit shipments partially offset by a $96 million or 16% decrease in revenue from commercial and retail licensing of Windows operating systems. The difference between OEM unit growth and revenue growth was partially attributable to the deferral rates and product lives for undelivered elements of unearned revenue. The mix of Windows operating systems licensed during the quarter with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total Client operating systems licensed during the quarter decreased by one percentage point to 54% of total Client operating systems compared to the second quarter of the prior fiscal year due to a decline in commercial and retail licensing of premium Client operating systems. Client revenue increased for the six months ended December 31, 2004 reflecting Windows OEM license unit growth of 11%, which drove a $404 million or 9% growth in OEM revenue compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, which was partially offset by a $58 million or 5% decline in commercial and retail licensing revenue. The mix of Windows operating systems licensed during the first half of the fiscal year with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total Client operating systems licensed during the same period decreased one percentage point to 57% of total Client operating system as compared to the first six months of the prior fiscal year due to a decline in commercial and retail licensing of premium Client operating systems.
 
Client operating income increase for the three and six months ended December 31, 2004 was primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense and an increase in OEM revenue. These impacts were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses associated with the continued development of the Windows Client next generation operating system (Longhorn). The operating income for the three and six months ended December 31, 2003 has been restated for a reclassification of legal settlements from Client to corporate expenses to conform to the current year presentation.
 
We plan to continue our efforts to increase premium product mix and anticipate that continued PC market growth will result in revenue growth for the remainder of fiscal 2005. We expect these factors to be partially offset by the decrease in revenue earned from Upgrade Advantage licensing agreements. We expect that our Enterprise Agreement (EA) contracts that expire in fiscal 2005 will be partially offset by renewals and new EA contracts. As a result, Client commercial and retail licensing revenue is expected to continue to lag behind overall Client revenue growth.

Server and Tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (CALs) for Windows Server, SQL Server, Exchange Server, and other server products. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier and Professional product support services, and Microsoft Consulting Services. The Server and Tools segment concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content, and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. The segment uses multiple channels for licensing including pre-installed OEM versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. The licenses are sold both as one-time licenses and as multi-year volume licenses depending upon the needs of different customer segments. The Server and Tools segment uses product innovation and partnerships with information technology professionals to drive the adoption and sales growth of its products. Server and Tools growth is driven by performance of the overall market for information technology, both hardware and software. The operating results for the first six months of fiscal 2004 have been restated for the reorganization of the Windows Security group from Server and Tools to Client and the reorganization of Professional product support services from Information Worker to Server and Tools.
 
Server and Tools revenue increase in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 was driven by a 17% growth in new Windows Server license units and growth in SQL Server, Exchange Server and Core CAL revenue. We estimate that Windows-based server shipments grew 19% in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 compared to the prior year, and that this growth rate was two to four percentage points higher than growth in the overall server hardware market. Server and Server applications revenue, including CAL revenue, grew $328 million or 20% in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2004. Consulting and Premier and Professional product support services revenue increased $54 million or 17% compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased consultant utilization and new Premier customers. Foreign exchange rate changes accounted for approximately $78 million or four percentage points of total Server and Tools revenue growth, which was offset by an $87 million decline in Upgrade Advantage revenue earned. In the first six months of fiscal 2005, we estimate that overall server hardware shipments grew 15% compared to the prior year. Server and Tools revenue increase for the first six months of fiscal 2005 was driven by an estimated 19% increase in Windows-based server shipments resulting in 17% growth in new Windows Server license units and growth in SQL Server, Exchange Server and Core CAL revenue. In the first six months of fiscal 2005, Server and Server applications revenue, including CAL revenue, grew $616 million or 20% compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2004. Consulting and Premier and Professional product support services revenue increased $118 million or 20% in the first six months of fiscal 2005 compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased consultant utilization and new Premier customers. Foreign exchange rate changes accounted for approximately $149 million or four percentage points of total Server and Tools revenue growth for the first six months of fiscal 2005, which was offset by a $184 million decline in Upgrade Advantage revenue earned.
 
Server and Tools operating income growth for the three and six months ended December 31, 2004 was primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense and the increase in revenue. This was partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing costs and headcount-related costs from increased hiring and increases in salary and benefits.
 
We expect overall server hardware shipments to grow 13% to 15% in fiscal 2005. During the first six months of fiscal 2005, new Windows-based server shipments grew faster than the overall market and we expect

this trend to continue during the remainder of fiscal 2005. However, we face strong competition from Linux-based, Unix, and other server operating systems. In addition, Server and Tools net revenue for fiscal 2005 will be unfavorably affected by the decline of revenue from our Upgrade Advantage program, which we expect will be partially offset by an increase in other multi-year volume licensing business. We will likely experience favorable exchange rate impacts in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 due to stronger foreign currencies compared to the U.S. dollar versus a year ago. We also expect Server and Tools operating expenses to increase during the remainder of fiscal 2005 due to expected investment in headcount and new marketing initiatives and upcoming product releases, including SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio 2005.

Information Worker consists of the Microsoft Office System of programs, servers, services, and solutions designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. Information Worker includes Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, SharePoint Portal Server CALs, and other information worker products including Microsoft LiveMeeting and OneNote. Most revenue from this segment comes from licensing our Office System products. Revenue growth depends on the ability to add value to the core Office product set and expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as document lifecycle and collaboration. As announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Small and Mid-Market Solutions & Partners (SMS&P) organization, which was historically part of the Information Worker segment, was re-aligned in the Microsoft Business Solutions segment. As a result of this change, Information Worker segment information has been restated to reflect the reclassification of the SMS&P organization to Microsoft Business Solutions. The results for the three and six months ended December 31, 2003 have also been restated due to the reclassification of product support services from Information Worker into Server and Tools.
 
Information Worker revenue decreased in the second quarter primarily due to the favorable impact of the launch of Office 2003 in the comparable period of the prior year. That impact included recognition of $137 million of Office 2003 revenue that had been deferred from the first quarter of fiscal 2004 related to product upgrade rights provided to the customers who purchased Office XP just prior to the launch. We experienced a decline of 4% or $104 million in retail and commercial licensing. Strength in OEM pre-installed copies of Office sold through the system builder channel continued, resulting in a 5% or $18 million growth in revenue in the OEM channel. Upgrade Advantage earned revenue declined by $175 million during the second quarter and was partially offset by approximately $99 million of revenue growth due to positive foreign exchange rate changes. The increase in Information Worker revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2004 was primarily attributable to a 4% or $157 million increase in retail and commercial licensing revenue and a 9% or $63 million increase in OEM revenue, including the impact of foreign exchange rates. Changes in foreign exchange rates accounted for approximately $196 million or four percentage points of the revenue growth for the first six months of fiscal 2005 as compared with the corresponding period in the prior fiscal year, offset by a $386 million decline in Upgrade Advantage earned revenue.
 
Information Worker operating income growth for the three and six months ended December 31, 2004 was primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. Operating expenses also declined due to a reduction in marketing campaign costs from the prior period associated with the launch of Office 2003. This has been partially offset by an increase in headcount-related costs from increased hiring and increases in salary and benefits.
 
We will likely experience favorable exchange rate impacts in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 due to stronger foreign currencies compared to the U.S. dollar versus a year ago. We expect the continued reduction in Upgrade

Microsoft Business Solutions develops and markets business applications and related services designed to help small and mid-sized companies, large corporations and divisions of global enterprises efficiently use, manage, and analyze business resources. Microsoft Business Solutions products consist of Microsoft Great Plains, Microsoft Navision, Microsoft Axapta, Microsoft Solomon, Microsoft CRM, Microsoft Retail Management, other business applications, and the Microsoft Partner Program. Microsoft Business Solutions revenue is affected by the general economic environment, and enterprise information technology spending in particular. As announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, Microsoft Business Solutions now includes the SMS&P organization, which previously had been included in Information Worker. Microsoft Business Solutions results have been restated to reflect the reclassification of SMS&P for all periods presented. Also as a result of the reorganization, the Microsoft Partner Program became a component of Microsoft Business Solutions.
 
Microsoft Business Solutions revenue remained flat in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 as compared with the corresponding period in the prior year. Growth in new licenses, renewed license agreements, and the Microsoft Partner Program subscriptions were offset by declines in services revenue and online business. Revenue from all of our business management applications grew quarter over quarter in both licenses and enhancements. The decline in service revenue is mainly attributed to a shift in our focus to encourage our partners to offer more of these services. For the first six months of fiscal 2005, the revenue increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue from Microsoft business management applications.
 
Microsoft Business Solutions operating loss declined for the three and six months ended December 31, 2004 as compared with the corresponding periods in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. The operating loss in the same time periods also declined from the comparable period in fiscal 2004 due to reduced acquisition amortization expenses and higher Microsoft Business Solutions product revenue.
 
Microsoft Business Solutions is committed to further developing its product offerings, with recently released product versions including Microsoft Great Plains 8.0 and Microsoft Solomon 6.0.

MSN includes personal communications tools, such as e-mail and instant messaging, and online information offerings, such as MSN Search and the MSN portals and channels around the world. MSN also provides a variety of paid solutions including MSN Internet Access and MSN Premium Web Services. In the second quarter of fiscal 2005, we launched the MSN Toolbar Suite beta with Desktop Search functionality, which is intended to improve search efficiency for users on their Windows-based personal computer. Revenue is principally generated from advertisers on MSN, from consumers through subscriptions and transactions generated from MSN Premium Web Services, and from subscribers to MSN Narrowband Internet Access.
 
MSN revenue increase for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 was primarily due to continued increases in MSN advertising revenue and subscriptions and transactions services other than Internet Access. Advertising revenue increased $49 million or 17% from the prior year due primarily to our strength in display advertising revenue and strong international growth. MSN launched the clarity in advertising program on July 1, 2004, which eliminated paid inclusion and reduced the number of advertisements that are returned with search results. As expected, this has tempered search revenue growth in the first six months of fiscal 2005. The increase in advertising revenue was partially offset by a decline of $33 million or 14% in Internet Access revenue, primarily from the migration of Internet Access subscribers to broadband or other competitively priced Internet service providers. Revenue from subscriptions and transactions services other than Internet Access increased $26 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 to $46 million. Internet Access subscribers declined 1.7 million from the same quarter last year to 3.5 million, while total subscribers grew 1.2 million from the same period last year to 9.3 million. MSN revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2004 increased due to a $105 million or 20% increase in advertising revenue and $47 million or 127% increase in subscriptions and transactions revenue. The revenue growth was partially offset by a decline of $61 million or 13% in Internet Access revenue. At the end of the first six months of fiscal 2005, MSN had over 380 million monthly unique users, 191 million active Hotmail accounts, and 156 million active Messenger accounts.
 
MSN operating income growth for the three and six months ended December 31, 2004 was primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. The operating income improvement in the second quarter was also attributable to increases in display advertising revenue, a decline in customer acquisition costs and other expenses related to the Internet Access business, partially offset by increases in other headcount-related costs resulting from increased hiring for sales and marketing initiatives. The increase in operating income for the first six months of fiscal 2005 was partially offset by a tax benefit of $48 million recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2004.
 
MSN expects advertising revenue and revenue from subscriptions and transactions for Premium Web services to continue to grow for the remainder of fiscal 2005. Advertising revenue should benefit from the relative strength of the Internet market and the related expected increases in Internet spending and additions to the advertising platform, communications innovations and an improved search engine. Advertising growth may be tempered by investments that MSN is making in improving the user experience. In some cases, the number of advertisements delivered either via our search tools or via our internet portals may be reduced in order to improve the overall user experience thereby helping to sustain and grow our user base. We expect revenue from narrowband Internet Access to continue declining in fiscal 2005 as narrowband subscribers continue to migrate to broadband Internet access. However, we expect the segment to continue to be profitable for the second half of fiscal 2005.

Mobile and Embedded Devices includes Windows Mobile software, Windows Embedded operating systems, MapPoint, and Windows Automotive. These products extend the advantages of the Windows platform to mobile devices such as PDAs, phones, and a wide range of embedded devices. The business is also responsible for managing sales and customer relationships for Microsoft overall with device manufacturers and communication sector customers. The communication sector includes network service providers, such as wireless, fixed and cable and wireless operators, and media and entertainment companies. The market for products in these segments is intensely competitive. Competitive alternatives vary based on product lines and include products offerings from commercial and non-commercial mobile operating system providers, and proprietary software developed by OEMs and mobile operators. Short product lifecycles in product lines such as Windows Mobile software may impact our continuing revenue streams.
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices revenue growth for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2005 was primarily due to strength in Windows Mobile software sales and the introduction of new MapPoint products. Increased revenue for Windows Mobile software was driven by increased shipments of connected mobile devices such as phone-enabled PDAs and Smartphones, and increased market share for standalone PDAs. For the three and six month periods ended December 31, 2004, revenue increased due to unit volume increases in all major product lines, especially Windows Mobile software and Windows Embedded operating systems. In the second quarter of fiscal 2005, revenue for Windows Mobile software increased $15 million or 50%, revenue for Windows Embedded operating systems increased $5 million or 24% and revenue for MapPoint and Windows Automotive increased $8 million or 67%. For the first six months ended December 31, 2004, revenue for Windows Mobile software increased $23 million or 47% compared to the comparable period of the prior year. Revenue for Windows Embedded operating systems increased $7 million or 17% and revenue for MapPoint and Windows Automotive increased $14 million or 54% in the same period.
 
The Mobile and Embedded Devices operating loss for the three and six months ended December 31, 2004 decreased compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2004 primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. The growth in revenue and a reduction in sales and marketing expense also drove improved operating results in this period compared to the prior year. This has been partially offset by increased salary and benefit costs from increased hiring.
 
We expect sales for Mobile and Embedded Devices to continue to be driven by an overall increase in customer demand for connectivity and an increase in the number of new devices being offered by OEMs and mobile operators based on Windows Mobile software and Windows Embedded operating systems.

Home and Entertainment includes the Microsoft Xbox video game console system, PC games, the Home Products Division (HPD), and TV platform products for the interactive television industry. The success of video game consoles is determined by console functionality, the portfolio of video game content for the console, and the market share of the console. Revenue and unit volumes have grown quickly since we entered the market in 2002 and we have established ourselves as one of the market leaders. However, revenue growth moderated in fiscal 2004 due to price reductions typical at this later stage in the console lifecycle. We believe our competitive position and revenue is bolstered by our increasing software game attach rates, which provides higher margins to offset the declining prices on consoles sold. Xbox consoles have negative gross margins.

Home and Entertainment revenue increased in the second quarter primarily due to significant new product launches. In the second quarter of fiscal 2005, Xbox revenue increased $180 million or 20% mainly due to the introduction of Halo 2, which generated approximately $300 million in revenue. This was partially offset by a decline in Xbox consoles revenue resulting from price reductions in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 accompanied by flat Xbox consoles volume. The Xbox life-to-date U.S. games attach rate increased to 7.7 games per console according to industry analyst NPD as of December 31, 2004. Revenue from consumer hardware and software, PC games, and TV platforms declined $40 million or 11% compared to fiscal 2004 due to lower PC games software sales. For the six months ended December 31, 2004, Home and Entertainment revenue increased mainly because of an increase in Xbox revenue of $251 million or 21% due to strong product launches, partially offset by a $60 million or 10% decline related to consumer hardware and software, PC games, and TV platforms.
 
Home and Entertainment was profitable in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 due to an increase in revenue driven by the launch of Halo 2 and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. These same factors helped reduce the operating loss in the six months ended December 31, 2004. The improvement in profitability was partially offset by an increase in costs associated with the next generation console development efforts. Operating expenses continue to be driven by investment in the next generation Xbox platform design, sales and marketing efforts directed towards new game title promotions, and other headcount-related costs.
 
We continue to expect annual Xbox consoles revenue to decrease from fiscal 2004 consistent with this stage of the Xbox console lifecycle, offset by increased software unit volumes primarily driven by the launch of software titles such as Halo 2. In fiscal 2005 we expect PC games revenue to decrease from fiscal 2004 as we are releasing fewer new game titles. We expect operating margins to improve from fiscal 2004 driven by increased sales of high margin software. We continue to expect product development costs to increase, primarily due to the planned next generation console.

Cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed, operation costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, and costs associated with the delivery of consulting services. In addition to a decrease in the cost of revenue in the three and six months ended December 31, 2004 due to lower stock-based compensation expense, our cost of revenue decreased in the second quarter due to a $103 million reduction in product costs mainly due to cost efficiency in producing Xbox consoles and a $33 million reduction in costs primarily associated with the MSN Internet Access business. These decreases in the second quarter were partially offset by increased costs in product support and consulting services and other headcount-related costs. For the six months ended December 31, 2004, our cost of revenue decreased due to an $85 million reduction in costs primarily associated with the MSN Internet Access business and an $86 million reduction in product costs mainly due to Xbox consoles cost efficiency. This decrease was partially offset by increased costs in product support and consulting services and other headcount-related costs.

Our research and development expenses decreased in the three and six months ended December 31, 2004 due to lower stock-based compensation expense. This was partially offset by an increase in product development costs associated with upcoming products, primarily the next generation of the Xbox console, the Windows Client next generation operating system (Longhorn) and product development in Mobile and Embedded devices.

This was partially offset in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 by an increase in other headcount-related costs from new and existing employees of $90 million due to hiring and salary increases. For the six months ended December 31, 2004, the decrease in sales and marketing expense was partially offset by an increase of $187 million in headcount-related costs from hiring and salary increases and by an increase in marketing expense primarily related to global marketing programs and Home and Entertainment campaigns associated with the Halo 2 launch.

ended December 31, 2004, our general and administrative expense increased mainly due to higher litigation expenses primarily driven by the $536 million Novell settlement recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 and other headcount-related costs totaling approximately $18 million. This was partially offset by a reduction in stock-based compensation expense.

Dividends and interest income declined in the three and six months ended December 31, 2004 as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2004 due to a higher allocation of funds to lower yielding, more liquid asset classes and a smaller portfolio balance following the payment of a $32.64 billion special dividend on December 2, 2004.
 
Net realized gains on investments were relatively flat in the three months ended December 31, 2004 but declined in the six months ended December 31, 2004 due to fewer sales of investments during the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Net realized gains on investments include other-than-temporary impairments of $16 million and $39 million in the three and six months ended December 31, 2004 compared to $43 million and $61 million in the same periods in fiscal 2004.
 
Derivative instruments are used to manage exposures to interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency markets. Net derivative losses in the three months ended December 31, 2004 were primarily related to losses on equity derivatives used to economically hedge against a decline in equity prices. These losses were offset by the combination of realized gains on sales of equity securities and unrealized gains related to increases in the market value of the underlying assets included as a component of other comprehensive income. Net derivative losses in the six months ended December 31, 2004 were primarily related to losses on equity derivatives, interest rate derivatives, and foreign currency contracts. During the six months ended December 31, 2004, losses related to equity derivatives were $266 million and losses related to interest rate derivatives were $75 million. These losses were offset by the combination of realized gains on sales of equity securities and unrealized gains related to increases in the market value of the underlying assets included as a component of other comprehensive income. Losses related to foreign currency contracts were $163 million, related in part to hedging anticipated foreign currency revenues while the U.S. dollar generally declined against most currencies, and economically hedging foreign currency based investment exposures. Losses related to hedging foreign currency based investment exposures were offset by unrealized gains in the underlying assets. In the first and second quarter of fiscal 2004, losses related to derivatives were not significant.
 
Net losses on equity investees and other for the prior period were reclassified into investment income and other to conform to the current period presentation.
 
Income Taxes
 
Our effective tax rate for the three and six month periods ended December 31, 2003 and 2004 was 33%.

On October 22, 2004, the President signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”). The Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate foreign subsidiary earnings by providing an elective 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. The Company may make this election with respect to dividends paid during either its fiscal year 2005 or 2006. The deduction is subject to a number of limitations and requirements, including adoption of a specific domestic reinvestment plan for the repatriated funds. On January 13, 2005 the U.S. Treasury published Notice 2005-10 providing guidance on the implementation of the repatriation deduction. Based on our current understanding of the Act, we believe that we may repatriate from $0 to approximately $780 million in dividends subject to the elective 85% dividends received deduction generating a corresponding tax provision benefit from $0 to approximately $179 million from the reversal of previously provided U.S. deferred tax liabilities on these unremitted foreign subsidiary earnings. We expect to confirm our understanding of this provision and seek the required chief executive officer and Board of Directors approval of the required domestic reinvestment plan within the timeframe the incentive is available.
 
FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
Cash and short-term investments totaled $34.50 billion as of December 31, 2004 compared to $60.59 billion as of June 30, 2004. The decline is primarily attributable to a special dividend of $3.00 per share, or $32.64 billion, which was paid on December 2, 2004 to shareholders of record on November 17, 2004. Equity and other investments were $12.16 billion as of December 31, 2004 compared to $12.21 billion as of June 30, 2004. The investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S. dollar denominated securities, but also includes foreign currency positions in order to diversify financial risk. The portfolio is primarily invested in short-term securities to minimize interest rate risk and facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs. As a result of a special dividend paid in December 2004 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income was $11.17 billion at December 31, 2004. Our retained deficit is not expected to impact our future ability to operate or pay dividends given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.
 
Unearned Revenue
 
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements, revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, is based on the sales price of the undelivered elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product’s life cycle.
 
Unearned revenue as of December 31, 2004 increased $184 million from September 30, 2004, reflecting multi-year licensing billings that outpaced recognition of previous deferrals by $203 million and a $40 million decline in revenue deferred for undelivered elements. We earned approximately $7 million and $44 million from the Upgrade Advantage programs for the three and six months ended December 31, 2004 respectively as compared to $296 million and $674 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2003.

Cash Flows
 
Cash flow from operations for the six months ended December 31, 2004 decreased $372 million from the first half of fiscal 2004 to $7.63 billion, due to the impact of a $1.16 billion decrease in other current liabilities, and a $1.83 billion increase in net income partially offset by the impact on net income of a $2.95 billion decrease in stock-based compensation expense. Cash used for financing was $34.41 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2005, an increase of $31.79 billion from the corresponding period in fiscal 2004. The increase reflects $34.37 billion of cash dividends paid in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2005. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in cash used for common stock repurchases which was $1.32 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2005 compared to $1.78 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2004. Net cash from investing was $15.30 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2005, an increase of $21.00 billion from the first six months of fiscal 2004, primarily due to a $23.26 billion increase in investment maturities that occurred to fund the cash dividends paid in the current quarter.
 
We have no material long-term debt. Stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2004 was $47.23 billion. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices. We have issued residual value guarantees in connection with various operating leases. These guarantees provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value. As of December 31, 2004, the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately $271 million. We believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability currently exists. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources.
 
On July 20, 2004, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share, or approximately $870 million which was paid on September 14, 2004, to shareholders of record on August 25, 2004. In addition, on July 20, 2004, our Board of Directors approved a special dividend of $3.00 per share, or $32.64 billion, which was paid on December 2, 2004 to shareholders of record on November 17, 2004. On September 15, 2004, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share which was paid December 2, 2004, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 17, 2004. On December 8, 2004, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share, which is payable March 10, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 17, 2005. The ex-dividend date will be February 15, 2005. This dividend of approximately $870 million was included in other current liabilities on our balance sheet.

During the three months ended December 31, 2004, we repurchased 23.6 million shares of common stock for $655 million, compared to 30.5 million shares of common stock for $830 million in the comparable period of the prior year. During the six months ended December 31, 2004, we repurchased 46.4 million shares of common stock for $1.28 billion, compared to 73.8 million shares of common stock for $2.02 billion in the comparable period of the prior year. On July 20, 2004, our Board of Directors approved a plan to repurchase up to $30 billion of common stock over the following four years, of which we have repurchased $1.28 billion as of December 31, 2004. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. In any period, cash used in financing activities related to common stock repurchased may differ from the comparable change in stockholders’ equity, reflecting timing differences between the recognition of share repurchase transactions and their settlement for cash.
 
We believe existing cash and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements and regular quarterly dividends and planned share repurchases. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short-term investments, and equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.
 
Off-balance sheet arrangements
 
As of June 30, 2004, we had guaranteed the repayment of certain Japanese yen denominated bank loans and related interest and fees of Jupiter Telecommunication, Ltd., a Japanese cable company (Jupiter). The total amount of these guarantees was approximately $51 million. Effective December 21, 2004, the unconditional guarantees were terminated.
 
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by FIN 45. We consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and do not believe that it is currently probable that we have material costs to support such indemnifications, and accordingly have not accrued a liability in our financial statements.
 
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
 
In September 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 03-1-1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10–20 of EITF Issue No. 03-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments”, which delays the effective date for the recognition and measurement guidance in EITF Issue No. 03-1. In addition, the FASB has issued a proposed FSP to consider whether further application guidance is necessary for securities analyzed for impairment under EITF Issue No. 03-1. We continue to assess the potential impact that the adoption of the proposed FSP could have on our financial statements.
 
In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 151, Inventory Costs, which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material. SFAS No. 151 will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 151 will have a material impact on our financial statements.
 
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, which eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for
 
28
Table of Contents

exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 will be effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 153 will have a material impact on our financial statements.
 
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, which establishes standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. This standard requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. This eliminates the exception to account for such awards using the intrinsic method previously allowable under APB Opinion No. 25. SFAS No. 123(R) will be effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning on or after June 15, 2005. We previously adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, on July 1, 2003 and restated prior periods at that time for all awards granted to employees after July 1, 1995. Accordingly we believe SFAS No. 123(R) will not have a material impact on our balance sheet or income statements. We continue to assess the potential impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) could have on our statements of cash flows.
 
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, and accounting for income taxes.
 
We account for the licensing of software in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. The application of SOP 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for those elements. Customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. These elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, the fair value of which is recognized over the product’s estimated life cycle. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.
 
SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 59, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other factors, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost; the financial health of and near-term business outlook for the investee, including factors such as industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow; and our intent and ability to hold the investment. Investments with an indicator are further evaluated to determine the likelihood of a significant adverse effect on the fair value and amount of the impairment as necessary. If market, industry and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
 
SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (July 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or
 
29
Table of Contents

disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.
 
We account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including SFAS 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, and SFAS 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material, and accordingly, we expense all research and development costs when incurred.
 
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations.
 
SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations.
 
We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term of stock options, the expected volatility of our stock, expected dividends, and risk-free interest rates. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) contains statements that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in “Issues and Uncertainties” and elsewhere in this report.
 
OVERVIEW
 
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes (“Notes”).
 
We generate revenue, income, and cash flows by developing, manufacturing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products for many computing devices. Our software products include operating systems for servers, personal computers (PCs), and intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; information worker productivity applications; business solutions applications; and software development tools. We provide consulting and product support services, and we train and certify system integrators and developers. We sell the Xbox video game console and games, PC games, and peripherals. Online communication services and information services are delivered through our MSN portals and channels around the world.
 
Our revenues historically have fluctuated quarterly and have been highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year, generally due to the holiday season spending by consumers and corporate calendar year end spending trends in our major markets. Our Home and Entertainment segment is particularly subject to seasonality due to the nature of its products. We have historically experienced that approximately 40% to 50% of Home and Entertainment revenues have been generated in the second fiscal quarter. We believe that the seasonality of revenues is likely to continue. Our historical seasonality could be impacted by future spending patterns.
 
We work to sustain the long-term growth of our businesses through technological innovation, engineering excellence, and a commitment to delivering high-quality experiences to customers and partners. Recognizing that one of our primary challenges is to help accelerate worldwide PC adoption and software upgrades, we continue to advance the functionality, security and affordability of Windows operating systems, including versions for new devices such as Tablet PCs, Media Center PCs, Portable Media Centers, and mobile SmartPhones. We also develop innovative software applications and solutions to enhance the productivity of information workers, improve communication and collaboration in work groups, and streamline processes for small and mid-sized businesses. To sustain the growth of our Server and Tools business amid competition from other vendors of both proprietary and open source software, our goal is to deliver products that provide the best platform for network computing—the most advanced, easiest to deploy and manage, most secure, and with the lowest total cost of acquisition and ownership. To take advantage of emerging market opportunities, we continue to invest in research and development of existing and new lines of business, such as online music and search services, that we believe can contribute significantly to our long-term growth.

Our revenue increase for the three months ended September 30, 2004 was primarily driven by growth in licensing of Windows Server operating systems and other server applications, Information Worker products and
 
13
Table of Contents

Windows Client operating systems through OEMs, as a result of growth in PC and server hardware shipments and overall improvements in IT spending. We believe that small and mid-market customers led the improvements in IT spending.
 
We estimate growth in PC shipments was 10% during the first quarter of fiscal 2005 compared to the same period in fiscal 2004. We estimate that total server hardware shipments grew 16%, with Windows Server shipments growing faster than the overall sector at 18% in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in the three months ended September 30, 2004, primarily due to relative strengthening of most foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. Had the rates from prior year been in effect in first quarter fiscal 2005, translated international revenue earned in local currencies would have been approximately $221 million lower. We hedge a portion of our international currency exposures, thereby reducing our overall translation exposure.
 
For the three months ended September 30, 2004, the operating income increase of $346 million was primarily driven by an increase in revenue in Client and Information Worker, which have higher gross margins as compared with other segments. Increased legal expenses, primarily related to the $536 million in litigation expenses as described in Note 9 of the Notes to Financial Statements, and marketing spending increases partially offset the revenue increase and a decrease in headcount-related costs. Headcount-related costs decreased primarily due to a $270 million decline in stock-based compensation expense.
 
Due to the nature and timing of the Novell and certain other immaterial settlements as described in Note 9 of the Notes to Financial Statements, the results for the three months ended September 30, 2004 that were previously released on October 21, 2004 have been updated to include the impact of these settlements. Net income and earnings per share for the quarter were $2.53 billion and $0.23 respectively, including $373 million ($557 million pre-tax) relating to these matters.
 
We expect general economic conditions to remain stable and estimate PC shipments will grow from 8% to 10% and Server unit shipments will grow from 13% to 15% in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. These lower growth rates may cause slower revenue growth in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. We expect our operating income growth in fiscal 2005 to exceed our revenue growth. Operating income is expected to reflect lower operating expenses due to the absence of certain legal settlements that occurred in fiscal 2004, lower stock-based compensation costs, and benefits achieved through continued progress in our cost efficacy initiative.
 
SEGMENT PRODUCT REVENUE/OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)
 
Our seven segments are: Client; Server and Tools; Information Worker; Microsoft Business Solutions; MSN; Mobile and Embedded Devices; and Home and Entertainment.
 
The revenue and operating income/(loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with U.S. GAAP applied at the segment level. Fiscal 2004 segment information has been restated for certain internal reorganization and changes to certain internal accounting methods to conform to the current period presentation. Certain corporate level expenses have been excluded. Those expenses primarily include corporate operations related to sales and marketing, product support services, human resources, legal, finance, IT, corporate development and procurement activities, research and development and other costs, and accrued legal contingencies. Corporate expenses were $785 million, and $1.36 billion in the three months ended September 30, 2003 and 2004 respectively. The increase in corporate expenses was due to an increase in litigation expenses, primarily associated with the $536 million in litigation expenses related to the Novell settlement described in Note 9 of the Notes to Financial Statements.
 
Corporate expenses and the operating loss for Microsoft Business Solutions for the three months ended September 30, 2003 presented herein differ by an offsetting amount of $14 million from our previously released results in exhibit 99.1 on our Form 8-K furnished on October 21, 2004 in conjunction with our quarterly earnings release. These results for the three months ended September 30, 2003 differ due to an internal reorganization that was not processed until subsequent to the earnings release. This error did not impact consolidated results of operations or earnings per share.

Client includes revenue from Windows XP Professional and Home, Windows 2000 Professional, and other standard Windows operating systems. The Client revenue growth is largely correlated with the growth of purchases of PCs from OEMs that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems.
 
Client revenue increase was driven by a 10% growth in OEM licenses and 6% growth in OEM revenue from increased PC unit shipments. The difference between OEM unit growth and revenue growth was driven partially by the continuing impact of the fiscal 2003 revision in the deferral rates and product lives on undelivered elements of unearned revenue. The mix of Windows operating systems licensed during the quarter with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total Client operating systems licensed during the quarter decreased by 2 percentage points to 60% of total Client operating system as compared to the first quarter of the prior fiscal year because of a decline in commercial and retail licensing of premium Client operating systems.
 
Client operating income for the quarter increased from the prior year due to growth in Client OEM revenue and a decrease in headcount-related costs primarily associated with a $29 million decline in stock-based compensation. These impacts were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses associated with the continued development of the Windows Client next generation operating system (Longhorn) and completion and delivery of revisions addressing security vulnerabilities and program fixes including Windows Service Pack 2. The operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 has been restated due to the reclassification of the Windows Security group within Client from Server and Tools.
 
We plan to continue our efforts to increase premium product mix and anticipate that continued PC market growth will result in revenue growth for the remainder of fiscal 2005. We expect these impacts to be partially offset by the decrease in revenue earned from Upgrade Advantage licensing agreements. We expect that our Enterprise Agreement (EA) contracts that expire in fiscal 2005 will be partially offset by renewals and new EA contracts. The Client commercial and retail licensing revenue is expected to continue to lag behind overall Client revenue growth.

Server and Tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (CALs) for Windows Server, SQL Server, Exchange Server, and other servers. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier and Professional product support services, and Microsoft consulting services. The segment concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content, and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. The segment uses multiple channels for licensing including pre-installed OEM versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. The licenses are sold both as one-time licenses and as multi-year volume licenses depending upon the needs of different customer segments. The segment uses product innovation and partnerships with information technology

professionals to drive the adoption and sales growth of its products. Server and Tools growth is driven by performance of the overall market for information technology, both hardware and software. The results for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 have been restated due to the reclassification of Professional product support services from Information Worker into Server and Tools.
 
We estimate that overall server hardware shipments grew 16% in the first three months of fiscal 2005 compared to the prior year. The Server and Tools revenue increase was driven by an estimated 18% increase in Windows-based server shipments resulting in 19% growth in new Windows Server license units as well as growth in SQL Server, Exchange Server and Core CAL revenue. Server and Server applications revenue, including CAL revenue, grew $288 million or 20% in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2004. Consulting and Premier and Professional product support services revenue increased $64 million or 23% compared to the prior year primarily due to increased consultant utilization and new Premier customers. Foreign exchange rate changes provided approximately $71 million or 4 percentage points of total Server and Tools revenue growth.
 
Server and Tools operating income growth was primarily due to a 19% increase in revenue and a 2% growth in operating expenses. Lower headcount costs, driven primarily by a $94 million decline in stock-based compensation partially offset by an increase in research and development costs associated with product development for upcoming products such as SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio 2005, contributed to the relatively low growth in operating expenses. The operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 has been restated due to the reclassification of Windows Security group within Client from Server and Tools.
 
We expect overall server hardware shipments to grow from 13% to 15% in fiscal 2005, which is in line with our expectations at the end of fiscal 2004. New Windows-based Server shipments during the first three months of fiscal 2005 grew faster than the overall market and we expect this trend to continue in fiscal 2005. However, we face strong competition from Linux-based, Unix, and other server operating systems. In addition, Server and Tools net revenue for fiscal 2005 will be unfavorably affected by the absence of revenue earned from our Upgrade Advantage program, which we expect will be partially offset by an increase in other multi-year volume licensing business. We expect operating expenses to increase during the remainder of fiscal 2005 due to expected investment in headcount and new marketing initiatives.

Information Worker consists of the Microsoft Office System of programs, servers, services, and solutions designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. Information Worker includes Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, SharePoint Portal Server CALs, and other information worker products including Microsoft LiveMeeting and OneNote. Most revenue from this segment comes from licensing our Office System products. Revenue growth depends on the ability to add value to the core Office product set and expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as document lifecycle and collaboration. As announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Small and Mid-Market Solutions & Partners (SMS&P) organization, which was historically part of the Information Worker segment, was aligned in the Microsoft Business Solutions segment. As a result of this re-alignment, Information Worker segment information has been restated to reflect the transfer of the SMS&P organization to Microsoft Business Solutions. The results for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 have also been restated due to the reclassification of product support services from Information Worker into Server and Tools.

Table of Contents

The increase in Information Worker revenue was primarily attributable to 13% or $261 million in volume licensing and retail packaged product growth driven by the continued strength of Office 2003 and a favorable comparison to the first quarter of fiscal 2004 due to $137 million of revenue deferred for Office 2003 product upgrade rights provided to customers who purchased Office in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. Additionally, foreign exchange rate changes provided approximately $97 million or 4 percentage points of revenue growth compared to the first quarter of the prior year. Continued strength of Office 2003 also resulted in OEM licensing revenue growth of 15% or $45 million in the first quarter fiscal 2005 as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2004.
 
Information Worker operating income in the three months ended September 30, 2004 increased from the prior year primarily due to growth in revenue and a reduction in operating expense associated with headcount-related costs primarily from a $32 million decline in stock-based compensation in the quarter.
 
We will likely experience favorable exchange rate impacts in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 due to strong foreign currencies compared to the US dollar a year ago. We expect the continued reduction in Upgrade Advantage earned revenue to be partially offset by sustained momentum in our OEM and multi-year licensing offerings and increased purchasing of Office System 2003 as enterprises complete their product evaluations.

Microsoft Business Solutions develops and markets business applications and related services designed to help small and mid-market businesses as well as divisions of large enterprises efficiently use, manage, and analyze business resources. Our products consist of Microsoft Great Plains, Microsoft Navision, Microsoft Axapta, Microsoft Solomon, Microsoft CRM, MBN/Retail Manager, other business applications, and the Microsoft Partner Program. Microsoft Business Solutions revenues are affected by the general economic environment and enterprise information technology spending in particular. As announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, Microsoft Business Solutions now includes the SMS&P organization, which previously had been included in Information Worker. Microsoft Business Solution results have been restated to reflect the inclusion of SMS&P for all periods presented. Also as a result of the reorganization, Microsoft Partner Program became a component of Microsoft Business Solutions.
 
The increase in Microsoft Business Solutions revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2004 was driven by continued growth from Microsoft CRM and Microsoft Axapta products, together with a 26% increase in Microsoft Partner Program revenue.
 
The operating loss for the three months ended September 30, 2004 declined from the comparable period in fiscal 2004 due to higher Microsoft Business Solutions product revenue, reduced acquisition amortization costs, and lower headcount—related costs primarily associated with a $16 million decline in stock-based compensation in the first quarter of fiscal 2005.
 
Microsoft Business Solutions is committed to further developing its product offerings, with recently released product versions including Great Plains 8.0 and Solomon 6.0, and the upcoming release of Navision 4.0 in the second quarter of the current fiscal year. In fiscal 2005, we expect continued growth for Microsoft Business Solutions through CRM, Axapta, Navision, and Great Plains product lines with increased sales and marketing focus from the SMS&P organization.

MSN includes personal communications services, such as e-mail and instant messaging, and information services, such as MSN Search and the MSN portals and channels around the World. MSN also provides a variety of paid services resulting in revenue for the segment including MSN Internet Access, and MSN Premium Web Services. Revenue is principally generated from advertisers on MSN, from consumers through subscriptions and transactions generated from MSN Premium Web Services and from subscribers to MSN Narrowband Internet Access.
 
In the first quarter of 2005, MSN advertising revenue increased $56 million or 23% from the prior year. The increase was partially offset by a decline of $28 million or 12% in Internet Access revenue, primarily from the migration of Internet Access subscribers to broadband or other competitively priced Internet service providers. Revenue from subscriptions and transactions services other than Internet Access increased $21 million in the first quarter of 2005 to $38 million. At the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2005, MSN had 3.8 million Internet Access subscribers compared to 5.6 million at the end of the same quarter last year, and 9.1 million total subscribers compared to 8.0 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2004. In addition, MSN has over 350 million unique users monthly, 187 million active Hotmail accounts, and 146 million active Messenger accounts.
 
MSN operating income improvement was attributable to an increase in revenue from advertising in both display and paid search, a decline in customer acquisition costs and other expenses related to the Internet Access business, and a reduction in headcount-related costs primarily associated with a $19 million decline in stock-based compensation. The increase in operating income was partially offset by a tax benefit of $48 million recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2004.
 
MSN expects advertising revenue and revenue from subscriptions and transactions for Premium Web services to continue to grow for the remainder of fiscal 2005. Advertising revenue should benefit from expected increases in Internet spending and additions to the advertising platform including the music download service, communications innovations, and an improved search engine. We expect revenue from narrowband Internet access to continue declining in fiscal 2005 as narrowband subscribers continue to migrate to broadband Internet access. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we announced an increase to the amount of storage we will provide for select MSN and Hotmail email accounts which will increase operating costs and may impact the revenue from our premium email customers. However, we expect the segment to continue increasing its profitability.

with device manufacturers and with network service providers, including telecommunication, cable and wireless companies, and host and network equipment providers. The embedded operating system market is highly fragmented with many competitive offerings and relatively short product life cycles that affect our continuing revenue streams.
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices segment revenue growth was primarily driven by unit volume increases in all product lines, especially embedded products and MapPoint. The growth was driven by embedded products due to increased shipments in existing channels and an expansion of the distribution channel, increasing market share for Pocket PCs, and the introduction of new MapPoint products. The growth was hampered by delayed introduction of new SmartPhone devices. MapPoint revenue benefited from Street & Trips 2005 and Street & Trips GPS bundle that were launched in August 2004.
 
The operating loss for Mobile and Embedded Devices for the three months ended September 30, 2004 decreased compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2004 primarily due to an increase in revenue and a reduction in headcount-related costs primarily associated with a $9 million decline in stock-based compensation.
 
We expect demand for Mobile and Embedded Devices based on Windows Mobile software to continue to be driven by an overall increase in customer demand for connectivity as well as an increase in the number of new Windows Mobile based devices being offered by OEMs and mobile operators.

Home and Entertainment includes the Microsoft Xbox video game console system, PC games, the Home Products Division (HPD), and TV platform products for the interactive television industry. The relative success of competing video game consoles is determined by console functionality, the portfolio of video game content for the console, and the relative market share of the console. We are a relatively new entrant in the video game console business with our first release in fiscal 2002, and have already established ourselves as one of the leaders. Revenue and unit volumes have grown quickly since 2002, but revenue growth moderated in fiscal 2004 due to price reductions typical at this later stage in the console lifecycle. We believe our competitive position and revenue is bolstered by our increasing software game attach rates, providing higher margins to offset the decreasing price trend on consoles sold. Currently, Xbox consoles have negative gross margins.
 
In the three months ended September 30, 2004, Xbox revenue increased $71 million or 23% with $129 million related to higher Xbox software and console volumes as compared with the first quarter of the prior fiscal year. This was partially offset by a $58 million decline related to price reductions of Xbox consoles and software. Xbox console volumes increased 4% in the three months ended September 30, 2004 compared to fiscal 2004. The Xbox life-to-date U.S. games attach rate increased to 7.3 games per console according to industry analyst NPD as of September 30, 2004. Revenue from consumer hardware and software, PC games and TV platforms declined $20 million or 7% compared to fiscal 2004 due to lower PC games software sales.
 
The decrease in operating loss in the three months ended September 30, 2004 was primarily due to an increase in Xbox software volumes and a reduction in headcount related costs, primarily associated with a $19 million decline in stock-based compensation. This was partially offset by an increase in costs associated with the next generation console development efforts. Operating expenses continue to be driven by investment in the next generation Xbox platform design, sales and marketing efforts directed towards holiday season promotions, and headcount-related costs.

Table of Contents

We continue to expect annual Xbox console unit volumes and revenue to decrease from fiscal 2004 consistent with this stage of the Xbox console lifecycle, offset by increased software unit volumes primarily driven by the launch of software titles such as Halo2, which is expected to be launched on November 9. In fiscal 2005 we expect PC games revenue to decrease from fiscal 2004 as a result of fewer new game titles. In fiscal 2005, we expect operating margins to improve from fiscal 2004 driven by increased sales of high margin software.

Cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products and programs sold, operation costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, and costs associated with the delivery of consulting services. The decrease in the three months ended September 30, 2004 was primarily driven by a reduction in costs associated with MSN Internet Access and a reduction in headcount-related costs primarily associated with a $40 million decline in stock-based compensation. This was partially offset by increased costs in product support and consulting services.

Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Research and development expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 decreased due to a $136 million decline in stock-based compensation costs. This was partially offset by an increase in product development costs associated with upcoming products, primarily the next generation of Xbox console, SQL Server 2005—code named “Yukon” and other server products.

The reduction in stock-based compensation expense was partially offset by costs associated with an increase in headcount.

Dividends and interest income declined $73 million to $411 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 as compared to the corresponding quarter in fiscal 2004 due to a higher allocation of funds to lower yielding, more liquid asset classes. Net realized gains on investments declined to $53 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 compared to $245 million in the first quarter of the prior year resulting from fewer sales of investments. Net realized gains on investments includes other-than-temporary impairments of $23 million in the three months ended September 30, 2004 compared to $18 million in comparable period in fiscal 2004. Net derivative losses were $195 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 compared to net gains of $34 million in the comparable quarter of the prior year resulting primarily from interest rate and foreign currency related instruments. Derivative instruments are used to manage exposures to interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency markets. During the first quarter of fiscal 2005, losses related to interest rate derivatives used to economically hedge against a rise in interest rates were $75 million resulting from a decline in longer-term interest rates. These losses were offset by unrealized gains related to an increase in the market value of fixed income securities included as a component of other comprehensive income. Also during the first quarter of 2005, losses related to foreign currency contracts were $105 million, related in part to hedging anticipated foreign currency revenues while the dollar generally declined against most currencies (except the yen), as well as economically hedging foreign currency based investment exposures. Losses related to hedging foreign currency based investment exposures were offset by unrealized gains in the underlying assets. In the first quarter of fiscal 2004, losses related to foreign currency and interest rate sensitive contracts were not significant. Net losses on equity investees and other for the prior period were reclassified into investment income and other to conform to the current period presentation.

Our effective tax rate for the first quarter in both fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005 was 33%.
 
FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
Cash and short-term investments totaled $64.42 billion as of September 30, 2004 compared to $60.59 billion as of June 30, 2004. Equity and other investments were $12.19 billion as of September 30, 2004 compared to $12.21 billion as of June 30, 2004. The portfolio consists primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S. dollar denominated securities, but also includes foreign currency positions in order to diversify financial risk. The portfolio is primarily invested in short-term securities to minimize interest rate risk and facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs.
 
Unearned Revenue
 
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product’s life cycle.
 
Unearned revenue as of September 30, 2004 decreased $395 million from June 30, 2004, reflecting recognition of unearned revenue from multi-year licensing that has outpaced additions by $270 million, and a $96 million decline in revenue deferred for undelivered elements. We earned approximately $379 million and $37 million from the Upgrade Advantage programs for the three months ended September 30, 2003 and 2004, respectively, and do not expect to earn a meaningful amount of revenue in the future.
 
The following table outlines the expected recognition of $7.78 billion of unearned revenue at September 30, 2004:

Cash Flows
 
Cash flow from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2004 increased $583 million from the first quarter of fiscal 2004 to $4.01 billion, due to a $306 million decrease in impact of deferred revenue and other changes in working capital. Cash used for financing was $738 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, an increase of $388 million from the corresponding period in fiscal 2004. The increase reflects the $870 million cash dividend paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The increase was partially offset by the impact of cash used

Table of Contents

for common stock repurchases of $355 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 compared to $1.05 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. Cash used for investing was $8.11 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, an increase of $4.37 billion from the first quarter of fiscal 2004, due to a $4.36 billion increase in combined investment purchases, sales and maturities combined with the effect of purchasing more highly liquid securities considered cash equivalents during the prior quarter.
 
We have no material long-term debt. Stockholders’ equity at September 30, 2004 was $75.95 billion. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices. We have issued residual value guarantees in connection with various operating leases. These guarantees provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value. As of September 30, 2004, the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately $271 million. We believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability currently exists. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources.
 
On July 20, 2004, our board of directors approved a one-time special dividend of $3.00 per share, or approximately $33 billion, subject to shareholder approval of stock plan amendments that will allow certain adjustments to employee stock-based compensation awards to offset the impact of the special dividend. The special dividend will be payable on December 2, 2004, to shareholders of record on November 17, 2004, conditioned upon shareholder approval of amendments to the employee stock plans at the annual meeting of shareholders scheduled to be held November 9, 2004. The board also approved a plan to buy back up to $30 billion in Microsoft common stock over the next four years. The specific timing and amount of repurchases will vary based on market conditions, securities law limitations, and other factors. The repurchases will be made using our cash resources. During the first quarter of fiscal 2005, we repurchased 22.8 million shares for $625 million under this announced plan. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
 
On September 15, 2004, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share. The dividend is payable December 2, 2004, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 17, 2004. The ex-dividend date is November 15, 2004.
 
We believe existing cash and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements and our special dividend as well as regular quarterly dividends. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short-term investments, as well as equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We continuously assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.
 
Off-balance sheet arrangements
 
We have unconditionally guaranteed the repayment of certain Japanese yen denominated bank loans and related interest and fees of Jupiter Telecommunication, Ltd., a Japanese cable company (Jupiter). These guarantees arose on February 1, 2003 in conjunction with the expiration of prior financing arrangements, including previous guarantees by us. The financing arrangements were entered into by Jupiter as part of financing its operations. As part of Jupiter’s new financing agreement, we agreed to guarantee repayment by Jupiter of the loans of approximately $51 million. The estimated fair value and the carrying value of the guarantees was $11 million and
 
23
Table of Contents

did not result in a charge to operations. The guarantees are in effect until the earlier of either repayment of the loans, including accrued interest and fees, or February 1, 2009. The maximum amount of the guarantees is limited to the sum of the total due and unpaid principal amounts, accrued and unpaid interest, and any other related expenses. Additionally, the maximum amount of the guarantees, denominated in Japanese yen, will vary based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. If we were required to make payments under the guarantees, we might recover all or a portion of those payments upon liquidation of Jupiter’s assets. The proceeds from an asset liquidation cannot be accurately estimated due to the many factors that would affect the valuation and realization of the proceeds.
 
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by FIN 45. We consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements.
 
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
 
In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 03-1-1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10–20 of EITF Issue No. 03-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments”, which delays the effective date for the recognition and measurement guidance in EITF Issue No. 03-1. In addition, the FASB has issued a proposed FSP to consider whether further application guidance is necessary for securities analyzed for impairment under EITF Issue No. 03-1. We continue to assess the potential impact that the adoption of the proposed FSP could have on our financial statements.
 
In July 2004, the FASB ratified EITF consensus on Issue No. 02-14, “Whether an Investor Should Apply the Equity Method of Accounting to Investments Other Than Common Stock”, which provides guidance regarding application of the equity method of accounting to investments other than common stock. EITF Issue No. 02-14 will be effective beginning with our second quarter of fiscal 2005. We do not believe the adoption of EITF Issue No. 02-14 will have a material impact on our financial statements.
 
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, and accounting for income taxes.
 
We account for the licensing of software in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. The application of SOP 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for those elements. Customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. These elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, the fair value of which is recognized over the product’s estimated life cycle. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.

Table of Contents

SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 59, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other factors, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost; the financial health of and near-term business outlook for the investee, including factors such as industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow; and our intent and ability to hold the investment. Investments with an indicator are further evaluated to determine the likelihood of a significant adverse affect on the fair value and amount of the impairment as necessary. If market, industry and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
 
SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (July 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.
 
We account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including SFAS 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, and SFAS 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material, and accordingly, we expense all research and development costs when incurred.
 
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations.
 
SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations

Management Summary
 
Overview
 
The state of the global economy is an important factor in evaluating our third quarter results. Growth in major world economies has led to an increase in demand and spending for information technology products and services, including increased demand for personal computers, server hardware, software and gaming consoles compared to a year ago. In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, we also benefited from an increase in spending on Internet-based advertising as well as the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar versus major foreign currencies over the prior year period. While we expect these improvements to continue through our fiscal fourth quarter, competition remains intense from both commercial and non-commercial software products and litigation remains a general risk in the intellectual property business, and a specific risk for Microsoft.

The revenue growth for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 resulted primarily from increased licensing of Windows operating systems through OEMs, Office 2003 and Server products, and MSN advertising revenue. Foreign exchange rates also contributed nearly 5% growth in total revenue for the quarter due to generally stronger foreign currency rates versus the U.S. dollar.
 
During the third quarter, continued strong PC and Server shipment growth and improved IT spending compared to fiscal 2003 contributed to our overall revenue growth. We estimate that total PC shipments grew approximately 14% from the third quarter of the prior year driven by strong business demand in both mature and emerging markets with consumer shipments growth of approximately 10% for the quarter. Total server hardware shipments have grown 17% in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 per our internal projections, with Windows Server shipments growing faster than the overall sector at 25% compared to the prior year’s third quarter. The net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in the third quarter compared to a year ago, primarily due to a stronger Euro and Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. Had the rates from the prior year’s third quarter been in effect in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, translated international revenue earned in local currencies would have been approximately $350 million lower. Certain manufacturing, selling, distribution, and support costs are disbursed in local currencies, and a portion of international revenue is hedged, thus offsetting a portion of the translation exposure.

The revenue growth for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 was driven partly by revenue recognized from multi-year licensing that occurred prior to the Company’s transition to a new licensing program (Licensing 6.0) in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and strong OEM licensing of Microsoft Windows XP Home and Professional operating systems and Server products as a result of growth in PC and server hardware shipments. Prior to the July 31, 2002 transition date to Licensing 6.0, we experienced a significant increase in multi-year licensing arrangements as customers enrolled in the Company’s maintenance programs, primarily Upgrade Advantage. The increase in revenue was also driven by a 14% growth in estimated PC shipments, reflecting strength in the consumer segment as well as global economic improvement driving enterprise segment replacement PC and notebook sales. We estimate that total server hardware shipments grew 15%, with Windows Server shipments growing faster than the overall sector at 19% in the first nine months of fiscal 2004. The net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in the first nine months of fiscal 2004, primarily due to a stronger Euro and Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. Had the rates from the prior year’s first nine months been in effect in the first nine months of fiscal 2004, translated international revenue earned in local currencies would have been approximately $830 million lower. Certain manufacturing, selling, distribution, and support costs are disbursed in local currencies, and a portion of international revenue is hedged, thus offsetting a portion of the translation exposure.
 
For the full fiscal 2004, we expect PC shipments to grow at rates in the low teens, driven by both consumer and business demand for PCs. We believe the overall server hardware sector and IT spending outlook will continue to demonstrate improvement over fiscal 2003. Our enterprise server products revenue results should be positively affected by the continued shift to lower cost X86 server architecture. As a result, we expect overall server hardware shipment growth for fiscal 2004 to reach near mid-teens growth with Windows Server operating systems licenses growing faster than the overall sector. We believe foreign exchange rates will continue to stabilize during the last quarter of our fiscal year and we will continue to benefit from the U.S. dollar’s position relative to the Euro and Japanese yen.
 
The operating income decline for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 was due primarily to a $1.92 billion charge related to settlement of the Sun Microsystems litigation and a €497 million ($605 million) accrual for the European Commission fine. Sun Microsystems and Microsoft entered into a series of agreements that settled Sun’s suit against us and resolved other legal claims between the companies. The European Commission fine was imposed as part of its finding that Microsoft had infringed European competition law by refusing to supply work group server interoperability information and by including streaming media playback functioning in Windows desktop operating systems. We intend to appeal the European Commission’s finding.
 
For the first nine months of fiscal 2004, the operating income decline was primarily driven by the $2.53 billion of charges related to the settlement of the Sun Microsystems litigation and an accrual for the fine imposed by the European Commission and $2.21 billion of stock-based compensation expense related to our employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004.
 
We adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, on July 1, 2003 and restated prior periods to reflect compensation cost under the recognition provisions of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees after July 1, 1995. Stock-based compensation is included in operating expenses as part of headcount-related costs. Total stock-based compensation costs included in operating expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 were $748 million, compared to $978 million in the prior year’s comparable quarter. Total stock-based compensation costs included in operating expenses for the nine months ended March 31, 2004 were $5.00 billion, compared to $3.08 billion in the prior year’s comparable period.

Client includes revenue from Windows XP Professional and Home, Windows 2000 Professional, and other standard Windows operating systems. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2004 Windows OEM license units grew 16%, driving an 18% growth in OEM revenue compared to the prior year. Revenue from commercial and retail licensing grew 6% compared to the prior year’s third quarter. The mix of Windows units shipped with the Professional version increased two percentage points to 58% of total Windows licenses compared to the prior year. Client operating income in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 declined primarily as a result of $700 million of legal settlement expenses related to the Sun Microsystems litigation, partially offset by growth in revenue.
 
The nine month revenue growth reflected Windows OEM license unit growth of 12%, driving a 16% growth in OEM revenue compared to the prior year. Revenue from commercial and retail licensing declined 1% compared to the prior year’s first nine months. Client operating income for the first nine months of fiscal year 2004 declined due to growth in operating expenses, primarily related to legal settlement expenses of $700 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 and stock-based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, partially offset by growth in revenue.
 
We anticipate that total PC shipments will grow about 10% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, continuing to influence our growth in Client revenue. Additionally, we do not expect significant future changes in the mix of Windows Home and the higher priced Windows Professional version.

Server and Tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (CALs) for Windows Server, SQL Server, Exchange Server, and other servers. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier product support services, and Microsoft consulting services. In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, Server revenue, including CALs, grew $445 million or 36%. The revenue increase was driven primarily by an estimated 25% increase in Windows-based server shipments resulting in 31% growth in new Windows Server license sales as well as growth in SQL Server and Core CAL revenue. Consulting and Premier

product support services increased $30 million or 11% compared to the prior year’s third quarter. Revenue from developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press and other services decreased $125 million or 38%, due to recognition of $128 million of previously deferred revenue in the prior year’s comparable quarter. The third quarter of fiscal 2004 operating income declined $940 million primarily due to $1.22 billion of legal settlement expenses related to the Sun Microsystems litigation, partially offset by the increase in revenue.
 
In the first nine months of fiscal 2004, Server revenue, including CALs, grew $950 million or 25% driven primarily by an estimated 19% increase in Windows-based server shipments driving growth in new Windows Server license sales as well as growth in SQL Server and Exchange Server revenue. Consulting and Premier product support services increased $137 million or 19% compared to the prior year’s first nine months. Revenue from developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press and other services declined $125 million or 17% compared to the prior year’s first nine months. Server and Tools operating income for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 decreased primarily due to a legal settlement charge of $1.22 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 and stock-based compensation costs from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004.

Information Worker includes Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, SharePoint Portal Server CALs, other information worker products including Microsoft LiveMeeting and OneNote, and professional product support services. Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 reflected continued momentum from the Office 2003 launch. Benefiting from increased adoption of Office 2003 including penetration of the premium Small Business and Professional editions, OEM licensing revenue grew 35% compared to the prior year’s third quarter. Revenue from volume licensing, retail packaged product and pre- installed versions of Office in Japan also grew 15% in aggregate as Office 2003 sales strength continued post launch. Contributing to the increase in revenue was previously deferred multi-year licensing arrangements revenue, including Upgrade Advantage, and a lower deferral rate for undelivered elements, partially offset by lengthened product lives. Information Worker operating income for the third quarter of fiscal year 2004 increased due to the growth in revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, primarily headcount-related costs and marketing expenses in the Small and Mid-Market Solutions and Partners group.
 
Revenue growth for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 from volume licensing, retail packaged product and pre installed versions of Office in Japan is 13% in aggregate, driven by recognitions of unearned revenue from a large increase in multi-year licenses signed prior to the transition to our Licensing 6.0 programs and the release of Office 2003. OEM licensing revenue grew 33%. Information Worker operating income in the first nine months of fiscal year 2004 increased from the prior year primarily due to growth in revenue, largely offset by an increase in operating expenses, primarily related to the stock-based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 and higher sales and marketing expenses.

Microsoft Business Solutions includes Microsoft Great Plains, Microsoft Navision, Microsoft Axapta, Microsoft Solomon, Microsoft CRM, bCentral and other business applications and services. The revenue increase in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 was primarily attributable to continued growth in licensing of Navision and Axapta products outside of the United States as well as the timing of licensing agreements. Microsoft Business Solutions operating loss for the third quarter of fiscal year 2004 declined due to growth in revenue and lower stock-based compensation expense partially offset by increased sales and marketing costs.
 
The revenue increase in the first nine months of fiscal 2004 was primarily attributable to continued growth in licensing of Navision and Axapta products.

MSN includes MSN subscriptions and the MSN network of Internet products and services. In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, MSN Network services revenue grew $100 million or 43% as a result of growth in paid search and growth in the overall Internet advertising market. MSN subscription revenue declined $17 million or 6% as the number of narrowband subscribers continued to migrate to competitively priced broadband or other ISPs. The number of total MSN subscriptions at the end of March 2004 was 8.2 million, slightly higher than at the end of December 2003, as the loss of narrowband subscribers was offset by the gain of other premium service subscriptions. Subscription revenue may decline in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year as the narrowband subscriber base is expected to continue to decline. The improvement in operating income/(loss) in the third quarter was due to strong advertising revenue and paid search, while operation costs remained flat and customer acquisition expenditures declined.
 
In the first nine months of fiscal 2004, MSN Network services grew $274 million or 47% as a result of increased Internet advertising revenue. MSN Subscription revenue declined $40 million or 5%, reflecting a decrease in the overall subscriber base. The improvement in operating results for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 was driven primarily by strong advertising revenue performance and lower operating expenses including a $48 million one-time refund of prior year taxes, partially offset by the costs related to the employee stock option transfer program which were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2004.

Mobile and Embedded Devices includes Windows Mobile software, Windows Embedded device operating systems, MapPoint, and Windows Automotive. The increase in revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 was driven by growth in all businesses. The revenue growth realized by MapPoint has slowed and is expected to grow at a continued slower pace in future quarters, as the first two quarters of fiscal 2004 growth rates reflected the

Home and Entertainment includes the Xbox video game system, PC games, consumer software and hardware, and TV platform. Xbox revenue increased $81 million or 35% from the prior year’s third quarter, with $78 million related to higher volumes of Xbox software and $39 million due to higher Xbox console volumes, partially offset by a $36 million decline related to past price reductions of Xbox consoles and software. At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2004, we announced a price reduction for the Xbox console in the United States. Overall, Xbox console volumes increased 30% in the third quarter compared to the prior year’s comparable quarter. This increase was partially attributed to low inventory levels of competitive consoles. Xbox’s life to date U.S. games attach rate according to NPD data was 6.8 games per console. Revenue from consumer hardware and software, PC games and TV platforms declined $4 million or 2% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2003 due to lower PC games software and PC gaming devices sales.
 
Home and Entertainment operating loss for the third quarter of fiscal year 2004 improved from the third quarter of fiscal year 2003 driven by revenue growth and improved Xbox console and third party software margins as well as lower marketing costs.
 
Xbox revenue increased $149 million or 11% from the prior year’s first nine months, with $255 million related to higher volumes of Xbox software and $85 million due to higher Xbox console volumes offset by a $191 million decrease related to price reductions of Xbox consoles and software. Xbox console volumes increased 9%. Revenue from consumer hardware and software, PC games and TV platforms declined $37 million or 4% compared to the prior year’s first nine months due to a decline in revenue from PC gaming devices.
 
Home and Entertainment operating loss for the first nine months of fiscal year 2004 improved from the first nine months of fiscal year 2003 driven by growth in revenue and only a 2% growth in operating expenses, including stock-based compensation costs associated with the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004.

Cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products and programs sold, operation costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, and costs associated with the delivery of consulting services. The increase in absolute dollars in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 resulted from an increase in product support and consulting services costs and Home & Entertainment costs related to increased Xbox console units sold, partially offset by lower costs of producing the Xbox console. The absolute dollar cost of revenue growth in the first nine months of fiscal 2004 was primarily driven by stock-based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program and an increase in product support and consulting services.

Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. The decrease in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 was primarily due to lower headcount-related costs driven by reductions in stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by increased product development costs. The increase in the first nine months of fiscal 2004 was primarily due to stock-based compensation expenses including expenses related to the option transfer program recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 and $164 million or 7% in other headcount-related costs.

General and administrative costs include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation and other headcount-related costs associated with the finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources, and other administrative headcount, and legal costs and other administrative fees. General and administrative in the third quarter included $1.92 billion of charges related to the settlement of the Sun Microsystems litigation and a $605 million accrual for the European Commission fine. The increase in the first nine months of fiscal 2004 was primarily due to legal settlement expenses and stock-based compensation expense related to the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004.

Dividends and interest income was relatively consistent for the comparable three and nine month periods. Net gains (losses) on investments include other-than-temporary impairments of $5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to $234 million in the third quarter of the prior year, and $66 million for the nine month period ended March 31, 2004 compared to $1.09 billion in the prior year comparable period. The decline in impairments was mainly due to improved market conditions. Realized gains from investments increased to $424 million compared to $236 million in the third quarter of the prior year, and were $1.04 billion compared to $859 million in the nine month period of the prior year. Net losses on derivative instruments of $368 million for the nine month period ended March 31, 2003 were driven mainly by the impact of declining interest rates on interest rate sensitive instruments during the first quarter of fiscal 2003.
 
INCOME TAXES
 
The effective tax rate for the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2004 is approximately 42% and 35%. The increase in the effective tax rate for the third quarter and for the full fiscal year 2004 reflects the impact of the accrual for the European Commission fine, which is not tax deductible. Excluding the effect of the European Commission fine, the tax rate for the quarter would have been 33%. The effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 35% for fiscal 2004. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 was 32%, reflecting a benefit in the second quarter of $126 million from the reversal of previously accrued taxes.

Effective July 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, using the retroactive restatement method described in SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, stock-based

compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. The June 30, 2003 balance sheet has been restated for the retroactive adoption of the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 which resulted in a $13.89 billion increase in common stock and paid-in capital, a $10.00 billion decrease in retained earnings, and a $3.89 billion increase in deferred income taxes.
 
In fiscal year 2004, we implemented changes in employee compensation designed to help us continue to attract and retain the best employees, and to better align employee interests with those of our shareholders. Employees are now granted stock awards instead of stock options. The stock award program offers employees the opportunity to earn shares of our stock over time, rather than options that give employees the right to purchase stock at a set price. We also completed an employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 whereby employees could elect to transfer all of their vested and unvested stock options with a strike price of $33 or higher (“eligible options”) to JPMorgan. The unvested eligible options that were transferred to JPMorgan became vested upon the transfer. The price paid by JPMorgan for the transferred options was determined by reference to the arithmetic average of the closing prices of Microsoft common stock during the period from November 14, 2003 to December 8, 2003, which was $25.5720.
 
A total of 18,503 (51%) of the 36,539 eligible Microsoft employees elected to participate in the stock option transfer program and 344.6 million (55%) of the 621.4 million eligible options were tendered. Under the terms of the program, JPMorgan paid Microsoft $382 million for the transferred options. Microsoft made an initial payment of $219 million to participating employees for the transferred options, with a remaining portion to be paid in one or more payments that are subject to participating employees’ continued employment over the next two or three years. The options that were transferred to JPMorgan resulted in stock-based compensation expense of $2.21 billion ($1.48 billion after-tax or $0.14 per diluted share) in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. This expense consists of the unrecognized compensation costs of the options that were transferred, less the amounts payable applicable to those previously unvested options that are subject to continued employment of participating employees. The contingent payments applicable to unvested eligible options that are subject to continued employment of participating employees will be recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the contingent payments.
 
The stock option transfer program also resulted in a decrease to our long-term deferred tax assets due to the excess of recorded compensation expense for these options over the related tax deduction reported on our tax return. For the nine months ended March 31, 2004, deferred tax assets were reduced by approximately $2.01 billion with an offsetting reduction in paid-in capital, reflecting the reduction of previously recorded deductions reported on our tax return in excess of stock-based compensation expense.
 
FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
Cash and short-term investments totaled $56.41 billion as of March 31, 2004 compared to $49.05 billion as of June 30, 2003. The portfolio consists primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade securities. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S. dollar denominated securities, but also includes foreign currency positions, in order to diversify financial risk.
 
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product’s life cycle. The percentage of revenue recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements ranges from approximately 15% to 25% of the sales price for Windows XP Home, approximately 5% to 15% of the sales price for Windows XP Professional, and approximately 1% to 15% of the sales price for desktop applications, depending on the terms and conditions of the license and prices of the elements. Product life cycles are currently

Table of Contents

estimated at three and a half years for Windows operating systems and two years for desktop applications. Unearned revenue also includes payments for online advertising for which the advertisement has yet to be displayed and payments for post-delivery support services to be performed in the future.
 
Unearned revenue as of March 31, 2004 decreased $326 million from December 31, 2003. The sequential decrease reflected a $123 million net decrease in unearned revenue related to undelivered elements as deferral rates were lower, partially offset by lengthened product life cycles for the underlying products licensed, resulting in a higher proportion of revenue earned. The sequential decline also reflects a net decrease of $248 million in unearned revenue from volume licensing programs as $261 million of revenue was earned from previously deferred revenue from Upgrade Advantage programs.
 
Unearned revenue as of March 31, 2004 decreased $1.49 billion from June 30, 2003. The sequential decrease reflected a $346 million net decrease in unearned revenue related to undelivered elements as deferral rates were lower, partially offset by lengthened product life cycles for the underlying products licensed, resulting in a higher proportion of revenue earned. The decline also reflects a net decrease of $1.14 billion in unearned revenue from volume licensing programs as $936 million of revenue was earned from previously deferred revenue from Upgrade Advantage programs.
 
The revenue earned from the Upgrade Advantage programs for fiscal years 2003 and 2004 was as follows (in millions):

Cash flow from operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 was $4.97 billion, compared to $4.17 billion in the comparable quarter of the prior year. The increase reflects higher net income before non-cash items including stock-based compensation expense and legal charges, and other changes in working capital. Cash used for financing was $1.04 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to $1.21 billion in the comparable quarter of the prior year. Cash used in the prior year’s comparable quarter included a cash dividend payment of $857 million. We also repurchased 49.9 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to 30.7 million shares repurchased in the prior year’s third quarter. Cash used for investing was $738 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to $4.21 billion in the prior year’s third quarter. The decrease reflects the decline in purchases of investments partially offset by impact of other investing activities.
 
Cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 will be affected by the cash payment of certain legal charges accrued in the third quarter of fiscal 2004.
 
Cash flow from operations was $12.97 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2004, a decrease of $140 million from the first nine months of the prior year. The decrease reflects the decline in net income due to stock-based compensation and accrued legal fees, the impact of net recognized gains on investments and the impact of accounts receivable, partially offset by the rise in other current and long-term liabilities. Cash used for financing was $3.66 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2004, a decrease of $1.08 billion from the first nine months of the prior year, reflecting a decrease of approximately $1.89 billion in stock repurchases partially offset by an

Table of Contents

increase in cash dividends of $872 million. During the first nine months of fiscal 2004, we repurchased 123.7 million shares of common stock, compared to 190.1 million shares of common stock in the comparable period of the prior year. The decrease in net cash used for investing for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 reflects the impact of $891 million in cash acquisition costs in the prior year.
 
We have no material long-term debt. Stockholders’ equity at March 31, 2004 was $70.58 billion. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities and computer systems for R&D, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. Commitments for constructing new buildings were $148 million on March 31, 2004. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources.
 
We believe existing cash and short-term investments together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short-term investments, as well as equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We continuously assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.
 
Off-balance sheet arrangements
 
We have unconditionally guaranteed the repayment of certain Japanese Yen denominated bank loans and related interest and fees of Jupiter Telecommunication, Ltd., a Japanese cable company (Jupiter). These guarantees arose on February 1, 2003 in conjunction with the expiration of prior financing arrangements, including previous guarantees by us. The financing arrangements were entered into by Jupiter as part of financing its operations. As part of Jupiter’s new financing agreement, we agreed to guarantee repayment by Jupiter of the loans of approximately $55 million. The estimated fair value and the carrying value of the guarantees was $10.5 million and did not result in a charge to operations. The guarantees are in effect until the earlier of repayment of the loans, including accrued interest and fees, or February 1, 2009. The maximum amount of the guarantees is limited to the sum of the total due and unpaid principal amounts, accrued and unpaid interest, and any other related expenses. Additionally, the maximum amount of the guarantees, denominated in Japanese yen, will vary based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. If we were required to make payments under the guarantees, we may recover all or a portion of those payments upon liquidation of Jupiter’s assets. The proceeds from such liquidation cannot be accurately estimated due to the multitude of factors that would affect the valuation and realization of the proceeds in the event of liquidation.
 
In connection with various operating leases, we issued residual value guarantees, which provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value. As of March 31, 2004, the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately $271 million. We believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability to us currently exists.
 
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. In addition, we also provide indemnification against credit risk in several geographical locations to our volume license resellers in case the resellers fail to collect from the end user. Due to the nature of the indemnification provided to our resellers, we can not estimate the fair value, nor determine the total nominal amount of the indemnification. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS 5 as interpreted by FASB Interpretation 45, Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
 
28
Table of Contents

Others (FIN 45). We consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements.
 
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
 
In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation 46R (FIN 46R), a revision to Interpretation 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46R clarifies some of the provisions of FIN 46 and exempts certain entities from its requirements. FIN 46R is effective at the end of the first interim period ending after March 15, 2004. Entities that have adopted FIN 46 prior to this effective date can continue to apply the provisions of FIN 46 until the effective date of FIN 46R or elect early adoption of FIN46R. Microsoft adopted FIN 46 on July 1, 2003 and FIN 46R for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 .and it did not have a material impact on our financial statements. The early adoption of FIN46R did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
 
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, accounting for stock-based compensation, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, and accounting for income taxes.
 
We account for the licensing of software in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. The application of SOP 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for those elements. End users receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. These elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, the fair value of which is recognized over the product’s estimated life cycle. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.
 
We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123. The application of SFAS 123 requires judgment, including the expected life and stock price volatility for stock options and expected dividends and forfeitures for all stock-based awards. Changes in the expected or actual outcome of forfeitures due to service- and/or performance-related conditions could materially impact the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized.
 
SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 59, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other factors, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost; the financial health of and near-term business outlook for the investee, including factors such as industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow; and our intent and ability to hold the investment.
 
SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (July 1st for
 
29
Table of Contents

Microsoft) and between annual tests in certain circumstances. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. Significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.
 
We account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including SFAS 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, and SFAS 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in creating a computer software product should be charged to expense when incurred as research and development until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material, and accordingly, we expense all research and development costs when incurred.
 
We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. We evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations.
 
SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) contains statements that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in “Issues and Uncertainties” and elsewhere in this report. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statement to conform the statement to actual results or changes in our expectations.
 
Management Summary
 
Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 was $10.15 billion, an increase of 19% over the second quarter of fiscal year 2003. The revenue growth was driven primarily by licensing of the recently launched Office 2003, increased licensing of Windows operating systems through OEMs and Server and Tools products, and 19% growth in MSN revenue.
 
During the second quarter, the continued strong PC shipment growth influenced our overall revenue growth. We estimate that total PC shipments grew 12% from the second quarter of the prior year reflecting strength in the consumer segment and notebook sales. We also observed an improvement in overall IT spending. We estimate that total server hardware shipments grew 13%, with Windows Server shipments growing faster than the overall sector at 19% in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. The net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in the second quarter compared to a year ago, primarily due to a stronger Euro and Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. Had the rates from the prior year’s second quarter been in effect in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, translated international revenue earned in local currencies would have been approximately $312 million lower. Certain manufacturing, selling, distribution, and support costs are disbursed in local currencies, and a portion of international revenue is hedged, thus offsetting a portion of the translation exposure.
 
Revenue for the first six months of fiscal year 2004 was $18.37 billion, an increase of 13% over the first six months of fiscal year 2003. The revenue growth was driven by 13% growth in estimated PC shipments, reflecting strength primarily in the consumer segment and notebook sales. We estimate that total server hardware shipments grew 12%, with Windows Server shipments growing faster than the overall sector at 16% in the first six months of fiscal 2004. The revenue growth was also driven by revenue recognized from multi-year licensing that occurred prior to the Company’s transition to its new licensing program (Licensing 6.0) in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Prior to the July 31, 2002 transition date to Licensing 6.0, the Company experienced a significant growth in multi-year licensing arrangements as customers enrolled in the Company’s maintenance programs, primarily Upgrade Advantage programs and Enterprise Agreements.
 
Unearned revenue as of December 31, 2003 decreased $1.16 billion from June 30, 2003. The decrease reflected a $223 million decrease in unearned revenue related to undelivered elements as deferral rates were lowered and product life cycles lengthened for the underlying products licensed in the first half of fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003, resulting in a higher proportion of revenue earned. The decline also reflects a net decrease of $893 million in unearned revenue from volume licensing programs as $675 million of revenue was earned from previously deferred revenue from Upgrade Advantage programs.
 
The net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in the first six months of fiscal 2004, primarily due to a stronger Euro and Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. Had the rates from the prior year’s first six months been in effect in the first six months of fiscal 2004, translated international revenue earned in local currencies would have been approximately $477 million lower. Certain manufacturing, selling, distribution, and support costs are disbursed in local currencies, and a portion of international revenue is hedged, thus offsetting a portion of the translation exposure.
 
For the full fiscal 2004, PC shipments are expected to grow at double digit rates. In the second half of the fiscal year, we expect PC market growth to be driven by both consumer and business demand for PCs. We believe the overall server hardware sector and IT spending outlook is improving. Our enterprise server products

Table of Contents

revenue results should be positively influenced by the continued shift to lower cost X86 server architecture. As a result, we expect overall server hardware shipment growth for fiscal 2004 to reach double digit growth with Windows Server operating systems licenses growing faster than the overall sector. We believe foreign exchange rates will stabilize during the second half of our fiscal year and we will continue to benefit from the U.S. dollar’s position relative to the Euro and Japanese yen in the second half of the fiscal year.
 
Consolidated operating income of $1.48 billion declined 34% for the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 due primarily to $2.21 billion in stock based compensation expenses related to our employee stock option transfer program completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Increased marketing, legal costs, and employee-related costs associated with additional headcount also contributed to the increase in operating expenses.
 
Consolidated operating income of $4.62 billion declined 12% for the first six months of fiscal year 2004 due primarily to $2.21 billion in stock based compensation expenses related to our employee stock option transfer program completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Increased legal costs and employee-related costs associated with additional headcount also contributed to the increase in operating expenses.
 
We adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, on July 1, 2003 and restated prior periods to reflect compensation cost under the recognition provisions of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees after July 1, 1995. Headcount-related costs in operating expenses include stock-based compensation. Total stock-based compensation costs included in operating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 were $3.23 billion, compared to $1.06 billion in the prior year’s comparable quarter and $4.25 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2004, compared to $2.11 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2003.

Client
 
Client revenue was $3.06 billion in the second quarter, growing 21% from the second quarter of the prior year. Client includes revenue from Windows XP Professional and Home, Windows 2000 Professional, and other standard Windows operating systems. Windows OEM license units grew 27%, driving a 26% growth in OEM revenue compared to the prior year. The mix of Windows units shipped with the Professional version remained steady at 55% of total Windows licenses compared to the prior year. In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we completed our transition to new licensing terms under which OEMs are billed for products when Certificates of Authenticity (COAs) are acquired rather than upon PC shipment, which resulted in reported licenses in the second quarter of the prior year to be unusually low as some OEMs accumulated inventory at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Revenue from commercial and retail licensing grew 4% compared to the prior year’s second quarter. Client operating income for the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 grew 6% compared to the second quarter of the prior year as a result of 21% growth in revenue partially offset by 70% growth in operating expenses, primarily from $307 million of stock based compensation expense related to the employee stock option transfer program, other headcount-related costs, and a $60 million settlement charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2004.
 
Client revenue was $5.87 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2004, representing 10% growth from the first six months of the prior year. The six month revenue growth reflected Windows OEM license units growth of 13%, driving a 14% growth in OEM revenue compared to the prior year. The mix of Windows units shipped with the Professional version decreased to 58% from 59% of total Windows licenses in the first six months of the prior year as OEM shipments of consumer PCs grew at a faster rate than business PCs in the first six months of fiscal 2004. Revenue from commercial and retail licensing declined 5% compared to the prior year’s first six months. Client operating income for the first six months of fiscal year 2004 grew 2% compared to the first six months of the prior year due to 10% growth in revenue partially offset by 39% growth in operating expenses, primarily related to the stock based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program, headcount-related costs, and a settlement charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2004.
 
We anticipate that total PC shipments will grow at double digit rates for the rest of fiscal 2004, continuing to influence our growth in Client revenue. We do not expect a significant incremental shift toward our higher priced Windows Professional version.
 
Server and Tools
 
Server and Tools revenue grew 21% to $2.13 billion in the second quarter. Server and Tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (CALs) for Windows Server, SQL Server, Exchange Server, and other servers. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier product support services, and Microsoft consulting services. Server revenue, including CALs, grew $290 million or 22% driven primarily by an estimated 19% increase in Windows-based server shipments driving 17% growth in new Windows Server license sales as well as growth in SQL Server and Exchange Server revenue. Consulting and Premier product support services increased $70 million or 29% compared to the prior year’s second quarter.

Revenue from developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press and other services grew $11 million or 5%. Server and Tools reported an operating loss of $204 million in the second quarter of 2004, compared to operating income of $234 million in the second quarter of the prior year. While revenue increased 21%, Server and Tools reported an operating loss because of stock based compensation costs of $651 million related to the employee stock option transfer program, and a 10% increase in operating expenses including headcount related costs.
 
Server and Tools revenue grew 18% to $4.00 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2004. Server revenue, including CALs, grew $504 million or 20% driven primarily by an estimated 16% increase in Windows-based server shipments driving growth in new Windows Server license sales as well as growth in SQL Server and Exchange Server revenue. Consulting and Premier product support services increased $107 million or 23% compared to the prior year’s first six months. Revenue from developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press and other services was consistent with the prior year’s first six months. Server and Tools operating income for the first six months of fiscal 2004 decreased to $166 million compared to $526 million in the prior year primarily due to the stock based compensation costs from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 and an 11% increase in operating expenses including headcount related costs.
 
Information Worker
 
Revenue from Information Worker was $2.90 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, increasing 27% from the prior year’s second quarter. Information Worker includes revenue from Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, SharePoint Portal Server CALs, other information worker products including Microsoft LiveMeeting and OneNote, and professional product support services. Revenue for the quarter included $137 million of revenue deferred from the first quarter of fiscal 2004 for purchases of Office XP made in the first quarter that included rights to upgrade to Office 2003 when Office 2003 was released in the second quarter. Revenue from retail packaged product sales grew 36% from the second quarter of fiscal 2003 in part due to the release of the new Office 2003 during the second quarter. OEM licensing revenue from Office products and pre-installed versions of Office in Japan grew 22% from the second quarter of fiscal 2003. Contributing to the increase in revenue was a lower deferral rate for undelivered elements in the quarter ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the prior year’s comparable quarter, which resulted in a higher proportion of revenue earned. Information Worker operating income for the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 increased 1% due to the 27% growth in revenue from the prior year, which were mostly offset by an increase in operating expenses, primarily related to $351 million in stock-based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program, headcount related costs, and increased costs associated with Office 2003 launch.
 
Revenue from Information Worker was $5.18 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2003, increasing 14% from the prior year’s first six months. Revenue growth was driven by recognition of unearned revenue from a large increase in multi-year licenses signed prior to the transition to the Company’s Licensing 6.0 programs and 26% growth in retailed packaged product sales in part due to the release of the new Office 2003. OEM and pre-installed versions of Office in Japan grew 30% in the first six months of fiscal 2004. Information Worker operating income for the first six months of fiscal year 2004 declined 2% due to an increase in operating expenses, primarily related to the stock based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program and higher sales and marketing expenses, partially offset by the 14% growth in revenue from the prior year.

Microsoft Business Solutions includes Microsoft Great Plains, Microsoft Navision, Microsoft Axapta, Microsoft Solomon, Microsoft CRM, bCentral and other business applications and services. The revenue increase of $55 million was primarily attributable to continued growth in licensing of Navision products and Business Contact Manager as well as the timing of licensing agreements. Microsoft Business Solutions operating loss for the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 declined 21% led by the 41% increase in revenue, partially offset by a 17% increase in operating expenses primarily related to stock based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program.

Table of Contents

Microsoft Business Solutions revenue for the first six months of fiscal 2004 was $318 million compared to $241 million in the prior year’s first six months. The additional sales attributable to the acquisition of Navision at the beginning of the fiscal year resulted in the majority of the revenue increase from the prior year. Microsoft Business Solutions operating loss for the first six months of fiscal 2004 declined 18% led by the 32% increase in revenue, partially offset by a 10% increase in operating expenses primarily related to stock based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program.
 
MSN
 
MSN revenue totaled $546 million in the second quarter growing 19% from the second quarter of the prior year. MSN includes MSN subscriptions and the MSN network of Internet products and services. MSN Network services revenue grew $93 million or 47% as a result of growth in paid search and growth in the overall Internet advertising market. MSN subscription revenue declined $6 million or 2% as the number of subscribers continued to decline as our narrowband subscriber base continues to migrate to competitively priced broadband or other ISPs. Subscription revenue may decline for the remainder of the fiscal year as the overall MSN subscriber base is expected to continue to decline. MSN incurred an operating loss of $79 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to an operating loss of $197 million in the prior year’s second quarter. The operating loss in the second quarter included $144 million related to stock based compensation costs related to the employee stock option transfer program.
 
MSN revenue totaled $1.04 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2004 compared to $886 million in the prior year’s first six months. MSN Subscription revenue declined 4% or $23 million, reflecting a decrease in the overall subscriber base. MSN Network services grew 49% or $174 million as a result of Internet advertising revenue. MSN reported an operating loss of $21 million compared to a loss of $344 million in the first six months of the prior year. The improvement in operating results was driven primarily from lower operating expenses and a $48 million one-time refund of prior year taxes, partially offset by the costs related to the employee stock option transfer program which was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2004.
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices second quarter revenue totaled $63 million, compared to $38 million in the prior year’s second quarter. Mobile and Embedded Devices includes Windows Mobile software, Windows Embedded device operating systems, MapPoint, and Windows Automotive. The increase in revenue was driven by growth in all businesses. The revenue growth realized by MapPoint is expected to ease in future quarters, as the year-over-year growth reflects the addition of revenue from the acquisition of Vicinity Corporation toward the end of the second quarter of the prior fiscal year. Mobile and Embedded Devices operating loss was 49% higher in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to the prior year’s second quarter, primarily due to $58 million related to stock based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program, partially offset by 66% growth in revenue.
 
Fiscal 2004 revenue for the first six months totaled $116 million, compared to $66 million in the prior year’s first six months. The increase in revenue was driven by growth in all businesses. Mobile and Embedded Devices operating loss was 3% higher in the first six months of fiscal 2004 compared to the prior year’s first six months, primarily driven by stock based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program, partially offset by the 76% growth in revenue.
 
Home and Entertainment
 
Home and Entertainment revenue was $1.27 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, declining 5% from $1.33 billion in the prior year’s second quarter. Home and Entertainment includes the Xbox video game system, PC games, consumer software and hardware, and TV platform. Xbox revenue increased $15 million or 2% from the prior year’s second quarter, with $175 million related to higher volumes of Xbox software, offset by a $37 million decline due to lower Xbox console volumes and a $123 million decrease related to price reductions of

Table of Contents

Xbox consoles and software. Xbox console volumes declined 6%. This decline primarily reflects a change in the timing of the introduction of our Xbox holiday offering, which in fiscal 2004 occurred in the first quarter and in fiscal 2003 occurred in the second quarter. Xbox’s life to date U.S. games attach rate according to NPD data was 6.4 games per console with over 400 games available. Revenue from consumer hardware and software and PC games declined $78 million or 18% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2003 due to stronger sales of our PC games software titles in the prior year and a decline in revenue from PC gaming devices.
 
Home and Entertainment operating loss for the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 improved 4% from the second quarter of fiscal year 2003 driven by increasing margins from a shift in the product mix toward higher margin Xbox software for the Xbox console, lower product development costs and lower marketing costs, partially offset by stock based compensation associated with the employee stock option transfer program.
 
Home and Entertainment revenue was $1.85 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2004, increasing 2% from $1.81 billion in the prior year’s first six months. Xbox revenue increased $68 million or 6% from the prior year’s first six months, with $177 million related to higher volumes of Xbox software and $46 million increase due to higher Xbox console volumes and a $155 million decrease related to price reductions of Xbox consoles and software. Xbox console volumes increased 5%. Revenue from consumer hardware and software and PC games declined $35 million or 5% compared to the prior year’s first six months due to a decline in revenue from PC gaming devices.
 
Home and Entertainment operating loss for the first six months of fiscal year 2004 increased 2% from the first six months of fiscal year 2003 driven by 2% growth in operating expenses, including stock based compensation costs associated with the employee stock option transfer program.
 
Cost of revenue
 
Cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products and programs sold, operation costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, and costs associated with the delivery of consulting services. Cost of revenue was $2.34 billion, or 23.1% of revenue, in the second quarter, compared to $2.14 billion, or 25.0% of revenue, in the second quarter of the prior year. The increase in absolute dollars resulted primarily from $215 million in stock based compensation expense associated with the employee stock option transfer program. The increase in absolute dollars in cost of revenue was partially offset by a 12% decrease in Home & Entertainment costs, due to a decrease in Xbox console units sold and lower costs of producing the Xbox console and higher margined Xbox games sold. Cost of revenue was $3.82 billion, or 20.8% of revenue, in the first six months of fiscal 2004, compared to $3.48 billion, or 21.4% of revenue, in the first six months of the prior year. The cost of sales growth was primarily driven by stock based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program and an increase in product support and consulting services, partially offset by a decline in Xbox consoles product costs.
 
Research and development
 
Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, equity compensation and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Research and development expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 were $2.97 billion, 29.3% of revenue, compared to $1.52 billion, 17.7% of revenue, in the second quarter of the prior year. The increase was primarily due to $1.31 billion in stock based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program and $167 million or 14% increase in headcount-related costs. Research and development expenses for the first six months of fiscal 2004 were $4.58 billion, 24.9% of revenue, an increase of 42% over the first six months of the prior year. The six month increase was primarily due to the stock based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program and $105 million or 4% increase in other headcount-related costs.

Sales and marketing
 
Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, equity compensation and other headcount-related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, tradeshows, seminars, and other programs. Sales and marketing expenses were $2.47 billion in the second quarter, or 24.3% of revenue, compared to $2.16 billion in the second quarter of the prior year, or 25.3% of revenue. Sales and marketing costs increased in absolute dollars due to stock based compensation expense associated with the employee stock option transfer program. Sales and marketing expenses were $3.97 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2004, or 21.6% of revenue, compared to $3.57 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2003, or 21.9% of revenue. The absolute dollar increase was due to the stock based compensation expense related to the employee stock option transfer program and $53 million or 3% increase in other headcount related costs.
 
General and administrative
 
General and administrative costs include payroll, employee benefits, equity compensation and other headcount-related costs associated with the finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources and other administrative headcount, and legal and other administrative fees. General and administrative costs were $896 million in the second quarter compared to $497 million in the comparable quarter of the prior year. General and administrative costs increased in the second quarter primarily from $280 million in stock based compensation expense and $19 million in fees and expenses associated with the employee stock option transfer program as well as higher legal costs including settlement costs and headcount-related expenses. For the first six months of fiscal 2004, general and administrative costs were $1.37 billion compared to $749 million in the first six months of the prior year. General and administrative costs in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 included a charge of approximately $210 million related to the settlement of class action lawsuits. The second quarter of fiscal 2004 included the expenses associated with the employee stock option transfer program and certain settlement costs.
 
NON-OPERATING ITEMS, INVESTMENT INCOME, AND INCOME TAXES
 
Losses on equity investees and other incorporates Microsoft’s share of income or loss from equity method investments and income or loss attributable to minority interests. Losses on equity investees and other declined to $5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to $12 million in the comparable quarter of fiscal 2003. Losses on equity investees and other declined to $15 million in the first six months of fiscal 2004, compared to $34 million in the comparable period of fiscal 2003. These decreases were a result of reduced losses and increased income generated by the equity investees for the period ended December 31, 2003, as well as a reduction in the number of equity investees through sale of investments in fiscal year 2003.

Dividends and interest income was relatively consistent for both the comparable quarterly and six month periods even though the overall portfolio earning such income increased mainly due to the non-recurring dividends earned in the prior comparable periods related to the AT&T 5% convertible preferred debt holding. Net gains (losses) on investments includes other-than-temporary impairments of $43 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to $421 million in the second quarter of the prior year, and $61 million for the six month period ended December 31, 2003 compared to $855 million in the prior year comparable period and were down mainly due to improved market conditions. Realized gains from investments increased to $353 million compared

to $317 million in the second quarter of the prior year, and were $616 million compared to $623 million in the six month period of the prior year. Net losses on derivative instruments of $383 million for the six month period ended December 31, 2002 were driven mainly by the impact of decreasing interest rates on interest rate sensitive instruments noted during the first quarter of fiscal 2003.
 
Income Taxes
 
The effective tax rate for both the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2004 is approximately 33%. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 was 32%, reflecting a benefit in the second quarter of $126 million from the reversal of previously accrued taxes.
 
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
 
Effective July 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, using the retroactive restatement method described in SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Stock-based employee compensation expense was $1.06 billion ($709 million after-tax or $0.07 per diluted share) and $2.11 billion ($1.41 billion after-tax or $0.13 per diluted share) for the three and six months ended December 31, 2002, respectively, and $3.23 billion ($2.17 billion after-tax or $0.20 per diluted share) and $4.25 billion ($2.85 billion after-tax or $0.26 per diluted share) for the three and six months ended December 31, 2003, respectively. The amounts for the three and six months ended December 31, 2003 include $2.21 billion ($1.48 billion after-tax or $0.14 per diluted share) due to the stock option transfer program, which is described below. The June 30, 2003 balance sheet has been restated for the retroactive adoption of the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 which resulted in a $13.89 billion increase in common stock and paid-in capital, a $10.00 billion decrease in retained earnings, and a $3.89 billion increase in deferred income taxes.
 
In fiscal year 2004, we implemented changes in employee compensation designed to help us continue to attract and retain the best employees, and to better align employee interests with those of our shareholders. Employees are now granted stock awards instead of stock options. The stock award program offers employees the opportunity to earn shares of our stock over time, rather than options that give employees the right to purchase stock at a set price. We also completed an employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 whereby employees could elect to transfer all of their vested and unvested stock options with a strike price of $33 or higher (“eligible options”) to JPMorgan. The unvested eligible options that were transferred to JPMorgan became vested upon the transfer. The price paid by JPMorgan for the transferred options was determined by reference to the arithmetic average of the closing prices of Microsoft common stock during the period from November 14, 2003 to December 8, 2003, which was $25.5720.
 
A total of 18,503 (51%) of the 36,539 eligible Microsoft employees elected to participate in the stock option transfer program and 344.6 million (55%) of the 621.4 million eligible options were tendered. Under the terms of the program, JPMorgan paid Microsoft $382 million for the transferred options. Microsoft made an initial payment of $219 million to participating employees for the transferred options, with a remaining portion to be paid in one or more payments that are subject to participating employees’ continued employment over the next two or three years. The options that were transferred to JPMorgan resulted in stock-based compensation expense of $2.21 billion ($1.48 billion after-tax or $0.14 per diluted share). This expense consists of the unrecognized compensation costs of the options that were transferred, less the amounts payable applicable to those previously unvested options for which payment is contingent upon continued employment of participating employees. The contingent payments applicable to unvested eligible options that are subject to continued employment of participating employees will be recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the contingent payments.
 
The stock option transfer program also resulted in a decrease to our long term deferred tax assets due to the excess of recorded compensation expense for these options over the related tax deduction reported on our tax

return. For the six months ended December 31, 2003, deferred tax assets were reduced by approximately $2.01 billion with an offsetting reduction in paid-in capital, reflecting the reduction of previously recorded deductions reported on our tax return in excess of stock based compensation expense.
 
FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
Cash and short-term investments totaled $52.78 billion as of December 31, 2003 compared to $49.05 billion as of June 30, 2003. The portfolio consists primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade securities. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S. dollar denominated securities, but also includes foreign currency positions, in order to diversify financial risk.
 
Unearned revenue as of December 31, 2003 decreased $395 million from September 30, 2003 reflecting a sequential decrease in unearned revenue associated with Upgrade Advantage contracts billed in prior periods and lower average deferral rates on Windows and Office partially offset by sequential growth in new and recurring multi-year licensing agreements.
 
Cash and short-term investments totaled $52.78 billion as of December 31, 2003. Cash flow from operations was $8.0 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2004, a decrease of $941 million from the first six months of the prior year. The decrease reflects an approximately $2.22 billion decline in cash flow from unearned revenue resulting from a decline in multi-year contract billings, build up in accounts receivable, and gains on our portfolio investments. Cash used for financing was $2.62 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2004, a decrease of $909 million from the first six months of the prior year, reflecting a decrease of approximately $2.66 billion in stock repurchases, partially offset by a cash dividend of $1.73 billion. During the first six months of fiscal 2004, we repurchased 73.8 million shares of common stock, compared to 159.4 million shares of common stock in the comparable period of the prior year. Cash used for investing was $5.70 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2004, an increase of approximately $2.78 billion from the first six months of the prior year.
 
We have no material long-term debt. Stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2003 was $69.34 billion. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities and computer systems for R&D, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. Commitments for constructing new buildings were $153 million on December 31, 2003. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources.
 
We believe existing cash and short-term investments together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short-term investments, as well as equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We continuously assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.
 
Off-balance sheet arrangements
 
We have unconditionally guaranteed the repayment of certain Japanese Yen denominated bank loans and related interest and fees of Jupiter Telecommunication, Ltd., a Japanese cable company (Jupiter). These guarantees arose on February 1, 2003 in conjunction with the expiration of prior financing arrangements, including previous guarantees by us. The financing arrangements were entered into by Jupiter as part of financing its operations. As part of Jupiter’s new financing agreement, we agreed to guarantee repayment by Jupiter of the loans of approximately $55 million. The estimated fair value and the carrying value of the guarantees was $10.5 million and did not result in a charge to operations. The guarantees are in effect until the earlier of repayment of
 
26
Table of Contents

the loans, including accrued interest and fees, or February 1, 2009. The maximum amount of the guarantees is limited to the sum of the total due and unpaid principal amounts, accrued and unpaid interest, and any other related expenses. Additionally, the maximum amount of the guarantees, denominated in Japanese yen, will vary based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. If we were required to make payments under the guarantees, we may recover all or a portion of those payments upon liquidation of Jupiter’s assets. The proceeds from such liquidation cannot be accurately estimated due to the multitude of factors that would affect the valuation and realization of the proceeds in the event of liquidation.
 
In connection with various operating leases, we issued residual value guarantees, which provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value. As of December 31, 2003, the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately $271 million. We believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability to us currently exists.
 
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by FASB Interpretation 45, Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45). We consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements.
 
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
 
In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation 46R (FIN 46R), a revision to Interpretation 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46R clarifies some of the provisions of FIN 46 and exempts certain entities from its requirements. FIN 46R is effective at the end of the first interim period ending after March 15, 2004. Entities that have adopted FIN 46 prior to this effective date can continue to apply the provisions of FIN 46 until the effective date of FIN 46R. Microsoft adopted FIN 46 on July 1, 2003 and it did not have a material impact on our financial statements. The early adoption of FIN46R did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
 
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, accounting for stock-based compensation, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, and accounting for income taxes.
 
We account for the licensing of software in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. The application of SOP 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for those elements. End users receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. These elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, the fair value of which is recognized over the product’s estimated life cycle. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of

earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.
 
We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123. The application of SFAS 123 requires judgment, including the expected life and stock price volatility for stock options and expected dividends and forfeitures for all stock-based awards. Changes in the expected or actual outcome of forfeitures due to service- and/or performance-related conditions could materially impact the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized.
 
SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 59, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other factors, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost; the financial health of and near-term business outlook for the investee, including factors such as industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow; and our intent and ability to hold the investment.
 
SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (July 1st for Microsoft) and between annual tests in certain circumstances. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. Significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.
 
We account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including SFAS 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, and SFAS 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in creating a computer software product should be charged to expense when incurred as research and development until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material, and accordingly, we expense all research and development costs when incurred.
 
We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. We evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations.
 
SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) contains statements that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in “Issues and Uncertainties” and elsewhere in this report.
 
REVENUE
 
Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 was $8.22 billion, an increase of 6% over the first quarter of fiscal year 2003. The revenue growth was driven primarily by licensing for Server and Tools products along with 20% growth in Home and Entertainment revenue and 15% growth in MSN revenue.
 
CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME
 
Operating income of $3.15 billion grew 4% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2004. The growth in operating income reflected an increase of $469 million in revenue, partially offset by an increase of $349 million in operating expenses, primarily related to Home and Entertainment product costs, employee-related costs associated with additional headcount, and increased legal costs including certain settlement expenses.
 
We adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, on July 1, 2003 and restated prior periods to reflect compensation cost under the recognition provisions of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees after July 1, 1995. Headcount-related costs in operating expenses include equity compensation. At September 30, 2003, 1.48 billion vested and unvested options were outstanding, compared to 10.81 billion common shares outstanding. In the first quarter of fiscal 2004, we granted stock awards for 57 million shares of stock, 29 million shares of which are performance-based awards for the 2004-2006 performance period under our Shared Performance Stock Award (SPSA) program. The shares of stock under these awards are subject to vesting and, in the case of the performance-based stock awards, achievement of target performance over the three year period. In general, we do not plan to make additional SPSA grants to the recipients of the SPSA grants referred to above during the three year performance period. Total equity compensation costs included in operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 was $1.02 billion, compared to $1.05 billion in the prior year’s comparable quarter. The June 30, 2003 balance sheet has been restated for the retroactive adoption of the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 which resulted in a $13.89 billion increase in common stock and paid-in capital, a $10.00 billion decrease in retained earnings, and a $3.89 billion increase in deferred income taxes.

Client
 
Client revenue was $2.81 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and 2004. Client includes revenue from Windows XP Professional and Home, Windows 2000 Professional, and other standard Windows operating systems. Client revenue in the first quarter was flat compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2003 at $2.81 billion driven by a flat reported license growth and no year over year change in product mix. In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company completed its transition to new licensing terms under which OEMs are billed for products when Certificates of Authenticity (COAs) are acquired, rather than upon PC shipment, resulting in an increase in reported licenses related to inventory accumulation. PC shipments growth in the first quarter of fiscal year 2004, driven primarily by strength in the consumer and small business market segments, enabled Client to offset the inventory accumulation impact in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Client operating income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 was flat compared to the first quarter of the prior year primarily as a result of flat revenue and a 1% growth in operating expenses.
 
Server and Tools
 
Server and Tools revenue was $1.63 billion and $1.87 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2003 and 2004. Server and Tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (CALs) for Windows Server, SQL Server, Exchange Server, and other servers. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier product support services, and Microsoft consulting services. Server and Tools revenue grew 15% in the first quarter, driven in part by an increase in Windows-based server shipments and in part by growth in SQL Server and Exchange revenue. Server revenue, including CALs, grew $214 million or 18% from the prior year’s first quarter as a result of revenue earned from previously billed multi-year licensing agreements and new server shipment sales. Consulting and Premier product support services increased $37 million or 16% compared to the prior year’s first quarter. Revenue from developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press and other services declined $10 million or 5%. Server and Tools operating income grew 25% in the first quarter of 2004, primarily as a result of the 15% growth in revenue partially offset by a 13% increase in operating expenses. Operating expense growth was primarily due to growth in headcount-related costs.
 
Information Worker
 
Information Worker revenue was $2.27 billion and $2.29 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2003 and 2004. Information Worker includes revenue from Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, SharePoint Portal Server CALs, other information worker products including Microsoft LiveMeeting, and professional product support services. Revenue from Information Worker increased 1% from the prior year’s first quarter. Revenue from OEM licensing of Office products grew 30% from the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Revenue for the quarter excluded $137 million of revenue deferred for technology guarantees provided to customers who purchased Office in first quarter of fiscal 2004. Information Worker operating income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 declined 4% due to an increase in operating expenses for headcount-related costs which more than offset the 1% revenue growth from prior year.
 
Microsoft Business Solutions
 
Microsoft Business Solutions revenue was $106 million and $128 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2003 and 2004. Microsoft Business Solutions includes Microsoft Great Plains, Microsoft Navision, Microsoft Axapta, Microsoft Solomon, Microsoft CRM, bCentral and other business applications and services. Microsoft Business Solutions revenue for the first quarter increased 21% compared to the prior year’s first quarter. The revenue increase of $22 million was primarily attributable to continued growth in licensing of Navision products. Microsoft Business Solutions operating loss for the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 declined 16% led by the 21% increase in revenue, partially offset by the 4% increase in operating expenses.
 
MSN
 
MSN revenue was $427 million and $491 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2003 and 2004. MSN includes MSN subscriptions and the MSN network of Internet products and services. MSN subscriptions revenue declined $17 million or 6% reflecting a decrease in the number of subscribers, offset by growth in MSN network services revenue, which grew $81 million or 51% as a result of growth in paid search and strong general advertising sales across all geographic regions. MSN reported operating income of $58 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to an operating loss of $147 million in the prior year’s first quarter. The profitability was driven by the revenue growth and the 25% decline in operating expenses, which included a $48 million one-time refund of prior year taxes.
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices revenue was $28 million and $53 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2003 and 2004. Mobile and Embedded Devices includes Windows Mobile software, Windows Embedded device operating systems, MapPoint, and Windows Automotive. The increase in revenue was driven by growth in all businesses. The revenue growth also reflected revenue from the Vicinity acquisition, which was not included in the prior year’s first quarter. Mobile and Embedded Devices operating loss was 51% lower in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to the prior year’s first quarter, primarily driven by the 89% growth in revenue and timing of operating expenses.
 
Home and Entertainment
 
Home and Entertainment revenue was $485 million and $581 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2003 and 2004. Home and Entertainment includes the Xbox video game system, PC games, consumer software and hardware, and TV platform. Home and Entertainment revenue increased 20% from the prior year’s first quarter. Xbox revenue increased $53 million or 20% from the prior year’s first quarter, with $85 million related to higher volumes of Xbox consoles, peripherals, and games offset by a $32 million decrease related to price changes. Revenue from consumer hardware and software and PC games increased $43 million or 19% compared to a year ago. Home and Entertainment operating loss for the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 increased 11% from the first quarter of fiscal year 2003 driven by 17% growth in operating expenses related to increased product costs associated with higher consoles sold and higher sales and marketing expenses, partially offset by 20% growth in revenue.

Foreign Currencies Impact
 
Translated international revenue is affected by foreign exchange rates. The net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in the first quarter compared to a year ago, primarily due to a stronger Euro and Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. Had the rates from the prior year’s comparable quarter been in effect in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been approximately $165 million lower. Certain manufacturing, selling, distribution, and support costs are disbursed in local currencies, and a portion of international revenue is hedged, thus offsetting a portion of the translation exposure.
 
Cost of revenue
 
Cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products and programs sold, operation costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, and costs associated with the delivery of consulting services. Cost of revenue as a percent of revenue was 17.4% and 18.0% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2003 and 2004. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2004, cost of revenue was $1.48 billion compared to $1.34 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2003. The increase in absolute dollars, as well as percentage of revenue, resulted primarily from a 27% increase in Home & Entertainment costs, due to increased Xbox console units sold partially offset by lower costs of producing the Xbox console and an 11% increase in product support and consulting services.
 
Research and development
 
Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, equity compensation and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Research and development expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 were $1.61 billion, 19.6% of revenue, a decrease of 6% in absolute dollar terms over the first quarter of the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a $62 million or 4% decrease in headcount-related costs and a $16 million or 14% decrease in third party product development costs.
 
Sales and marketing
 
Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, equity compensation and other headcount-related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, tradeshows, seminars, and other programs. Sales and marketing expenses were $1.51 billion in the first quarter, or 18.3% of revenue, compared to $1.42 billion in the first quarter of the prior year, or 18.3% of revenue. Sales and marketing costs increased in absolute dollars due to a 22% increase in headcount-related expenses, primarily from additions to the Enterprise and Small/Medium sales forces, partially offset by lower other sales expenses.
 
General and administrative
 
General and administrative costs include payroll, employee benefits, equity compensation and other headcount-related costs associated with the finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources, other administrative headcount, and legal and other administrative fees. General and administrative costs were $471 million in the first quarter compared to $252 million in the comparable quarter of the prior year. General and administrative costs increased in the first quarter primarily from higher legal costs including certain settlement costs and headcount-related expenses.
 
NON-OPERATING ITEMS, INVESTMENT INCOME, AND INCOME TAXES
 
Non-operating items
 
Losses on equity investees and other consists of Microsoft’s share of income or loss from equity method investments and income or loss attributable to minority interests. Losses on equity investees and other decreased to $10 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, from $22 million in the comparable quarter of fiscal 2003.
 
Investment Income
 
We recorded investment income in each year as follows:
 
(In millions)	  	 	 	 	 
Three Months Ended Sept. 30
  	2002
 	 	2003
Dividends and interest

  	$	516	 	 	$	484

  	 	(347	)	 	 	34
 	  	
 	
Investment income

  	$	41	 	 	$	763
 	  	
 	
 
Dividends and interest declined moderately, mainly due to the $62 million AT&T dividend earned in the prior comparable quarter and offset somewhat by higher interest income earned on investments. Net gains (losses) on sales of investments includes other-than-temporary impairments of $18 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to $434 million in the first quarter of the prior year, which accounted for the majority of the increase to investment income. Net gains attributable to derivative instruments were $34 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to losses of $347 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 which were driven mainly by the impact of decreasing interest rates on interest rate sensitive instruments.

Income Taxes
 
The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 33%. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 was 32%, reflecting a benefit in the second quarter of $126 million from the reversal of previously accrued taxes. Excluding this reversal, the effective tax rate would have been 33%.
 
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
 
In fiscal year 2004, we implemented changes in employee compensation designed to help us continue to attract and retain the best employees, and to better align employee interests with those of our shareholders. Employees are granted Stock Awards instead of stock options. The Stock Award program offers employees the opportunity to earn actual shares of our stock over time, rather than options that give employees the right to purchase stock at a set price. As part of the changes, we announced that a significant portion of stock-based compensation for more than 600 of our senior leaders will depend on growth in the number and satisfaction of our customers.
 
In addition to implemented changes to our employee compensation arrangements, we also adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 effective July 1, 2003 using the retroactive restatement method described in SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, stock-based compensation costs is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Stock-based employee compensation expense was $1.05 billion ($702 million after-tax or $0.06 per diluted share) for the three months ended September 30, 2002 and $1.02 billion ($680 million after-tax or $0.06 per diluted share) for the three months ended September 30, 2003.
 
In October 2003, we commenced a stock option transfer program pursuant to which our employees may transfer certain employee stock options to a third-party financial institution. It is anticipated that the stock option transfer program will be completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 and will result in a charge to earnings related to unrecognized compensation costs of unvested options transferred. We are not currently able to estimate the potential charge to earnings as it is dependent upon how many and which options are transferred.
 
FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
Cash and short-term investments totaled $51.62 billion as of September 30, 2003 compared to $49.05 billion as of June 30, 2003. The portfolio consists primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S. dollar denominated securities, but also includes foreign currency positions, in order to diversify financial risk.
 
Unearned revenue as of September 30, 2003 decreased $768 million from June 30, 2003 reflecting a sequential decrease in new and recurring multi-year licensing agreements, and recognition of unearned revenue from multi-year licensing in prior periods.
 
Cash flow from operations was $3.42 billion in the September quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to $6.17 billion in the comparable quarter of the prior year. The decrease reflects a $2.12 billion decline in cash flow from unearned revenue resulting from a decline in multi-year contract billings. Cash used for financing was $350 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, a decrease of $2.61 billion from the comparable quarter of the prior year reflecting a decrease in cash used for stock repurchases. We repurchased 43.3 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in the first quarter, compared to 120.6 million shares repurchased in the comparable quarter of the prior year. Cash used for investing was $3.75 billion in the September quarter, an increase of $2.85 billion from the prior year due to greater sales of investments in the first quarter of fiscal 2003.
 
We have no material long-term debt. Stockholders’ equity at September 30, 2003 was $66.68 billion. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities and computer systems for R&D, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. Commitments for constructing new buildings were $149 million on September 30, 2003. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources.
 
We believe existing cash and short-term investments together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short-term investments, as well as equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We continuously assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.
 
Off-balance sheet arrangements
 
We have unconditionally guaranteed the repayment of certain Japanese yen denominated bank loans and related interest and fees of Jupiter Telecommunication, Ltd., a Japanese cable company (Jupiter). These guarantees arose on February 1, 2003 in conjunction with the expiration of prior financing arrangements, including previous guarantees by us. The financing arrangements were entered into by Jupiter as part of financing its operations. As part of Jupiter’s new financing agreement, we agreed to guarantee repayment by Jupiter of the loans of approximately $56 million. The estimated fair value and the carrying value of the guarantees was $10.5 million and did not result in a charge to operations. The guarantees are in effect until the earlier of repayment of the loans, including accrued interest and fees, or February 1, 2009. The maximum amount of the guarantees is limited to the sum of the total due and unpaid principal amounts, accrued and unpaid interest, and any other related expenses. Additionally, the maximum amount of the guarantees, denominated in Japanese yen, will vary based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. If we were required to make payments under the guarantees, we may recover all or a portion of those payments upon liquidation of Jupiter’s assets. The proceeds from such liquidation cannot be accurately estimated due to the multitude of factors that would affect the valuation and realization of the proceeds in the event of liquidation.
 
In connection with various operating leases, we issued residual value guarantees, which provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value. As of September 30, 2003, the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately $271 million. We believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability to us currently exists.
 
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by FASB Interpretation 45, Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45). We consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, accounting for stock-based compensation, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, and accounting for income taxes.
 
We account for the licensing of software in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. The application of SOP 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for those elements. End users receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. These elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, the fair value of which is recognized over the product’s estimated life cycle. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.
 
We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123. The application of SFAS 123 requires judgment, including the expected life and stock price volatility for stock options and expected dividends and forfeitures for all stock-based awards. Changes in the expected or actual outcome of forfeitures due to service- and/or performance-related conditions could materially impact the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized.
 
SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 59, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other factors, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost; the financial health of and near-term business outlook for the investee, including factors such as industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow; and our intent and ability to hold the investment.
 
SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (July 1st for Microsoft) and between annual tests in certain circumstances. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. Significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.
 
We account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including SFAS 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, and SFAS 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in creating a computer software product should be charged to expense when incurred as research and development until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material, and accordingly, we expense all research and development costs when incurred.
 
We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. We evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations.
 
SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations.

Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2003 was $7.84 billion, an increase of 8% over the third quarter of fiscal year 2002. The revenue growth was driven primarily by recognition of unearned revenue from multi-year licensing in prior periods partially offset by a 42% decrease in Home and Entertainment revenue, which was primarily due to the launch of the Xbox console in Europe and Japan in the third quarter of fiscal 2002.
 
Revenue for the first nine months of fiscal year 2003 was $24.12 billion, a 14% increase over the first nine months of fiscal year 2002. The revenue growth was driven primarily by multi-year licensing prior to the Company’s transition to its new licensing program (Licensing 6.0) in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Prior to the July 31, 2002 transition date to Licensing 6.0, the Company experienced significant growth in multi-year licensing arrangements as customers enrolled in the Company’s maintenance programs, including Upgrade Advantage and Software Assurance. In addition to the growth in revenue from multi-year licensing, but to a lesser extent, the revenue growth reflected a 17% increase associated with OEM licensing of Microsoft Windows operating systems and a 25% increase in revenue from Microsoft Xbox video game consoles.
 
Operating Income
 
Operating income for the third quarter of fiscal year 2003 was $3.72 billion, an increase of $417 million or 13% over the third quarter of fiscal year 2002. The growth in operating income reflects an increase of $590 million in revenue, partially offset by the $173 million growth in operating expenses.
 
Operating income for the first nine months of fiscal year 2003 was $11.02 billion, an increase of $1.99 billion over the first nine months of fiscal year 2002. The growth in operating income reflects an increase of $3.01 billion in revenue, partially offset by an increase of $1.02 billion in operating expenses.
 
Product Revenue/Operating Income (Loss)
 
Microsoft revised its segments for fiscal year 2003. Microsoft’s seven segments are: Client, Server Platforms, Information Worker, Business Solutions, MSN, CE/Mobility, and Home and Entertainment. The revenue amounts in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) differ from those reported in the Company’s Segment Information appearing in Note 11 of the Notes to Financial Statements because reconciling items described in Note 11 have been allocated to the segments for purposes of MD&A. The revenue and operating income/(loss) figures in Note 11 represent amounts reported internally for management reporting, while the revenue and operating income/(loss) figures in MD&A reflect revenue recognized in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
 
Client includes revenue from Windows XP Professional and Home, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows NT Workstation, Windows Me, Windows 98, Tablet PC, and operating system software for use in devices other than PCs (embedded systems). Client revenue was $2.54 billion in the third quarter, increasing $240 million or 10% compared to $2.30 billion in the third quarter of the prior year. The quarterly revenue growth was driven by a $185 million or 10% increase in OEM licensing of Windows operating systems and $55 million of growth in organizational and retail licensing revenue, primarily from revenue recognition of unearned revenue from prior periods’ multi-year licensing. This revenue growth also reflects a 9 percentage point increase to 56% of the mix of the higher priced Windows Professional operating systems, the majority of which was in the OEM channel. Offsetting the shift to higher priced Windows operating systems was the effect of a decrease in inventory levels at certain multinational OEMs within the third quarter of fiscal 2003 leading to a 4% decline in licenses purchased compared to the prior year’s third quarter. Client operating profit increased 8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 primarily as a result of the 10% growth in revenue, partially offset by a 20% increase in operating expenses attributed to headcount-related costs and increased marketing expenses.
 
Client revenue was $7.89 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2003, representing $945 million or 14% growth from the first nine months of the prior year. The nine month revenue growth reflected a $880 million or 17% increase in OEM licensing revenue, led by a continued mix shift to the higher priced Windows XP Professional operating system and a $66 million increase in organizational licensing and retail sales, primarily from revenue recognition of unearned revenue from prior periods’ multi-year licensing. Client operating profit for the first nine months of fiscal year 2003 increased 16% primarily as a result of the 14% growth in revenue and a decrease in marketing expense reflecting the launch of Windows XP in the prior year, partially offset by a 4% increase in other operating expenses, largely attributed to headcount additions and related costs.

The Company does not expect the revenue growth attributed to the mix toward the higher priced Windows Professional operating system to continue into fiscal 2004 as the majority of the revenue growth has been realized in the current and prior fiscal years. The Company completed its transition to new OEM licensing terms at the beginning of fiscal year 2003, under which OEMs are billed upon their acquisition of Certificates of Authenticity (COAs) rather than upon the shipment of PCs to their customers. This transition has resulted in some cases in revenue related to COA inventory accumulation at OEMs and in other cases, a decrease in reported licenses as OEMs lower their inventory levels. The Company’s OEM licensing terms will continue to drive a variance between reported licenses and underlying PC shipments and thus will have a related effect on reported Client OEM revenue.
 
Server Platforms consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (CALs) for Windows Server, SQL Server, Exchange Server, Systems Management Server, Windows Terminal Server, and Small Business Server. It also includes BackOffice/Core CALs, developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier product support services, and Microsoft consulting services. Server Platforms revenue grew 21% to $1.83 billion in the third quarter, driven by an increase in Windows-based server shipments. Server revenue including CALs grew $181 million or 17% from the prior year’s third quarter, including a 39% revenue growth in SQL Server and a 59% growth in Exchange revenue. Revenue from developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press and other services increased $93 million or 40% due to recognition of previously unearned revenue. Consulting and Premier product support services increased $42 million or 18% compared to the prior year’s third quarter. Server operating profit for the third quarter grew 24%, primarily as a result of the 21% increase in revenue.
 
Server Platforms revenue grew $700 million or 16% to $5.22 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2003, driven overall by a $536 million or 17% increase in Server and Server applications revenue, led by an increase in Windows-based server shipments, a $107 million or 17% increase in revenue from developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press and other services, and $58 million or 8% increase in consulting and Premier product support services. Server operating profit for the first nine months grew 22%, primarily as a result of the 16% increase in revenue.
 
Information Worker includes revenue from Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Visio, other information worker products, SharePoint Portal Server CALs, and professional product support services. Revenue from Information Worker was $2.33 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, increasing 9% from the prior year’s third quarter. Office and other standalone applications revenue growth was $194 million or 9% due to recognition of unearned revenue from strong multi-year licensing in prior periods. Information Worker operating profit for the third quarter grew 7% led by the 9% increase in revenue, partially offset by a 20% growth in operating expenses related to headcount additions and marketing expenses.
 
Revenue from Information Worker was $6.88 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2003, increasing $835 million or 14% from the prior year’s first nine months. This increase was primarily due to the recognition of unearned revenue from a large increase in multi-year licenses signed prior to the transition to the Company’s Licensing 6.0 programs. Information Worker operating profit for the first nine months grew 13% led by the 14% increase in revenue, partially offset by a 15% growth in operating expenses related to headcount additions and marketing expenses.
 
Business Solutions includes Microsoft Great Plains, Navision, and bCentral. Business Solutions revenue for the third quarter was $147 million compared to $75 million in the prior year’s third quarter. Business Solutions revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2003 was $388 million compared to $222 million in the prior year’s first nine months. A total of $72 million in the third quarter and $160 million in the first nine months is attributable to additional sales revenue from the acquisition of Navision at the beginning of the fiscal year. Business Solutions operating loss for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2003 increased 40% and 54%, respectively, primarily due to acquisition costs and operating losses associated with Navision and increases in sales and marketing expenses.
 
MSN includes MSN Subscription and MSN Network services. MSN revenue totaled $508 million in the third quarter compared to $404 million in the prior year’s third quarter. MSN revenue totaled $1.39 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2003 compared to $1.12 million in the prior year’s first nine months. MSN Subscription revenue grew $22 million or 9% in the third quarter and $80 million or 11% in the first nine months of fiscal year 2003 reflecting an increase in revenue generating subscribers due to a reduction in promotional subscribers as promotional programs began to lapse. MSN Subscribers at the end of third quarter of fiscal year 2003 totaled 8.7 million, compared to 8.4 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2002. MSN Network services revenue

grew $82 million or 55% in the third quarter and $190 million or 48% in the first nine months of fiscal 2003 as a result of growth in paid search and strong general advertising revenue across all geographic regions. MSN operating loss for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2003 decreased 45% and 43%, respectively, primarily as a result of the growth in revenue and lower relative subscription support costs.
 
CE/Mobility includes Pocket PC, Handheld PC, SmartPhone, other Mobility, CE operating systems, and MapPoint. Third quarter revenue totaled $38 million, compared to $21 million in the prior year’s third quarter. Operating loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2003 increased 60% from the prior year as higher marketing expenses and headcount-related costs associated with product development more than offset the growth in revenue. Revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2003 totaled $90 million, compared to $64 million in the prior year’s first nine months. The increase in revenue was driven by increased Pocket PC shipments, launch of SmartPhone, and market acceptance of Windows CE, partially offset by declines in revenue from Handheld PCs. Operating loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2003 increased 35% from the prior year as higher marketing expenses and headcount-related costs associated with product development more than offset the growth in revenue. Prior period CE/Mobility revenue and operating loss has been restated to reflect the third quarter 2003 reorganization of MapPoint from Information Worker to CE/Mobility.
 
Home and Entertainment includes the Xbox video game system, PC games, consumer software and hardware, and TV platform. Home and Entertainment revenue was $453 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, decreasing 42% from $778 million in the prior year’s third quarter. Of the revenue decrease in Home and Entertainment, $262 million was related to lower sales of Xbox video game systems and related games in all geographic regions, compared to the prior year’s third quarter. The revenue decline in Xbox for the third quarter of fiscal 2003 compared to the prior year resulted from a $174 million decrease due to lower volume of Xbox consoles, games, and peripherals and a $88 million decrease due to price changes. The prior year’s third quarter reflected the launch of Xbox in Europe and Japan, and sales in the United States from the launch in the preceding quarter. Revenue from consumer hardware and software and PC games declined $62 million or 22% in the third quarter compared to a year ago. Operating loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2003 increased 96% from the prior year as the result of the 42% decline in revenue and increased operating expenses, primarily marketing expenses.
 
Home and Entertainment revenue was $2.27 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2003, increasing from $2.01 billion in the prior year’s first nine months. Of the overall revenue increase in Home and Entertainment, $277 million of the increase was attributed to sales of Xbox video game systems and related games which were available for all of fiscal 2003. The revenue growth in Xbox for the first nine months of fiscal 2003 compared to the prior year resulted from a $777 million increase in volume for Xbox consoles, games, and peripherals partially offset by a $500 million decrease due to price changes. Revenue from consumer hardware and software and PC games declined $17 million or 2% in the first nine months compared to a year ago. Operating loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2003 increased 110% from the prior year as the product costs associated with the Xbox console sales growth and marketing expense growth more than offset the 13% increase in revenue.
 
Distribution Channels Revenue
 
Microsoft distributes its products primarily through OEM licenses, organizational licenses, online services and products, and retail packaged products. These distribution channels are aligned geographically with the exception of OEM customers, which are generally managed centrally.
 
The Company’s three major geographic sales and marketing organizations are the Americas Region; the Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region (EMEA); and the Japan and Asia-Pacific Region. For fiscal year 2003, Microsoft reorganized the alignment of countries located in the South Pacific to be included as part of the Japan and Asia-Pacific region. Prior year geographic revenue has been adjusted to conform to the current presentation. Sales of organization licenses and retail packaged products via these channels are primarily to and through distributors and resellers.
 
OEM channel revenue represents license fees from original equipment manufacturers who pre-install Microsoft products, primarily on PCs. OEM revenue for the third quarter was $2.50 billion, up 9% from $2.29 billion in the comparable quarter of fiscal 2002. The OEM revenue growth reflects a 44% increase in Windows Professional revenue due to an increase in the mix of the higher priced Windows Professional licenses, and 36% Server revenue growth, partially offset by a 4% decline in reported licenses, compared to an estimated small increase in PC shipments compared to the prior year,. The growth rate was negatively affected by a decrease in inventory levels at certain multinationals during the third quarter of 2003, leading to lower licenses purchased. OEM revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2003 was $7.69 billion, up 16% from $6.66 billion in the comparable first nine months

of fiscal 2002. The OEM revenue growth reflects a 57% increase in Windows Professional revenue due to an increase in the mix of the higher priced Windows Professional licenses. The Company does not expect the revenue growth attributed to the mix toward the higher priced Windows Professional operating system to continue into fiscal 2004 as the majority of the revenue growth has been realized in the current and prior fiscal years. The Company expects the transition to its new OEM licensing terms, as previously described under Client, to continue to have an effect on OEM revenue growth relative to underlying PC shipments.
 
Americas Region revenue in the third quarter was $2.91 billion, an increase of 9% compared to $2.66 billion in the prior year’s third quarter. The Americas region revenue growth was primarily the result of recognition of unearned revenue from multi-year licensing in prior periods for Client, Information Worker and Server products. This revenue growth was partially offset by a $137 million or 37% decrease in Home and Entertainment revenue compared to the prior year’s third quarter, primarily reflecting the launch of the Xbox gaming console in the prior year. Americas Region revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2003 was $8.90 billion, an increase of 9% compared to $8.16 billion in the prior year’s first nine months. The nine months revenue growth reflected $295 million or 13% increase in Information Worker revenue, $276 million or 13% increase in Server Platforms revenue, and $77 million or 6% increase in Home and Entertainment revenue, partially offset by a $192 million decrease as a result of the sale of Expedia, Inc. in fiscal 2002.
 
Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region revenue was $1.56 billion, increasing 12% from the $1.39 billion reported in the third quarter of the prior year. Revenue growth reflected recognition of unearned revenue from multi-year licensing in prior periods for Client, Information Worker and Server products. The acquisition of Navision in the first quarter of 2003 also led to a $60 million increase in third quarter revenue in the region compared to the prior year’s third quarter. The revenue growth was further aided by favorable foreign exchange rates compared to the prior year’s third quarter exchange rates. Had foreign exchange rates been constant with those of the third quarter of 2002, revenue in the region would have increased 1% instead of increasing 12%, excluding any effects of hedging gains and losses. Partially offsetting the revenue growth, Home and Entertainment sales declined $100 million from the third quarter of fiscal 2002, primarily reflecting the launch of the Xbox console in Europe in the third quarter of fiscal 2002. Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region revenue was $4.92 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2003, increasing 26% from the $3.91 billion reported in the first nine months of the prior year. The acquisition of Navision in the first quarter of 2003 also led to a $131 million increase in the first nine months revenue in the region compared to the prior year’s first nine months. Had foreign exchange rates been constant with those of the first nine months of 2002, revenue in the region would have increased 16% instead of increasing 26%, excluding any effects of hedging gains and losses.
 
Japan and Asia-Pacific Region revenue decreased 4% to $871 million from $912 million in the third quarter of the prior year. The region’s revenue decrease reflected a $59 million or 50% decline in Home and Entertainment sales, primarily from the launch of the Xbox console in Japan in the third quarter of fiscal 2002, a $15 million decrease in Client revenue, partially offset by $32 million in growth in Server Platforms and other products revenue. Had foreign exchange rates been constant with those of the third quarter of 2002, revenue in the region would have decreased 10% instead of decreasing 4%, excluding any effects of hedging gains and losses. Japan and Asia-Pacific Region revenue increased 9% to $2.60 billion from $2.39 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2002. Had foreign exchange rates been constant with those of the first nine months of 2002, revenue in the region would have increased 6% instead of increasing 9%, excluding any effects of hedging gains and losses.
 
Translated international revenue is affected by foreign exchange rates. The net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in the third quarter compared to a year ago, primarily due to a stronger Euro and Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. Had the rates from the prior year’s comparable quarter been in effect in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been approximately $210 million lower. Had the rates from the prior year’s first nine months been in effect in the first nine months of fiscal 2003, translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been approximately $455 million lower. Certain manufacturing, selling, distribution, and support costs are disbursed in local currencies, and a portion of international revenue is hedged, thus offsetting a portion of the translation exposure.
 
Operating Expenses
 
Cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products and programs sold, operation costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, and costs associated with the delivery of consulting services. Cost of revenue was $1.22 billion, or 15.5% of revenue, in the third quarter, compared to $1.40 billion, or 19.3% of revenue, in the

third quarter of the prior year. The decrease as percentage of revenue was substantially all from the decrease in Home & Entertainment costs associated with a decline in the volume of Xbox video game consoles, partially offset by improvement in Home and Entertainment product cost margins. For the first nine months of fiscal 2003, cost of revenue was $4.45 billion, or 18.4% of revenue, compared to $3.82 billion, or 18.1% of revenue, in the first nine months of fiscal 2002. The primary driver of the increase as a percentage of revenue was a 1.2 percentage point increase in the volume of Home and Entertainment products, partially offset by improved margins of Home and Entertainment products and a 0.9 percentage point decrease in all other products costs in the first nine months of fiscal year 2003 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2002.
 
Research and development expenses include the payroll, employee benefits, and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for global markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Research and development expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 were $1.11 billion, an increase of $45 million or 4% over the third quarter of the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a 4% increase in headcount-related costs and, to a lesser extent, a 12% increase in third-party product development costs and a 22% increase in amortization of purchased software code. Research and development expenses for the first nine months of fiscal 2003 were $3.32 billion, an increase of 6% compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2002. The increase reflects a 5% increase in headcount-related costs and, to a lesser extent, a 28% increase in third-party product development costs and a 36% increase in amortization of purchased software code.
 
Sales and marketing expenses include the payroll, employee benefits, and other headcount-related costs associated with sales and marketing headcount and marketing expenses including advertising, promotions, tradeshows, seminars, and other programs. Sales and marketing expenses were $1.49 billion in the third quarter, or 19.1% of revenue, compared to $1.24 billion in the third quarter of the prior year, or 17.1% of revenue. Sales and marketing costs increased in absolute dollars due to a 16% increase in marketing expense for several initiatives and a 26% increase in sales expenses associated with sales headcount additions and related costs, primarily additions to the Enterprise and Small/Medium Business sales forces. Sales and marketing expenses were $4.42 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2003, or 18.3% of revenue, compared to $3.86 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2002, or 18.3% of revenue. Sales and marketing costs for the first nine months of fiscal 2003 increased in absolute dollars due to a 19% increase in sales expenses related to headcount additions, principally to the Enterprise and Small/Medium Business sales forces, and a 10% increase in marketing expenses.
 
General and administrative costs include the payroll, employee benefits, and other headcount-related costs associated with the finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources, and other administrative headcount, legal fees, and other administrative fees. General and administrative costs were $300 million, or 3.8% of revenue, in the third quarter compared to $246 million, or 3.4% of revenue, in the comparable quarter of the prior year. General and administrative costs increased principally due to a 15% increase in headcount-related costs. In the first nine months of fiscal 2003, general and administrative costs were $910 million compared to $1.27 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2002. General and administrative costs included a charge of approximately $660 million in the second quarter of 2002 and $210 million in the second quarter of 2003 reflecting the Company’s estimate of costs related to resolving pending state antitrust and unfair competition consumer class action lawsuits.
 
Non-operating Items, Investment Income, and Income Taxes
 
Losses on equity investees and other incorporates Microsoft’s share of income or loss from equity method investments and income or loss attributable to minority interests. Losses on equity investees and other increased to $19 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, compared to $11 million in the comparable quarter of fiscal 2002, due to a larger loss from the Company’s equity investment in MSNBC entities and T1MSN. Losses on equity investees and other declined to $53 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2003, compared to $78 million in the comparable period of fiscal 2002. This decrease was primarily a result of a reduction in the number of equity investees through fiscal year 2002 due to divestitures of such investments.

On February 4, 2002, USA Networks, Inc. (USA) shareholders approved the merger transaction in which USA became the controlling shareholder of Expedia, Inc. As part of the transaction, Microsoft transferred all of its 33.7 million Expedia shares and warrants. In return, Microsoft received 20.1 million shares of USA common stock, 12.8 million shares of USA cumulative convertible preferred stock, and 14.2 million USA warrants. Microsoft recorded a pretax gain of $1.25 billion, which is included in net gains on the sales of investments in investment income.
 
In conjunction with the definitive agreement to combine AT&T Broadband with Comcast in a new company to be called Comcast Corporation, Microsoft exchanged its AT&T 5% convertible preferred debt for 115 million shares of Comcast Corporation on November 18, 2002, resulting in a $20 million net recognized loss.
 
Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. The Company employs a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of its investments. In the event that the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, the Company evaluates, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, as well as the Company’s intent and ability to hold the investment. The Company also considers specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
 
For the three months ended March 31, 2003, other-than-temporary impairments of $214 million were recorded due to general market conditions and $20 million due to specific adverse conditions. The $1.19 billion of other-than-temporary impairments for the three months ended March 31, 2002 were recorded due to general market conditions. For the nine months ended March 31, 2003, $885 million were recorded due to general market conditions and $204 million due to specific adverse conditions. For the nine months ended March 31, 2002, $1.79 billion were recorded due to general market conditions and $1.35 billion due to specific adverse conditions.
 
The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2003 is 33%. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal 2003 is approximately 31.9%, reflecting a one-time benefit in the second quarter of $126 million from the reversal of previously accrued taxes. The tax reversal stems from a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in December 2002 reversing a previous Tax Court ruling that had denied tax benefits on certain revenue earned from the distribution of software to foreign customers. Excluding this reversal, the effective tax rate for the first nine months would have been 33% and is expected to be 33% for the remainder of fiscal year 2003. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2002 was 32%.
 
Financial Condition
 
Cash and short-term investments totaled $46.18 billion as of March 31, 2003. Cash flow from operations was $13.11 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2003, an increase of $2.03 billion from the first nine months of the prior year. The increase reflects strong growth in operating income and collections of accounts receivable. Cash used for financing was $4.74 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2003, an increase of $4.01 billion from the first nine months of the prior year, reflecting an increase in stock repurchases and the payment of an $857 million cash dividend. During the first nine months of fiscal 2003, the Company repurchased 190.1 million shares of common stock, compared to 71.7 million shares of common stock in the comparable period of the prior year. In addition, 5.1 million shares of common stock were acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 as a result of a structured stock repurchase transaction entered into in fiscal 2001. On January 16, 2003, the Company’s Board of Directors declared

an annual dividend on Microsoft common stock of $0.08 per share, payable March 7, 2003 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 21, 2003. Cash used for investing was $7.12 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2003, a decrease of $2.02 billion from the first nine months of the prior year.
 
Microsoft has no material long-term debt. Stockholders’ equity at March 31, 2003 was $58.28 billion. Microsoft will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities and computer systems for R&D, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. Commitments for constructing new buildings were $147 million on March 31, 2003. The Company has not engaged in any transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources.
 
Management believes existing cash and short-term investments together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements. Microsoft’s philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short-term investments, as well as equity and other investments, reflects Microsoft’s views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to Microsoft’s business model. The Company continuously assesses its investment management approach in view of its current and potential future needs.
 
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
 
In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. Interpretation 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity’s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity’s residual returns or both. The consolidation requirements of Interpretation 46 apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. Certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity was established. The Company does not believe the adoption of the Interpretation will have a material impact on its financial statements.
 
Critical Accounting Policies
 
Microsoft’s financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for Microsoft include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, and accounting for income taxes.
 
Microsoft accounts for the licensing of software in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. The application of SOP 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for those elements. End users receive certain elements of the Company’s products over a period of time. These elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, the fair value of which is recognized over the product’s estimated life cycle. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.
 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 59, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than temporarily impaired. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, Microsoft evaluates, among other factors, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost; the financial health of and near-term business outlook for the investee, including factors such as industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow; and the Company’s intent and ability to hold the investment.

SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. Significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit.
 
Microsoft accounts for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including SFAS 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, and SFAS 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in creating a computer software product should be charged to expense when incurred as research and development until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when the technological feasibility of a product is established. Microsoft has determined that technological feasibility for its products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material, and accordingly, the Company expenses all research and development costs when incurred.
 
Microsoft is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. The Company evaluates, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact the Company’s financial position or its results of operations.
 
SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s financial statements or tax returns. Fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the Company’s financial position or its results of operations.

Item 2.     Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 
Results of Operations
 
Revenue
 
Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2003 was $8.54 billion, an increase of 10% over the second quarter of fiscal year 2002. The revenue growth was driven primarily by increased sales of the Microsoft Xbox video game consoles, recognition of unearned revenue from strong multi-year licensing in prior periods, and licensing of Microsoft Windows Server and Server Applications. As a result of strong multi-year licensing in the first quarter of fiscal 2003, new organizational licensing agreements declined in the second quarter compared to the prior year’s second quarter.
 
Revenue for the first six months of fiscal year 2003 was $16.29 billion, an increase of 17% over the six months of fiscal year 2002. The revenue growth was driven primarily by strong multi-year licensing prior to the Company’s transition to its new licensing program (Licensing 6.0) in the first quarter of fiscal 2003, strong OEM licensing of Microsoft Windows XP Home and Professional operating systems, sales of the Microsoft Xbox video game consoles, and new OEM licensing arrangements. Prior to the July 31, 2002 transition date to Licensing 6.0, the Company experienced a significant growth in multi-year licensing arrangements as customers enrolled in the Company’s maintenance programs, including Upgrade Advantage and Software Assurance. In addition, the Company completed its transition to new OEM licensing terms under which OEMs are billed upon their acquisition of Certificates of Authenticity (COAs) rather than upon the shipment of PCs to their customers. This transition resulted in revenue related to COA inventory accumulation at OEMs.
 
Product Revenue
 
Microsoft revised its segments for fiscal year 2003. Microsoft’s seven segments are: Client, Server Platforms, Information Worker, Business Solutions, MSN, CE/Mobility, and Home and Entertainment. The revenue amounts in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) differ from those reported in the Company’s Segment Information appearing in Note 10 of the Notes to Financial Statements because reconciling items have been allocated to those segments for purposes of MD&A. The revenue figures in the Segment Information footnote represent amounts reported internally for management reporting, while the revenue figures in the MD&A reflect revenue recognized in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
 
Client includes revenue from Windows XP Professional and Home, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows NT Workstation, Windows Me, Windows 98, and embedded systems. Client revenue was $2.54 billion in the second quarter, compared to $2.55 billion in the second quarter of the prior year. The prior year’s second quarter benefited from the launch of Windows XP Professional and Home operating systems during the quarter. Additionally, certain OEM multinationals’ inventory accumulation in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 led to fewer licenses purchased in the second quarter of fiscal 2003. Offsetting these declines, were a continued mix shift to the higher priced Windows XP Professional operating system and recognition of unearned revenue from strong multi-year licensing in prior periods. Client revenue was $5.36 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2003, representing 15% growth from the first six months of the prior year. The six month revenue growth reflected a continued mix shift to the higher priced Windows XP Professional operating system and strong multi-year licensing.
 
Server Platforms consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (CALs) for Windows Server, SQL Server, Exchange Server, Systems Management Server, Windows Terminal Server, and Small Business Server. It also includes BackOffice/Core CALs, developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier product support services, and Microsoft consulting services. The Server Platforms segment grew 12% to $1.76 billion in the second quarter, primarily driven by an increase in Windows-based server shipments and strong SQL Server growth, recognition of unearned revenue from strong multi-year licensing in prior periods, and continued growth in revenue from the Company’s Enterprise Servers. Revenue from servers and server applications including CALs grew 17% from the prior year’s second quarter led by Windows Server license growth, particularly from OEM shipments, and robust SQL Server licensing. Consulting and Premier support services were flat compared to the prior year’s second quarter. Revenue from developer tools grew 25% reflecting strength from new MSDN multi-year licensing. Training, certification, Microsoft Press and other services declined 25% from the second quarter of fiscal 2002, as a result of lower volumes of training certifications and lower book sales. Server Platforms revenue grew 13% to $3.39 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2003, driven overall by an increase in Windows-based server shipments, strong multi-year licensing, and continued deployment of the Company’s host of Enterprise Servers.

Information Worker includes revenue from Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Visio, other standalone information worker applications, SharePoint Portal Server CALs, and professional product support services. Revenue from Information Worker was $2.29 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2003, increasing 8% from the prior year’s second quarter. Office revenue growth was due to recognition of unearned revenue from strong multi-year licensing in prior periods, strong growth in OEM multinational and system builders’ Office Professional attach rates, and strong Office academic license sales. Additionally, Microsoft Project revenue growth was in excess of 40% as a result of continued adoption of the new version of Project released in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Revenue from Information Worker was $4.57 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2003, increasing 16% from the prior year’s first six months. Office revenue growth was due to the recognition of unearned revenue from a large increase in multi-year licenses signed prior to the transition to the Company’s Licensing 6.0 programs and strong growth in OEM system builder’s attach rates.
 
Business Solutions includes Microsoft Great Plains, bCentral, and Navision. Business Solutions revenue for the second quarter was $135 million compared to $73 million in the prior year’s second quarter. Business Solutions revenue for the first six months of fiscal 2003 was $241 million compared to $147 million in the prior year’s first six months. The additional sales attributable to the acquisition of Navision at the beginning of the fiscal year resulted in the majority of the revenue increase from the prior year.
 
MSN includes MSN Subscription and MSN Network services. MSN revenue totaled $459 million in the second quarter compared to $372 million in the prior year’s second quarter. MSN revenue totaled $886 million in the first six months of fiscal 2003 compared to $720 million in the prior year’s first six months. MSN Subscription revenue growth reflects an increase in both the subscriber base and the number of revenue generating subscribers due to a reduction in promotional subscriber programs. MSN Network services grew strongly as a result of performance-based advertising.
 
CE/Mobility includes Pocket PC, Handheld PC, other Mobility, and CE operating systems. Second quarter revenue totaled $22 million, compared to $17 million in the prior year’s second quarter. First six months of fiscal 2003 revenue totaled $39 million, compared to $31 million in the prior year’s first six months. The increase in revenue was driven by increased Pocket PC shipments and market acceptance of Windows CE, offset by declines in revenue from Handheld PCs.
 
Home and Entertainment includes Xbox video consoles and games, PC games, consumer software and hardware, and TV platform. Home and Entertainment revenue was $1.33 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2003, increasing 38% from $960 million in the prior year’s second quarter. Home and Entertainment revenue was $1.81 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2003, increasing from $1.23 billion in the prior year’s first six months. The revenue increase was driven by sales of Xbox video game consoles and related games which were available in all three regions, compared to the prior year in which Xbox was only available in the United States. Xbox revenue reflected a continued increase in the console installed base and growth in Xbox games and peripherals revenue. Revenue from consumer hardware and software and PC games also increased compared to a year ago.
 
Distribution Channels
 
Microsoft distributes its products primarily through OEM licenses, organizational licenses, online services and products, and retail packaged products. These distribution channels are aligned geographically with the exception of OEM customers which are generally managed centrally.
 
The Company’s three major geographic sales and marketing organizations are the Americas Region, the Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region, and the Japan and Asia-Pacific Region. For fiscal year 2003, Microsoft reorganized the alignment of countries located in the South Pacific to be included as part of the Japan and Asia-Pacific region. Prior year geographic revenue has been adjusted to conform to the current presentation. Sales of organizational licenses and retail packaged products via these channels are primarily to and through distributors and resellers.
 
OEM channel revenue represents license fees from original equipment manufacturers that pre-install Microsoft products, primarily on PCs. OEM revenue for the second quarter was $2.54 billion, up 7% from $2.39 billion in the comparable quarter of fiscal 2002. The OEM revenue growth reflects a small increase in PC shipments compared to the prior year, a strong increase in the mix of the higher priced Windows XP Professional licenses, and strength in Office and Server licensing. The growth rate was negatively impacted by certain multinationals inventory accumulation in the first quarter of 2003, which led to fewer licenses purchased in the second quarter of 2003. OEM revenue for the first six months of fiscal 2003 was $5.20 billion, up 19% from $4.37 billion in the comparable first six months of fiscal 2002. This growth reflects a modest increase in PC shipments compared to the prior year, a strong increase in the percentage mix of the higher priced Windows XP Professional licenses, and strength in Office and Server licensing.

Americas Region revenue in the second quarter was $3.26 billion, an increase of 3% compared to $3.16 billion in the prior year’s second quarter. Revenue from the United States was the primary driver of the region’s revenue growth. The revenue growth was primarily the result of Xbox sales and recognition of unearned revenue from strong multi-year licensing in prior periods for Information Worker and Server products, partially offset by strong sales of Windows XP operating systems associated with the launch of the new product version in the prior year’s second quarter. Americas Region revenue in the first six months of fiscal 2003 was $5.99 billion, an increase of 9% compared to $5.50 billion in the prior year’s first six months. Revenue from the United States was the primary driver of the region’s revenue growth. The growth was the result of Xbox sales and strong organizational licensing of Client, Information Worker, and Server products. Additionally, the Americas region revenue growth was partially offset by the inclusion of revenue in the comparable quarter and first six months of fiscal 2002 from Expedia, Inc., which was sold in the third quarter of fiscal 2002.
 
Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region revenue was $1.87 billion, increasing 32% from the $1.42 billion reported in the second quarter of the prior year. Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region revenue was $3.37 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2003, increasing 34% from the $2.52 billion reported in the first six months of the prior year. The majority of the growth was due to sales of Xbox which had not yet launched in the comparable prior year periods. The acquisition of Navision in the first quarter of 2003 led to an increase in revenue in the region compared to the prior year’s second quarter and first six months. Additionally, revenue growth also reflected recognition of unearned revenue from strong multi-year licensing in prior periods for Information Worker and Server products. The revenue growth was further aided by favorable foreign exchange rates compared to the prior year’s second quarter and first six months exchange rates. Had foreign exchange rates been constant with those of the second quarter of fiscal 2002, revenue in the region would have increased 24% instead of increasing 32%, excluding any effects of hedging gains and losses. Had foreign exchange rates been constant with those of the first six months of fiscal 2002, revenue in the region would have increased 24% instead of increasing 34%, excluding any effects of hedging gains and losses.
 
Japan and Asia-Pacific Region revenue increased 11% to $871 million from $785 million in the second quarter of the prior year. Japan and Asia-Pacific Region revenue increased 17% to $1.73 billion from $1.48 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2002. The region’s revenue increase was driven by sales of Xbox, Server products, and localized versions of Microsoft Office XP, particularly in Japan. Foreign exchange rates compared to those rates of the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2002 did not have a significant effect on the translated regional revenue.
 
Translated international revenue is affected by foreign exchange rates. The net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2003 compared to a year ago, primarily due to a stronger Euro versus the U.S. dollar. Had the rates from the prior year’s comparable quarter been in effect in the second quarter of fiscal 2003, translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been approximately $110 million lower. Had the rates from the prior year’s first six months been in effect in the first six months of fiscal 2003, translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been approximately $245 million lower. Certain manufacturing, selling, distribution, and support costs are disbursed in local currencies, and a portion of international revenue is hedged, thus offsetting a portion of the translation exposure.
 
Operating Expenses
 
Cost of revenue was $2.03 billion, or 23.8% of revenue, in the second quarter, compared to $1.54 billion, or 19.9% of revenue, in the second quarter of the prior year. The cost of sales for Xbox consoles drove the majority of the increase, both in absolute dollars, as well as percentage of revenue, offset by higher licensing revenue and lower relative product support and consulting services costs. Cost of revenue was $3.23 billion, or 19.9% of revenue, in the first six months of fiscal 2003, compared to $2.43 billion, or 17.5% of revenue, in the first six months of the prior year. The cost of sales for Xbox consoles drove the majority of the increase, both in absolute dollars, as well as percentage of revenue, offset by higher licensing revenue and lower relative MSN support and product support costs.
 
Research and development expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 were $1.12 billion, 13.1% of revenue, an increase of 7% over the second quarter of the prior year. The increase was primarily due to headcount-related costs, computer equipment and lab expenses, Xbox game development, and Server Platform product development costs. Research and development expenses for the first six months of fiscal 2003 were $2.21 billion, 13.6% of revenue, an increase of 8% over the first six months of the prior year. The increase was primarily due to headcount-related costs, product development costs, and third party development costs associated with Xbox.

Sales and marketing expenses were $1.70 billion in the second quarter, or 19.9% of revenue, compared to $1.48 billion in the second quarter of the prior year, or 19.1% of revenue. Sales and marketing costs associated with Xbox and other marketing initiatives and headcount-related costs were the primary drivers of the increase in sales and marketing expenses, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue, over the prior period’s comparable quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were $2.92 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2003, or 18.0% of revenue, compared to $2.62 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2002, or 18.9% of revenue. Sales and marketing costs associated with Xbox and headcount-related costs were the primary drivers of the increase in sales and marketing expenses over the prior period. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased for the first six months of fiscal 2003 reflecting higher marketing costs associated with Windows XP and Office XP launches in the prior year and higher current period revenue due to changes in licensing in the first quarter of fiscal 2003, partially offset by higher headcount-related costs.
 
General and administrative costs were $427 million in the second quarter compared to $833 million in the comparable quarter of the prior year. For the first six months of fiscal 2003, general and administrative costs were $610 million compared to $1.02 billion in the first six months of the prior year. General and administrative costs included a charge of approximately $660 million in the second quarter of 2002 and $210 million in the second quarter of 2003 reflecting the Company’s estimate of costs related to resolving pending state antitrust and unfair competition consumer class action lawsuits. Excluding these charges, general and administrative costs increased due to higher headcount-related costs and legal fees.
 
Non-operating Items, Investment Income/(Loss), and Income Taxes
 
Losses on equity investees and other incorporates Microsoft’s share of income or loss from equity method investments and income or loss attributable to minority interests. Losses on equity investees and other declined to $12 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2003, compared to $37 million in the comparable quarter of fiscal 2002. Losses on equity investees and other declined to $34 million in the first six months of fiscal 2003, compared to $67 million in the comparable period of fiscal 2002. These decreases were primarily a result of a reduction in the number of equity investees through fiscal year 2002 divestitures of such investments.

In conjunction with the definitive agreement to combine AT&T Broadband with Comcast in a new company to be called Comcast Corporation, Microsoft exchanged its AT&T 5% convertible preferred debt for 115 million shares of Comcast Corporation on November 18, 2002 resulting in a $20 million net recognized loss.
 
The effective tax rate for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2003 is approximately 29.5% and 31.4%, respectively, reflecting a one-time benefit in the second quarter of $126 million from the reversal of previously accrued taxes. The tax reversal stems from a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in December 2002 reversing a previous Tax Court ruling that had denied tax benefits on certain revenue earned from the distribution of software to foreign customers. Excluding this reversal, the effective tax rate for the second quarter and first six months would have been 33% and is expected to be 33% for the remainder of fiscal year 2003. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2002 was 32%.

Financial Condition
 
Cash and short-term investments totaled $43.42 billion as of December 31, 2002. Cash flow from operations was $8.94 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2003, an increase of $1.99 billion from the first six months of the prior year. The increase reflects strong growth in operating income, unearned revenue, and collections of accounts receivable. Cash used for financing was $3.53 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2003, an increase of $3.05 billion from the first six months of the prior year, reflecting an increase in stock repurchases. During the first six months of fiscal 2003, the Company repurchased 79.7 million shares of common stock, compared to 24.3 million shares of common stock in the comparable period of the prior year. In addition, 2.6 million shares of common stock were acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 as a result of a structured stock repurchase transaction entered into in fiscal 2001. Cash used for investing was $2.92 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2003, a decrease of $2.23 billion from the first six months of the prior year.
 
Microsoft has no material long-term debt. Stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2002 was $55.81 billion. Microsoft will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities and computer systems for R&D, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. Commitments for constructing new buildings were $144 million on December 31, 2002. The Company has not engaged in any transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources.
 
Management believes existing cash and short-term investments together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements. The Company’s cash and short-term investments are available for strategic investments, mergers and acquisitions, other potential large-scale needs and to fund the share repurchase program.
 
On January 16, 2003, the Company’s Board of Directors declared an annual dividend on Microsoft common stock of $0.16 per share pre-split ($0.08 post-split), payable March 7, 2003, payable to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 21, 2003. Also on January 16, 2003, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved a two-for-one split on Microsoft common stock, to shareholders of record on January 27, 2003.
 
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
 
In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation 45, Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. The Interpretation elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees, including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit. It also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee, the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value, or market value, of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements. The provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor’s obligations does not apply to product warranties or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The Company’s disclosure of guarantees is included in Note 9 of the Notes to Financial Statements. The Company believes that adoption of the recognition and measurement provisions of Interpretation 45 will not have a material impact on its financial statements.
 
In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. Interpretation 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity’s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity’s residual returns or both. The consolidation requirements of Interpretation 46 apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. Certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity was established. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of the Interpretation, but believes its adoption will not have a material impact on its financial statements.

Critical Accounting Policies
 
Microsoft’s financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for Microsoft include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, and accounting for income taxes.
 
Microsoft accounts for the licensing of software in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. The application of SOP 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for those elements. End users receive certain elements of the Company’s products over a period of time. These elements include browser technologies updates and technical support, the fair value of which is recognized over the product’s estimated life cycle. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.
 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 59, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, Microsoft evaluates, among other factors, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost; the financial health of and near-term business outlook for the investee, including factors such as industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow; and the Company’s intent and ability to hold the investment.
 
SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. Significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit.
 
Microsoft accounts for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including SFAS 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, and SFAS 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in creating a computer software product should be charged to expense when incurred as research and development until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when the technological feasibility of a product is established. Microsoft has determined that technological feasibility for its products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material, and accordingly, the Company expenses all research and development costs when incurred.
 
Microsoft is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. The Company evaluates, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact the Company’s financial position or its results of operations.
 
SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s financial statements or tax returns. Fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the Company’s financial position or its results of operations.
