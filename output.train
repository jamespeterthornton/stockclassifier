diverse customer groups , including consumers , small businesses , mid-sized companies and large corporations . these products and services are sold through various channels , including direct mail , online applications , targeted direct and third-party sales forces , and direct response advertising . the company recently created the enterprise growth group , which focuses on generating alternative sources of revenue on a global basis , both organically and through acquisitions , in areas such as online and mobile payments and fee-based services . the company Â ’ s products and services generate the following types of revenue for the company : Â • Â   discount revenue , which is the company Â ’ s largest revenue source , represents fees charged to merchants when cardmembers use their cards to purchase goods and services on the company Â ’ s network ; Â • Â   net card fees , which represent revenue earned for annual charge card memberships ; Â • Â   travel commissions and fees , which are earned by charging a transaction or management fee for airline or other travel-related transactions ; Â • Â   other commissions and fees , which are earned on foreign exchange conversions and card-related fees and assessments ; Â • Â   other revenue , which represents insurance premiums earned from cardmember travel and other insurance programs , revenues arising from contracts with global network services Â ’ ( gns ) partners ( including royalties and signing fees ) , publishing revenues and other miscellaneous revenue and fees ; and Â • Â   interest and fees on loans , which principally represents interest income earned on outstanding balances , and card fees related to the cardmember loans portfolio . in addition to funding and operating costs associated with these types of revenue , other major expense categories are related to marketing and reward programs that add new cardmembers and promote cardmember loyalty and spending , and provisions for anticipated cardmember credit and fraud losses . table of contents financial targetsthe company will seek to achieve three financial targets , on average and over time : Â • Â   revenues net of interest expense growth of at least 8 Â   percent ; Â • Â   earnings per share ( eps ) Â   growth of 12 to 15 Â   percent ; and Â • Â   return on average equity ( roe ) Â   of 25 Â   percent or more . if the company achieves its eps target as well as the roe target , it would seek to return , on average and over time , approximately 50 Â   percent of the capital it generates to shareholders as dividends or through repurchases of common stock . forward-looking statements and non-gaap measurescertain of the statements in this form 10-q are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 . refer to the Â “ forward-looking statements Â ” section below . in addition , certain calculations included within this form 10-q constitute non-gaap financial measures . the company Â ’ s calculations of non-gaap financial measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies . bank holding companythe company is a bank holding company under the bank holding company act of 1956 and the federal reserve board ( federal reserve ) is the company Â ’ s primary federal regulator . as such , the company is subject to the federal reserve Â ’ s regulations , policies and minimum capital standards . table of contents current business environment / outlookthe company Â ’ s results for the third quarter of 2011 continued to reflect strong spending growth and improved credit performance . during the quarter cardmember spending volumes grew both in the united states and internationally , and across all of the company Â ’ s businesses , despite a challenging economic environment and when being compared to relatively strong prior year performance . while the positive impacts of strong billings growth and modestly higher cardmember borrowing levels were partially offset by lower loan yields , the strong billings growth , improved credit trends and the benefit of a lower effective tax rate provided the company with the opportunity to invest in the business at significant levels and also generate strong earnings . these investments continue to be focused both on driving near-term metrics and building capabilities that will benefit the medium to long-term success of the company . the company Â ’ s improving credit trends mentioned above contributed to a reduction in loan write-offs and in loss reserve levels over the course of the third quarter of 2011 when compared to 2010 . reserve coverage ratios remain at appropriate levels after taking into consideration a reduction of approximately $ 450 Â   million in loss reserve levels during the quarter . going forward , the company expects benefits to its results from reserve releases to diminish . net interest yield declined compared to the third quarter of 2010 . the lower yield reflects lower revolving levels and lower balances at penalty rates due to the implementation of elements of the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 ( the Â “ card act Â ” ) , which were partially offset by the benefit of certain repricing initiatives effective during 2009 and 2010 . going forward , net interest yield will continue to be influenced by certain strategies the company decides to employ , such as its current focus on premium lending , as well as other factors such as the credit quality of its portfolio , the percentage of the portfolio that is revolving , the cost of funds and potential pricing changes . despite the continued momentum across the company Â ’ s businesses , the economic environment remains uncertain . the uncertain environment includes questions about the creditworthiness of sovereign issuers within europe and the strength of the european banking system . sovereign defaults or the continued concerns about european fiscal policy and unity could lead to disruptions in capital markets and increase borrowing costs for consumers and companies in europe and the united states . in addition , the company received the last settlement payment from mastercard in the second quarter , will receive the last payment from visa in the fourth quarter and faces more difficult year-over-year comparisons in light of strong 2010 and year-to-date 2011 volume and credit performance . in light of these factors , the company is continuing to implement its plan to slow the year-over-year growth of its operating expenses as it exits this year and enters 2012 . reengineering initiativesthe company expects to record additional restructuring charges in 2011 and 2012 related to employee severance obligations , other employee-related costs and lease termination costs resulting from the planned consolidation of facilities within the company Â ’ s global servicing network , which was first announced in the fourth quarter of 2010 . the expected aggregate amount of these additional charges is approximately $ 50 Â   million to $ 60 Â   million pretax ( approximately $ 32 Â   million to $ 38 Â   million after-tax ) . during the first and second quarters of 2011 , respectively , the company recorded $ 11 million ( $ 7 Â   million after-tax ) and $ 4 Â   million ( $ 2 Â   million after-tax ) of such expected additional charges . in the third quarter of 2011 , the company did not record additional charges and has lowered its estimated range of charges from a range of $ 60 Â   million to $ 80 Â   million to a range of $ 50 million to $ 60 Â   million to reflect the fact that more employees than expected have chosen to relocate to other company locations . table of contents substantially all of the reengineering activities described above are expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2012 . in the third quarter of 2011 , the company recorded $ 39 Â   million ( $ 28 Â   million after-tax ) of net additional severance related reengineering costs . acquisitionsduring the first quarter of 2011 , the company completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in loyalty partner ( march Â   1 , 2011 ) for total consideration of $ 616 Â   million ( $ 585 Â   million plus $ 31 million in cash acquired ) . in addition , the company may acquire the remaining noncontrolling equity interest over a three-year period beginning at the end of 2013 at a price based on business performance , which currently has an estimated fair value of $ 150 Â   million . loyalty partner is a leading marketing services company best known for the loyalty programs it operates in germany , poland and india . loyalty partner also provides market analysis , operating platforms and consulting services that help merchants grow their businesses . the final purchase price allocation will be completed in a subsequent quarter . refer to note 2 of the

Â   ( b ) Â   average basic cardmember spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only . average fee per card is computed based on net card fees , including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs , plus card fees included in interest and fees on loans ( including related amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs ) , divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force . the card fees related to cardmember loans included in interest and fees on loans were $ 66 Â   million and $ 58 Â   million for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively , and $ 198 Â   million and $ 157 Â   million for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively . the adjusted average fee per card , which is a non-gaap measure , is computed in the same manner , but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs ( a portion of which is charge card related and included in net card fees and a portion of which is lending related and included in interest and fees on loans ) . the amount of amortization excluded was $ 52 Â   million and $ 49 Â   million for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively , and $ 162 Â   million and $ 156 Â   million for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively . the company presents adjusted average fee per card because the company believes this metric presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of its proprietary card products . table of contents american express

Â   ( b ) Â   the company presents a net write-off rate based on principal losses only ( i . e . , excluding interest and / or fees ) to be consistent with industry convention . in addition , because the company Â ’ s practice is to include uncollectible interest and / or fees as part of its total provision for losses , a net write-off rate including principal , interest and / or fees is also presented . Â   ( c ) Â   effective january Â   1 , 2010 , the company revised the time period in which past due cardmember receivables in international card services and global commercial services are written off to when they are 180 Â   days past due or earlier , consistent with applicable bank regulatory guidance and the write-off methodology adopted for u . s . card services in the fourth quarter of 2008 . previously , receivables were written off when they were 360 Â   days past billing or earlier . therefore , the net write-offs for the first quarter of 2010 include net write-offs of approximately $ 60 Â   million for international card services and approximately $ 48 Â   million for global commercial services resulting from this write-off methodology change , which increased the net loss ratios and decreased the 90 Â   days past billing metrics for these segments , but did not have a substantial impact on provisions for losses . Â   ( d ) Â   in accordance with gaap governing accounting for consolidation of variable interest entities ( vie ) Â   effective january Â   1 , 2010 , which resulted in the consolidation of the american express credit account master trust ( the lending trust ) , $ 29 . 0 Â   billion of additional cardmember loans along with a $ 2 . 5 Â   billion loan loss reserve were recorded on the company Â ’ s consolidated balance sheets . table of contents ( e ) Â   see below for calculations of net interest yield on cardmember loans , a non-gaap measure , and net interest income divided by average loans , a gaap measure . the company believes net interest yield on cardmember loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of the company Â ’ s cardmember loan portfolio . Â   ( f ) Â   this calculation includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the cardmember loan portfolio , and thus is not representative of net

of operations and consolidated liquidity and capital resources are presented on a basis consistent with gaap unless otherwise noted . beginning the first quarter of 2011 , certain payments to business partners previously expensed in other , net expense have been reclassified as contra-revenue within discount revenue or as marketing and promotion expense . these partner payments are primarily related to certain co-brand contracts where upfront payments are amortized over the life of the contract . amounts in prior periods for this item and certain other amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation and are insignificant to the affected line items . consolidated results of operations for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2011 and 2010the company Â ’ s consolidated net income for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2011 increased $ 142 million or 13 Â   percent to $ 1 . 2 Â   billion and diluted eps increased by $ 0 . 13 to $ 1 . 03 . the company Â ’ s total revenues net of interest expense and total expenses increased by approximately 9 Â   percent and 13 Â   percent , respectively , while total provisions for losses decreased by 33 Â   percent for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2011 , as compared to the same period in the prior year . assuming no changes in foreign currency exchange rates from 2010 to 2011 , total revenues net of interest expense and total expenses increased approximately 6 Â   percent and 11 Â   percent , respectively , while provisions for losses decreased approximately 35 Â   percent in 2011 . 1 Â   1 Â   the foreign currency adjusted information , a non-gaap measure , assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into u . s . dollars ( i . e . , assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2011 apply to the period against which such results are being compared ) . the company believes the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare the company Â ’ s performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates . table of contents total revenues net of interest expenseconsolidated total revenues net of interest expense for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2011 of $ 7 . 6 Â   billion increased $ 598 Â   million or 9 Â   percent from 2010 . the increase in total revenues net of interest expense primarily reflects higher discount revenues , increased other commissions and fees , higher net card fees and higher other revenues , partially offset by slightly lower net interest income and slightly lower travel commissions and fees . discount revenue for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2011 increased $ 457 Â   million or 12 Â   percent as compared to 2010 , to $ 4 . 2 Â   billion as a result of 16 Â   percent growth in billed business volumes , partially offset by a slight decline in the average discount rate . the lower revenue growth versus total billed business growth reflects the relatively faster growth in billed business related to gns , where the company shares the discount revenue with card issuing partners , and higher contra-revenue items , including corporate incentive payments and partner payments . the average discount rate was 2 . 54 Â   percent and 2 . 56 Â   percent for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively . u . s . billed business and billed business outside the united states increased 13 Â   percent and 21 percent , respectively , for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2011 as compared to the same period in the prior year . the increase in billed business within the united states reflected an increase in average spending per proprietary basic card and an increase in basic cards-in-force . the increase in billed business outside the united states reflected an increase in average spending per proprietary basic card and basic cards-in-force . the table below summarizes selected statistics for billed business and average spend during the three months ended september Â   30 , 2011 compared to the same period in the prior year : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   2011 Â   Â

19 Â   percent in japan , asia pacific and australia , 14 Â   percent in latin america and canada , and 8 percent in europe , the middle east and africa . total cards-in-force increased 8 Â   percent worldwide due to a 21 Â   percent increase in gns , a 2 Â   percent increase in uscs , and a 1 Â   percent increase in ics . during the three months ended september Â   30 , 2011 , total cards-in-force increased by 400 , 000 in the united states and increased by 1 , 400 , 000 outside the united states compared to the second quarter of 2011 . travel commissions and fees decreased $ 3 Â   million or 1 Â   percent to $ 480 Â   million , primarily due to a benefit in the prior year related to revenue recognized from the signing of supplier contracts , partially offset by a 13 Â   percent increase in worldwide travel sales . other commissions and fees increased $ 89 Â   million or 17 Â   percent to $ 604 Â   million , primarily driven by revenues related to loyalty partner operations . other revenues increased $ 31 Â   million or 6 Â   percent to $ 534 Â   million , primarily reflecting higher gns partner royalty revenues , higher foreign exchange fees and greater merchant-related fee revenues . interest income decreased $ 40 Â   million or 2 Â   percent to $ 1 . 8 Â   billion for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2011 compared to the same period in the prior year . interest and fees on loans decreased $ 22 Â   million or 1 Â   percent , driven by a lower net yield , which was partially offset by a 3 percent increase in average cardmember loans . the lower net yield reflects lower revolving levels and lower balances at penalty rates due to the implementation of elements of the card act and improved credit performance . these reductions to yield were partially offset by the benefit of certain repricing initiatives effective during 2009 and 2010 . interest and dividends on investment securities decreased $ 35 Â   million or 34 Â   percent to $ 68 Â   million , primarily reflecting decreased investment levels . interest on deposits with banks and others increased $ 17 Â   million to $ 33 Â   million , primarily due to higher average deposit balances compared to the same period in 2010 . interest expense decreased $ 35 Â   million or 6 Â   percent to $ 575 Â   million for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 . interest on deposits decreased $ 14 Â   million or 10 Â   percent to $ 127 Â   million , as an increase in balances was more than offset by a lower cost of funds . interest on long-term debt and other decreased 6 Â   percent , reflecting a lower average long-term debt balance , partially offset by a higher effective cost of funds . provisions for lossesprovisions for losses of $ 249 Â   million for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2011 decreased $ 124 million or 33 Â   percent compared to the same period in 2010 . charge card provisions for losses increased $ 85 Â   million or 96 Â   percent , primarily driven by higher average receivable levels , higher write-offs and a release of reserves in the prior year . cardmember loans provisions for losses decreased $ 214 Â   million or 82 Â   percent to $ 48 Â   million , reflecting lower write-offs and a lower cardmember reserve requirement at the end of the third quarter of 2011 due to improving credit performance . other provisions for losses increased $ 5 Â   million or 23 Â   percent . expensesconsolidated expenses for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2011 were $ 5 . 6 Â   billion , an increase of $ 651 Â   million or 13 Â   percent from $ 5 . 0 Â   billion in 2010 . the increase reflects increased cardmember rewards expenses , increased cardmember services expenses , higher salaries and employee benefits expenses , and greater occupancy and equipment expenses , partially offset by lower marketing and promotion expenses . marketing and promotion expenses decreased $ 114 Â   million or 13 Â   percent to $ 757 Â   million for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2011 from $ 871 Â   million in 2010 due to lower product media and brand spending , in addition to slightly lower card acquisition and loyalty spending . table of contents cardmember rewards expenses increased $ 302 Â   million or 24 Â   percent to $ 1 . 6 Â   billion in 2011 from $ 1 . 3 billion in 2010 , reflecting greater rewards-related spending volumes and higher co-brand expense . in addition , higher redemptions led to a slight increase in the ultimate redemption rate estimate . cardmember services expense increased $ 48 Â   million or 34 Â   percent to $ 189 Â   million reflecting increased costs associated with new benefits made available to u . s . cardmembers . salaries and employee benefits expenses increased $ 244 Â   million or 18 Â   percent to $ 1 . 6 Â   billion for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2011 from $ 1 . 4 Â   billion in 2010 , reflecting higher employee levels , merit increases for existing employees , higher benefit-related costs , severance costs related to reengineering activities and higher incentive-related compensation . occupancy and equipment expenses for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2011 increased $ 62 million or 17 Â   percent , primarily reflecting costs associated with loyalty partner and an increase in software purchasing expense . other , net expenses for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2011 increased $ 119 Â   million or 71 percent compared to the same period in 2010 , primarily reflecting a mastercard settlement payment received in the third quarter of 2010 and expenses related to legal exposures , partially offset by benefits related to the hedging of fixed-rate debt and income statement foreign exchange exposures . income taxesthe effective tax rate from continuing operations was 28 Â   percent for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2011 compared to 33 Â   percent for the same period in 2010 . the tax rates in both periods reflect the level of pretax income in relation to recurring permanent tax benefits . in addition , the tax rate in the third quarter of 2011 includes a $ 77 Â   million tax benefit related to a distribution of foreign subsidiary earnings with associated foreign tax credits . consolidated results of operations for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2011 and 2010the company Â ’ s consolidated net income for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2011 increased $ 748 million or 25 Â   percent to $ 3 . 7 Â   billion and diluted eps , including discontinued operations , increased by $ 0 . 64 or 26 Â   percent to $ 3 . 11 . the company Â ’ s total revenues net of interest expense and total expenses increased by approximately 9 Â   percent and 17 Â   percent , respectively , while total provisions for losses decreased by 64 Â   percent for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2011 as compared to the same period in the prior year . assuming no changes in foreign currency exchange rates from 2010 to 2011 , total revenues net of interest expense and total expenses increased approximately 7 Â   percent and 15 Â   percent , respectively . 2total revenues net of interest expenseconsolidated total revenues net of interest expense for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2011 of $ 22 . 2 Â   billion were up $ 1 . 9 Â   billion or 9 Â   percent from 2010 . the increase in total revenues net of interest expense primarily reflects higher discount revenue , increased other commissions and fees , greater travel commissions and fees , higher other revenues and higher net card fees , partially offset by lower net interest income . Â   2 Â   the foreign currency adjusted information , a non-gaap measure , assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into u . s . dollars ( i . e . , assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2011 apply to the period against which such results are being compared ) . the company believes the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare the company Â ’ s performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates . table of contents discount revenue for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2011 increased $ 1 . 5 Â   billion or 14 Â   percent as compared to 2010 to $ 12 . 4 Â   billion as a result of a 17 Â   percent increase in billed business . the average discount rate was 2 . 54 Â   percent and 2 . 56 Â   percent for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively . u . s . billed business and billed business outside the united states were up 14 Â   percent and 23 percent , respectively , for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2011 . the increase in billed business within the united states reflected an increase in average spending per proprietary basic card and a slight increase in basic cards-in-force . the increase in billed business outside the united states reflected an increase in average spending per proprietary basic card and basic cards-in-force . the table below summarizes selected statistics for billed business and average spend during the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2011 compared to the same period in the prior year : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   2011 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   percentage increase Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( decrease ) assuming Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   percentage Â   Â   no changes in Â   Â   Â   increase Â   Â   foreign exchange Â   Â   Â   ( decrease ) Â   Â   rates Â   ( a ) worldwide ( b ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   billed business Â   Â   17 % Â   Â   14 % proprietary billed business Â   Â   15 Â   Â   Â   13 Â   gns billed business ( c ) Â   Â   32 Â   Â   Â   24 Â   average spending per proprietary basic card Â   Â   14 Â   Â   Â   11 Â   basic cards-in-force Â   Â   8 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   united states ( b ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   billed business Â   Â   14 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   average spending per proprietary basic card Â   Â   12 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   basic cards-in-force Â   Â   5 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   proprietary consumer card billed business ( d ) Â   Â   13 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   proprietary small business billed business ( d ) Â   Â   14 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   proprietary corporate services billed business ( e ) Â   Â   15 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   outside the united states ( b ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   billed business Â   Â   23 Â   Â   Â   14 Â   average spending per proprietary basic card Â   Â   20 Â   Â   Â   11 Â   basic cards-in-force Â   Â   12 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   proprietary consumer and small business billed business ( f ) Â   Â   19 Â   Â   Â   10 Â   proprietary corporate services billed business ( e ) Â   Â   23 Â   Â   Â   15 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( a ) Â   refer to footnote 2 on page 45 relating to changes in foreign exchange rates .

to a lesser extent , a shift in redemption mix also drove a slight increase in the weighted average cost per point . these increases in the ultimate redemption rate and weighted average cost per point , both of which impacted the expense related to points earned during the period as well as the membership rewards liability for unredeemed points at the beginning of the period , led to a more pronounced increase in rewards costs during this period than in previous periods . cardmember services expense increased $ 101 Â   million or 24 Â   percent to $ 526 Â   million for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2011 from $ 425 Â   million in 2010 , driven by higher cost associated with new benefits made available to u . s . cardmembers and higher volume-related rewards costs . salaries and employee benefits expenses increased $ 719 Â   million or 18 Â   percent to $ 4 . 7 Â   billion for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2011 from $ 4 . 0 Â   billion in 2010 , reflecting higher employee levels , merit increases for existing employees , higher benefit-related costs , severance costs related to reengineering activities and higher incentive-related compensation . professional services expenses for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2011 increased $ 200 Â   million or 11 Â   percent compared to the same period in 2010 , reflecting higher technology development expenditures including various initiatives related to digitizing the business , globalizing operating platforms , and enhancing analytical and data capabilities ; higher legal costs ; and greater third-party merchant sales-force commissions ; partially offset by lower consulting fees and collection expenses . other , net expenses for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2011 increased $ 290 Â   million compared to the same period in 2010 , primarily reflecting lower mastercard settlement payments in 2011 , increased expenses related to legal exposures , higher employee-related activity and higher travel and entertainment costs , partially offset by a benefit related to accounting for hedging the company Â ’ s fixed-rate debt . income taxesthe effective tax rate from continuing operations was 29 Â   percent for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2011 compared to 33 Â   percent for the same period in 2010 . the tax rates in both periods reflect the level of pretax income in relation to recurring permanent tax benefits . in addition , the tax rate for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2011 includes a $ 77 Â   million tax benefit related to a distribution of foreign subsidiary earnings with associated foreign tax credits and a $ 102 Â   million tax benefit related to the favorable resolution of certain prior years Â ’ tax items while the tax rate in 2010 included the impact of a $ 44 Â   million valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets associated with certain of the company Â ’ s non-u . s . travel operations . table of contents consolidated capital resources and liquiditythe company Â ’ s balance sheet management objectives are to maintain : Â • Â   a solid and flexible equity capital profile ; Â • Â   a broad , deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance its assets and meet operating requirements ; and Â • Â   liquidity programs that enable the company to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements , even in the event it is unable to raise new funds under its regular funding programs . capital strategythe company Â ’ s objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through earnings and other sources to maintain a solid equity capital base and to provide flexibility to satisfy future business growth . the company believes capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk-adjusted equity in excess of its costs will generate shareholder value . the level and composition of the company Â ’ s consolidated capital position are determined through the company Â ’ s internal capital adequacy assessment process , which reflects its business activities , as well as marketplace conditions and credit rating agency requirements . they are also influenced by subsidiary capital requirements . the company , as a bank holding company , is also subject to regulatory requirements administered by the u . s . federal banking agencies . the federal reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets , liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items . the company currently calculates and reports its capital ratios under the measurement standards commonly referred to as basel i . in june Â   2004 , the basel committee on banking supervision ( commonly referred to as basel ) published new international guidelines for determining regulatory capital ( basel ii ) . in december Â   2007 , the u . s . bank regulatory agencies jointly adopted a final rule based on basel ii . the company has adopted basel ii in certain non-u . s . jurisdictions and is currently taking steps towards basel ii implementation in the u . s . the dodd-frank reform act and a series of international capital and liquidity standards known as basel iii published by basel on december Â   16 , 2010 will in the future change these current quantitative measures . in general , these changes will involve , for the u . s . banking industry as a whole , a reduction in the types of instruments deemed to be capital along with an increase in the amount of capital that assets , liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items require . these changes will generally serve to reduce reported capital ratios compared to current capital guidelines . the specific u . s . guidelines supporting the new standards and the basel iii capital standards have not been finalized , but are generally expected to be issued within the next twelve months . in addition to these measurement changes , international and u . s . banking regulators could increase the ratio levels at which banks would be deemed to be Â “ well capitalized Â ” . table of contents the following table presents the regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio for the company and its significant bank subsidiaries , as well as additional ratios widely utilized in the marketplace , as of september Â   30 , 2011 . as noted below , certain of these ratios are based on shareholders Â ’ equity of $ 18 . 1 Â   billion as of september Â   30 , 2011 .

banking agencies and fully phased-in , will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital than prior requirements , with a greater emphasis on common equity . while final implementation of the rules related to capital ratios will be determined by the federal reserve , the company estimates that had the new rules ( as currently proposed ) been in place during the third quarter of 2011 , the reported tier 1 risk-based capital and tier 1 common risk-based ratios would decline by approximately 30 basis points . in addition , the impact of the new rules on the reported tier 1 leverage ratio would be a decline of approximately 170 basis points . the estimated impact of the basel iii rules will change over time based upon changes in the size and composition of the company Â ’ s balance sheet as well as based on the u . s . implementation of the basel iii rules ; and the estimated impact for the third quarter of 2011 is not necessarily indicative of the impact in future periods . the following provides definitions for the company Â ’ s regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio , all of which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance : risk-weighted assets table of contents tier 1 risk-based capital ratio total risk-based capital ratio tier 1 leverage ratio the following provides definitions for capital ratios widely used in the marketplace , although they may be calculated differently by different companies : tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio Â — Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   september 30 , Â   ( millions ) Â   2011 Â   total shareholders Â ’ equity Â   $ 18 , 100 Â   effect of certain items in accumulated other comprehensive income ( loss ) Â   excluded from tier 1 common

040 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   the company believes the tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio may be useful because it can be used to assess and compare the quality and composition of the company Â ’ s capital with the capital of other financial services companies . moreover , the proposed international banking capital standards known as basel iii include measures that rely on the tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio . common equity and tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets ratios the company seeks to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements ; failure to maintain minimum capital levels could affect the company Â ’ s status as a financial holding company and cause the respective regulatory agencies to take actions that could limit the company Â ’ s business operations . table of contents the company Â ’ s primary source of equity capital has been through the generation of net income . historically , capital generated through net income and other sources , such as the exercise of stock options by employees , has exceeded the growth in its capital requirements . to the extent capital has exceeded business , regulatory and rating agency requirements , the company has returned excess capital to shareholders through its regular common share dividend and share repurchase program . the company maintains certain flexibility to shift capital across its businesses as appropriate . for example , the company may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements . these infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels at the american express Â ’ parent company ( parent company ) level . share repurchases and dividendsthe company has a share repurchase program to return excess capital to shareholders . these share repurchases reduce shares outstanding and offset , in whole or part , the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans . during the three and nine months ended september Â   30 , 2011 , the company returned $ 1 . 4 Â   billion and $ 2 . 6 Â   billion , respectively , in dividends ( $ 213 Â   million and $ 646 Â   million , respectively ) and share repurchases ( $ 1 . 2 Â   billion and $ 2 . 0 Â   billion , respectively ) , which represents approximately 105 Â   percent and 60 Â   percent of total capital generated , respectively . during the third quarter of 2011 , the company continued share repurchase activities and repurchased 26 Â   million common shares at an average price of $ 46 . 55 . the company repurchased 41 Â   million shares during the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2011 . the company is executing its share repurchase program , subject to market conditions , pursuant to its capital plan to repurchase up to $ 2 . 3 billion of common shares in 2011 . since the inception of repurchase programs in december Â   1994 , 725 Â   million shares have been acquired under cumulative board authorizations to repurchase up to 770 Â   million shares . on a cumulative basis , since 1994 , the company has distributed 64 Â   percent of capital generated through share repurchases and dividends . as discussed above , the objective is to return to shareholders , on average and over time , approximately 50 Â   percent of the capital the company generates through a combination of dividends and the repurchase of common shares . funding strategythe company Â ’ s principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well-diversified funding sources to allow it to meet its maturing obligations , cost-effectively finance current and future asset growth in its global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile . the diversity of funding sources by type of debt instrument , by maturity and by investor base , among other factors , provides additional insulation from the impact of disruptions in any one type of debt , maturity or investor . the mix of the company Â ’ s funding in any period will seek to achieve cost-efficiency consistent with both maintaining diversified sources and achieving its liquidity objectives . the company Â ’ s funding strategy and activities are integrated into its asset-liability management activities . the company has in place a funding policy covering american express company and all of its subsidiaries . table of contents the company Â ’ s proprietary card businesses are the primary asset-generating businesses , with significant assets in both domestic and international cardmember receivable and lending activities . the company Â ’ s financing needs are in large part a consequence of its proprietary card-issuing businesses and the maintenance of a liquidity position to support all of its business activities , such as merchant payments . the company generally pays merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by cardmembers and therefore funds the merchant payments during the period cardmember loans and receivables are outstanding . the company also has additional financing needs associated with general corporate purposes , including acquisition activities . the company seeks to raise funds to meet all of its financing needs , including seasonal and other working capital needs , while also seeking to maintain sufficient cash and readily-marketable securities that are easily convertible to cash , in order to meet the scheduled maturities of all long-term funding obligations on a consolidated basis for a 12-month period . management does not expect to make any major funding or liquidity strategy changes in order to meet basel iii Â ’ s liquidity coverage ratio ( lcr ) Â   standard . during the third quarter of 2011 , the company issued $ 1 . 3 Â   billion of senior unsecured debt with maturity of five years and a coupon of 2 . 8 Â   percent . subsequent to september Â   30 , 2011 , the company issued ( i ) Â   an incremental c $ 200 Â   million of senior unsecured debt as part of a reopening of an existing c $ 400 Â   million note that was issued during the second quarter of 2011 , raising the amount of the total note to c $ 600 Â   million , with a maturity of five years and a coupon of 3 . 6 Â   percent , ( ii ) $ 1 . 07 Â   billion of asset-backed securities from the lending trust with a maturity of three years , which included $ 1 Â   billion of class Â   a at one-month libor plus 17 basis points and $ 73 Â   million class b at one-month libor plus 70 basis points , and ( iii ) $ 33 Â   million and $ 91 Â   million of subordinated class Â   b asset-backed securities , which had been issued and retained as part of a securitized transaction in 2008 and 2009 , respectively . the company Â ’ s equity capital and funding strategies are designed , among other things , to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies , moody Â ’ s investor services ( moody Â ’ s ) , standard & poor Â ’ s ( s & p ) , fitch ratings ( fitch ) and dominion bond rating services ( dbrs ) . such ratings help to support the company Â ’ s access to cost-effective unsecured funding as part of its overall financing programs . ratings for the company Â ’ s asset-backed securitization ( abs ) Â   activities are evaluated separately . table of contents unsecured debt ratings Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   credit agency Â   entity rated Â   short-term Â   long-term Â   outlookdbrs Â   all rated entities Â   r-1

higher interest expense on the company Â ’ s unsecured debt and asset securitizations , as well as higher fees related to borrowings under its unused lines of credit . in addition to increased funding costs , declines in credit ratings could reduce the company Â ’ s borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets . the company believes the change in its funding mix , which now includes an increasing proportion of fdic-insured ( as defined below ) u . s . retail deposits , should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on the company Â ’ s funding capacity and costs . however , downgrades to certain of the company Â ’ s unsecured debt ratings that have occurred over the last several years have not caused a permanent increase in the company Â ’ s borrowing costs or a reduction in its borrowing capacity . deposit programsthe company offers deposits within its american express centurion bank and american express bank , fsb subsidiaries ( together , the banks ) . these funds are currently insured up to $ 250 , 000 per account through the federal deposit insurance corporation ( fdic ) . the company Â ’ s ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on the banks Â ’ capital levels . the company , through fsb , has a direct deposit-taking program , personal savings from american express , to supplement its distribution of deposit products through third-party distribution channels . this program makes fdic-insured certificates of deposit ( cds ) and high-yield savings account products available directly to consumers . during the third quarter of 2011 , within u . s . retail deposits the company focused on continuing to grow both the number of accounts and the total balances outstanding on savings accounts and cds that were sourced directly with consumers through personal savings from american express . the account and balance growth of personal savings from american express replaced the maturities of cds issued through third-party distribution channels . table of contents the company held the following deposits as of : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â

Â   the weighted average remaining maturity and weighted average rate at issuance on the total portfolio of u . s . retail cds , issued through direct and third-party programs , were 19 . 4 Â   months and 2 . 5 Â   percent , respectively . asset securitization programsthe company periodically securitizes cardmember receivables and loans arising from its card business , as the securitization market provides the company with cost-effective funding . securitization of cardmember receivables and loans is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust , which in turn issues certificates or notes ( securities ) Â   collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors . the proceeds from issuance are distributed to the company , through its wholly owned subsidiaries , as consideration for the transferred assets . the receivables and loans being securitized are reported as owned assets on the company Â ’ s consolidated balance sheets and the related securities issued to third-party investors are reported as long-term debt . under the respective terms of the securitization trust agreements , the occurrence of certain triggering events could result in payment of trust expenses , establishment of reserve funds , or in a worst-case scenario , early amortization of investor certificates . during the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2011 , no triggering events occurred resulting in funding of reserve accounts or early amortization . the ability of issuers of asset-backed securities to obtain necessary credit ratings for their issuances has historically been based , in part , on qualification under the fdic Â ’ s safe harbor rule for assets transferred in securitizations . in 2009 and 2010 , the fdic issued a series of changes to its safe harbor rule , with its new final rule for its securitization safe harbor , issued in 2010 , requiring issuers to comply with a new set of requirements in order to qualify for the safe harbor . issuances out of the american express credit account master trust ( the lending trust ) are grandfathered under the new fdic final rule . the trust for the company Â ’ s cardmember charge receivable securitization ( the charge trust ) does not satisfy the criteria required to be covered by the fdic Â ’ s new safe harbor rule , nor did it meet the requirements to be covered by the safe harbor rule existing prior to 2009 . it was structured and continues to be structured such that the financial assets transferred to the charge trust would not be deemed to be property of the originating banks in the event the fdic is appointed as a receiver or conservator of the originating banks . the company has received confirmation from moody Â ’ s , s & p and fitch , which rate issuances from the charge trust , that they will continue to rate issuances from such trust in the same manner as they have historically , even though the charge trust does not satisfy the requirements to be covered by the fdic Â ’ s safe harbor rule . nevertheless , one or more of the rating agencies may ultimately conclude that in the absence of compliance with the safe harbor rule , the highest rating a charge trust security could receive would be based on the originating bank Â ’ s unsecured debt rating . if one or more rating agencies come to this conclusion , it could adversely impact the company Â ’ s capacity and cost of using its charge trust as a source of funding for its business . table of contents liquidity managementthe company Â ’ s liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of cash , readily-marketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity , such that the company can continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements , even in the event it is unable to raise new funds under its regular funding programs . the company has in place a liquidity risk policy that sets out the company Â ’ s approach to managing liquidity risk on an enterprise-wide basis . the company incurs and accepts liquidity risk arising in the normal course of offering its products and services . the liquidity risks that the company is exposed to can arise from a variety of sources , and thus its liquidity management strategy includes a variety of parameters , assessments and guidelines , including but not limited to : Â • Â   maintaining a diversified set of funding sources ( refer to funding strategy section for more details ) ; Â • Â   maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off-balance sheet liquidity sources ; and Â • Â   projecting cash inflows and outflows from a variety of sources and under a variety of scenarios , including contingent liquidity exposures such as unused cardmember lines of credit and collateral requirements for derivative transactions . the company Â ’ s current liquidity target is to have adequate liquidity in the form of excess cash and readily-marketable securities that are easily convertible into cash to satisfy all maturing long-term funding obligations for a 12-month period . in addition to its cash and readily-marketable securities , the company maintains a variety of contingent liquidity resources , such as access to secured borrowings through its undrawn amount under the conduit facility and the federal reserve discount window as well as committed bank credit facilities . as of september Â   30 , 2011 , the company Â ’ s excess cash and readily-marketable securities available to fund long-term maturities were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( billions ) Â   total Â   cash Â   $ 19 .

and cash equivalents , less $ 5 . 4 Â   billion of cash available to fund day-to-day operations . cash also includes $ 26 Â   million classified as other assets on the company Â ’ s consolidated balance sheets , which is held against certain forthcoming asset-backed securitization maturities . Â   ( b ) Â   consists of certain available-for-sale investment securities ( u . s . treasury and agency securities , and government-guaranteed debt ) that are considered highly liquid . Â   ( c ) Â   consists of commercial paper and u . s . retail cds with original maturities of three and six months . the upcoming approximate maturities of the company Â ’ s long-term unsecured debt , debt issued in connection with asset-backed securitizations and long-term certificates of deposit are as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( billions ) Â   debt maturities Â   Â   unsecured Â   Â   asset-backed Â   Â   certificates of Â   Â   Â   quarter ending : Â   debt Â   Â   securitizations Â   Â   deposit Â   Â   totaldecember Â   31 , 2011 Â   $ 6 . 9 Â   Â   $ Â — Â   Â   $ 1 . 3 Â   Â   $ 8 . 2march Â   31 , 2012 Â   Â   1 . 0 Â   Â   Â   0 . 5 Â   Â   Â   1 . 2 Â   Â   Â   2 . 7june Â   30 , 2012 Â   Â   1 . 2 Â   Â   Â   2 . 0 Â   Â   Â   0 . 8 Â   Â   Â   4 . 0september Â   30 , 2012 Â   Â   0 . 6 Â   Â   Â   3 . 2 Â   Â   Â   0 . 4 Â   Â   Â   4 . 2 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   total Â   $ 9 . 7 Â   Â   $ 5 . 7 Â   Â   $ 3 . 7 Â   Â   $ 19 . 1 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   the company Â ’ s financing needs for the next 12 Â   months are expected to arise from these debt and deposit maturities as well as changes in business needs , including changes in outstanding cardmember loans and receivables as well as acquisition activities . table of contents the company considers various factors in determining the amount of liquidity it maintains , such as economic and financial market conditions , seasonality in business operations , growth in its businesses , potential acquisitions or dispositions , the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources , and regulatory and credit rating agency considerations . the yield the company receives on its cash and readily-marketable securities is , generally , less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances . thus , the company incurs substantial net interest costs on these amounts . the level of net interest costs will be dependent on the size of the company Â ’ s cash and readily-marketable securities holdings , as well as the difference between its cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields . securitized borrowing capacitythe company maintained a $ 3 . 0 Â   billion committed , revolving , secured financing facility sponsored by and with liquidity backup provided by a syndicate of banks as of september Â   30 , 2011 . the facility is used in the ordinary course of business to fund seasonal working capital needs , as well as further enhance the company Â ’ s contingent funding resources . federal reserve discount windowthe banks are insured depository institutions that have the capability of borrowing from the federal reserve bank of san francisco , subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that they may pledge . the federal reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowing made through the discount window . whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window , and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral , remain in the discretion of the federal reserve . the company had approximately $ 34 . 5 Â   billion in u . s . credit card loans and charge card receivables as of september Â   30 , 2011 that could be sold over time through its existing securitization trusts , or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity , subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria . committed bank credit facilitiesthe company maintained committed bank credit facilities as of september Â   30 , 2011 , as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( billions ) Â   parent company Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   credco Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   total ( a ) committed ( b ) Â   $ 0 . 8 Â   Â   $ 6 . 6 Â   Â   $ 7 . 4outstanding Â   $ Â — Â   Â   $ 4 . 5 Â   Â   $ 4 . 5 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( a ) Â   does not include the $ 3 . 0 Â   billion secured borrowing capacity described above .

. 1 Â   billion on its australian syndicated credit facility and on the same day entered into a new credit facility agreement for aud $ 4 . 5 billion , which was fully drawn . table of contents certain other off-balance sheet arrangementsas of september Â   30 , 2011 , the company had approximately $ 238 Â   billion of unused credit available to cardmembers as part of established lending product agreements . total unused credit available to cardmembers does not represent potential future cash requirements , as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn . the company Â ’ s charge card products have no pre-set limit and , therefore , are not reflected in unused credit available to cardmembers . cash flowscash flows from operating activitiescash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for ( i ) Â   non-cash items included in net income , including provisions for losses , depreciation and amortization , deferred taxes , and stock-based compensation and ( ii ) Â   changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities , which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of various payments . for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2011 , net cash provided by operating activities of $ 7 . 0 billion decreased $ 239 Â   million compared to $ 7 . 2 Â   billion for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 due to lower provisions for losses and changes in accounts payable and other liabilities , partially offset by higher net income and deferred taxes and other in 2011 and changes in other receivables and other assets . cash flows from investing activitiesthe company Â ’ s investing activities primarily include funding cardmember loans and receivables and the company Â ’ s available-for-sale investment portfolio . for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2011 , net cash provided by investing activities of $ 4 . 9 billion decreased $ 352 Â   million compared to $ 5 . 3 Â   billion for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 due to a reduction in maturities , redemptions and sales of investments and a net increase in cardmember loans and receivables , partially offset by lower purchases of investments and a higher change in restricted cash in 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010 . cash flows from financing activitiesthe company Â ’ s financing activities primarily include issuing and repaying debt , taking customer deposits , issuing and repurchasing its common shares , and paying dividends . for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2011 , net cash used in financing activities of $ 3 . 3 Â   billion decreased $ 4 . 6 Â   billion compared to $ 7 . 9 Â   billion for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 due to an increase in the issuance of long-term debt , an increase in customer deposits and higher net changes in short-term borrowings , partially offset by an increase in principal payments on long-term debt and cash outflows related to the repurchase of common shares in 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010 . table of contents certain legislative , regulatory and other developmentsas a participant in the financial services industry , the company is subject to a wide array of regulations applicable to its businesses . as a bank holding company and a financial holding company , the company is subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by the federal reserve and to a range of laws and regulations that impact its business and operations . in addition , the extreme disruptions in the capital markets that commenced in mid-2007 and the resulting instability and failure and near failure of numerous financial institutions , as well as reports of widespread consumer abuse , have led to a number of changes in the financial services industry , including more intense supervision , enhanced enforcement activity , significant additional regulation and the formation of additional regulatory bodies . although the long-term impact on the company of much of the recent and pending legislative and regulatory initiatives remains uncertain , the company expects that compliance requirements and expenditures will continue to rise for financial services firms , including the company , as the legislation and rules become effective and implemented over the course of the next several years . the card actthe company is subject to the provisions of the legislation known as the card act , which was enacted in may Â   2009 to fundamentally reform credit card billing practices , pricing and disclosure requirements . this legislation accelerated the effective date and expanded the scope of amendments to the rules regarding unfair or deceptive acts or practices ( udap ) Â   and the truth in lending act that restrict certain credit and charge card practices and require expanded disclosures to consumers , which were adopted in december Â   2008 in the united states . together , the legislation and the regulatory amendments include , among other matters , rules relating to the imposition by card issuers of interest rate increases on outstanding balances and the allocation of payments in respect of outstanding balances with different interest rates . certain other provisions of the card act require penalty fees to be reasonable and proportional in relation to the circumstances for which such fees are levied and require issuers to evaluate past interest rate increases twice per year to determine whether it is appropriate to reduce such increases . the company has made changes to its product terms and practices that are designed to comply with the card act , while mitigating the impact on company revenue of the changes required by the card act and the regulatory amendments . these changes include instituting product-specific increases in pricing on purchases and cash advances , modifying the criteria pursuant to which the penalty rate of interest is imposed on a cardmember and assessing late fees on certain charge products at an earlier date than previously assessed . although the company believes its actions to mitigate the impact of the card act have , to date , been largely effective ( as evidenced in part by the net interest yield for its u . s . lending portfolio ) , the impacts of certain other provisions of the card act are still subject to some uncertainty ( such as the requirement to periodically reevaluate annual percentage rate ( apr ) Â   increases ) . accordingly , in the event the actions undertaken by the company to date to offset the impact of the new legislation and regulations are not ultimately effective , they could have a material adverse effect on the company Â ’ s results of operations , including its revenue and net income . dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection actin july Â   2010 , president obama signed into law the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( the dodd-frank reform act ) . the dodd-frank reform act is comprehensive in scope and contains a wide array of provisions intended to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets . among other matters , the law creates a new independent consumer financial protection bureau ( the bureau ) , which has broad rulemaking authority over providers of credit , savings , payment and other consumer financial products and services with respect to certain federal consumer financial laws . moreover , the bureau has examination and enforcement authority with respect to certain federal consumer financial laws for some providers of consumer financial products and services , including the company and its insured depository institution subsidiaries . the bureau is directed to prohibit Â “ unfair , deceptive or abusive Â ” practices , and to ensure that all consumers have access to fair , transparent and competitive markets for consumer financial products and services . table of contents the dodd-frank reform act prohibits payment card networks from restricting a merchant from offering discounts or incentives to customers in order to encourage them to use a particular form of payment , or from restricting a merchant from setting certain minimum and maximum transaction amounts for credit cards , as long as any such discounts or incentives or any minimum or maximum transaction amounts do not discriminate among issuers or networks and comply with applicable federal or state disclosure requirements . under the dodd-frank reform act , the federal reserve is also authorized to regulate interchange fees paid to banks on debit card and certain general-use prepaid card transactions to ensure that they are Â “ reasonable and proportional Â ” to the cost of processing individual transactions , and to prohibit payment card networks and issuers from requiring transactions to be processed on a single payment network or fewer than two unaffiliated networks . the federal reserve issued its final rule on june Â   29 , 2011 , which provides that the regulations on interchange and routing do not apply to a three-party network like american express when it acts as both the issuer and the network for its prepaid cards , and is therefore not a Â “ payment card network Â ” as that term is defined and used for the specific purposes of this final rule . the dodd-frank reform act also authorizes the federal reserve to establish heightened capital , leverage and liquidity standards , risk management requirements , concentration limits on credit exposures , mandatory resolution plans ( so-called Â “ living wills Â ” ) and stress tests for , among others , large bank holding companies , such as the company , that have greater than $ 50 Â   billion in assets . in addition , certain derivative transactions will be required to be centrally cleared , which may create or increase collateral posting requirements for the company . many provisions of the dodd-frank reform act require the adoption of rules for implementation . in addition , the dodd-frank reform act mandates multiple studies , which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action . these new rules and studies will be implemented and undertaken over a period of several years . accordingly , the ultimate consequences of the dodd-frank reform act and its implementing regulations on the company Â ’ s business , results of operations and financial condition are uncertain at this time . other legislative and regulatory initiativesthe credit and charge card sector also faces continuing scrutiny in connection with the fees merchants pay to accept cards . regulators and legislators outside the united states have focused on the way bankcard network members collectively set the Â “ interchange Â ” ( that is , the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuing bank in Â “ four party Â ” payment networks , like visa and mastercard ) and legislation was previously introduced in congress designed to give merchants antitrust immunity to negotiate interchange collectively with card networks and to regulate certain card network practices . although , unlike the visa and mastercard networks , the american express network does not collectively set fees , antitrust actions and government regulation relating to merchant pricing could ultimately affect all networks . in certain countries , such as australia , and in europe where merchants in some member states are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases , regulators are investigating excessive surcharging by merchants , a practice which , if it becomes widespread , could have a material adverse effect on american express Â ’ business . in the european union ( the eu ) , the consumer rights directive , which was adopted by the eu council of ministers in october Â   2011 , would prohibit merchants from surcharging card purchases more than the merchants Â ’ cost of acceptance . the eu member states have two years to adopt this legislation . in addition to the provisions of the dodd-frank reform act regarding merchants Â ’ ability to offer discounts or incentives to encourage customers Â ’ use of a particular form of payment , a number of u . s . states are also considering legislation that would prohibit card networks from imposing similar conditions and restrictions on merchants . table of contents also , other countries in which the company operates have been considering and in some cases adopting similar legislation and rules that would impose changes on certain practices of card issuers , merchant acquirers and bankcard networks . any or all of the above changes to the legal and regulatory environment in which the company operates could have a material adverse effect on the company Â ’ s results of operations . refer to Â “ consolidated capital resources and liquidity Â ” for a discussion of the series of international capital and liquidity standards published by basel . table of contents business segment resultsbeginning in the first quarter of 2011 , the company changed its segment allocation methodology to better align segment reporting with the company Â ’ s previously announced management reorganization , which has been implemented over the last several quarters . the reorganization included the formation of the enterprise growth group , which is reported in the corporate & other segment . starting in the first quarter of 2011 , certain business activities such as loyalty edge and global foreign exchange services that were previously managed and reported in the uscs and gcs operating segments , respectively , are now managed by enterprise growth and reported in the corporate & other segment . the reorganization also included consolidation of certain corporate support functions into the global services organization . greater centralization of activities has led to modifications in the costs being allocated from the corporate & other segment to the reported operating segments starting in the first quarter of 2011 . prior period segment results have been revised for these changes . in addition , beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010 , the company completed its conversion to a new general ledger platform . this conversion enabled the company to streamline its ledger reporting unit structure , resulting in a reconfiguration of intercompany accounts . these changes have the effect of altering intercompany balances among segments , thus altering reported total segment assets . total segment assets presented since the first quarter of 2011 reflect the changes described above . this conversion had no impact on segment results , segment capital or return on segment capital metrics . u . s . card services Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   three months ended Â   Â   nine months ended Â   Â

4 percent to $ 3 . 8 Â   billion and $ 11 . 2 Â   billion for the three and nine months ended september Â   30 , 2011 , respectively , primarily driven by higher discount revenue , higher travel

percent and $ 614 million or 8 Â   percent to $ 2 . 7 Â   billion and $ 7 . 9 Â   billion for the three and nine months ended september 30 , 2011 , respectively , primarily due to higher discount revenue resulting from billed business growth and higher travel commissions and fees due to an increase in travel sales , partially offset by lower other commissions and fees due to reduced conversion revenues . billed business for the three and nine months ended september Â   30 , 2011 increased 12 Â   percent and 13 Â   percent , primarily driven by a 10 Â   percent and 11 Â   percent higher average spending per proprietary basic cards-in-force , as compared to the same periods in the prior year . interest income of $ 1 . 3 Â   billion and $ 3 . 9 Â   billion for the three and nine months

three and nine months ended september Â   30 , 2011 , respectively , driven by increased rewards costs , which reflect greater rewards-related spending volumes , higher co-brand expense and an increase in the ultimate redemption rate estimate . in addition , cardmember service costs increased as a result of new benefits offered to cardmembers . these increases were partially offset by lower marketing and promotion costs due to lower product media spending and slightly lower card acquisition and loyalty spending . salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses of $ 898 Â   million for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2011 decreased $ 5 Â   million or 1 Â   percent , reflecting lower collections costs from outside agencies and a benefit related to hedging the

billion for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2011 , increased $ 144 Â   million or 6 Â   percent , reflecting investments in various customer service initiatives , reduced benefits related to

< date > 2011-03-31 < / date > < price > 45 . 20 < / price > < company > axp < / company > american express is a global service company that provides customers with access to products , insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success . the company Â ’ s principal products and services are charge and credit payment card products and travel-related services offered to consumers and businesses around the world . the company Â ’ s range of products and services include : Â • Â   charge and credit card products ; Â   Â • Â   expense management products and services ; Â   Â • Â   consumer and business travel services ; Â   Â • Â   stored value products such as travelers cheques and other prepaid products ; Â   Â • Â   network services ; Â   Â • Â   merchant acquisition and processing , point-of-sale , servicing and settlement , and marketing and information products and services for merchants ; and Â   Â • Â   fee services , including market and trend analyses and related consulting services , fraud prevention services , and the design of customized customer loyalty and rewards programs . the company Â ’ s products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups , including consumers , small businesses , mid-sized companies and large corporations . these products and services are sold through various channels , including direct mail , on-line applications , targeted direct and third-party sales forces , and direct response advertising . the company recently created the enterprise growth group which focuses on generating alternative sources of revenue on a global basis , both organically and through acquisitions , in areas such as online and mobile payments and fee-based services . the company Â ’ s products and services generate the following types of revenue for the company : Â • Â   discount revenue , which is the company Â ’ s largest revenue source , represents fees charged to merchants when cardmembers use their cards to purchase goods and services on the company Â ’ s network ; Â   Â • Â   net card fees , which represent revenue earned for annual charge card memberships ; Â   Â • Â   travel commissions and fees , which are earned by charging a transaction or management fee for airline or other travel-related transactions ; Â   Â • Â   other commissions and fees , which are earned on foreign exchange conversions and card-related fees and assessments ; Â   Â • Â   other revenue , which represents insurance premiums earned from cardmember travel and other insurance programs , revenues arising from contracts with global network services Â ’ ( gns ) partners ( including royalties and signing fees ) , publishing revenues and other miscellaneous revenue and fees ; and Â   Â • Â   interest and fees on loans , which principally represents interest income earned on outstanding balances , and card fees related to the cardmember loans portfolio . table of contents in addition to funding and operating costs associated with these types of revenue , other major expense categories are related to marketing and reward programs that add new cardmembers and promote cardmember loyalty and spending , and provisions for anticipated cardmember credit and fraud losses . going forward , the company will seek to achieve three financial targets , on average and over time : Â • Â   revenues net of interest expense growth of at least 8 Â   percent ; Â   Â • Â   earnings per share ( eps ) Â   growth of 12 to 15 Â   percent ; and Â   Â • Â   return on average equity ( roe ) Â   of 25 Â   percent or more . the company is retaining its historical on average and over time revenue and earnings growth targets . however , evolving market , regulatory and debt investor expectations will likely cause the company , as well as other financial institutions , to maintain in future years a higher level of capital than they have historically maintained . these higher capital requirements would in turn lead , all other things being equal , to lower future roe than the company has historically targeted . in addition , the company recognizes it may need to maintain higher capital levels to support acquisitions that can augment its business growth . in combination , these factors led the company to revise its on average and over time roe financial target in 2010 to 25 Â   percent or more . in establishing its revised roe target , the company is currently targeting a tier 1 common ratio of 10 to 11 Â   percent . if the company achieves its eps target as well as the revised roe target , it would seek to return , on average and over time , approximately 50 Â   percent of the capital it generates to shareholders as a dividend or through the repurchase of common stock . certain of the statements in this form 10-q are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 . refer to the Â “ forward-looking statements Â ” section below . bank holding companythe company is a bank holding company under the bank holding company act of 1956 and the federal reserve board ( federal reserve ) is the company Â ’ s primary federal regulator . as such , the company is subject to the federal reserve Â ’ s regulations , policies and minimum capital standards . current business environment / outlookthe company Â ’ s results for the first quarter of 2011 continued to reflect strong spending growth and improved credit performance . during the quarter cardmember spending volumes grew both in the united states and internationally , and across all of the company Â ’ s businesses . during the first quarter of 2011 , the divergence between the company Â ’ s strong growth in consumer spending and relatively flat borrowing levels continued to illustrate the post-recession change in customer behavior , as well as the company Â ’ s strategic shift in focus to more premium lending customers . while the positive impact of stronger billings growth was partially offset by lower loan yields , the strong billings growth and improved credit trends again provided the company with the opportunity to invest in the business at significant levels and also generate strong earnings . these investments continue to be focused on driving near-term metrics , and building capabilities that will benefit the medium to long-term success of the company . these investments are reflected not only in marketing and other operating expenses , but also involve using the company Â ’ s strong capital base for acquisitions such as loyalty partner , discussed further in Â “ acquisitions Â ” below . the company also continued to invest in its rewards programs . during the first quarter rewards costs rose significantly , reflecting greater spending volumes and higher co-brand expense , as well as a higher redemption rate estimate for current program participants reflecting an increase in redemption patterns based on greater customer engagement . table of contents the company Â ’ s improving credit trends mentioned above contributed to a reduction in loan and receivable write-offs and in loss reserve levels over the course of the first quarter of 2011 when compared to 2010 . despite a reduction of approximately $ 700 Â   million in loss reserve levels during the quarter , reserve coverage ratios remain at appropriate levels . going forward , the company expects benefits to its results from reserve releases to diminish ; in addition , the company expects the lending write-off rate through 2011 and into 2012 to remain below average historical levels over the last ten years . net interest yield declined compared to the first quarter of 2010 . the lower yield reflects higher payment rates and lower revolving levels , and the implementation of elements of the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 ( the Â “ card act Â ” ) , which were partially offset by the benefit of certain repricing initiatives effective during 2009 and 2010 . the company expects the net interest yield in the u . s . consumer business to decline , moving closer to historic levels , but this remains subject to uncertainties such as cardmember behavior and the requirement under the card act to periodically reevaluate annual percentage rate ( apr ) Â   increases . despite strong momentum across the company Â ’ s businesses , the economic and regulatory environments remain uncertain . in addition , during 2011 the company will stop receiving quarterly visa and mastercard litigation payments , and favorable year-over-year comparisons will be more difficult in light of the strong 2010 credit and volume trends . in light of these factors , the company is moving forward with plans to slow the growth of its operating expenses toward the end of 2011 and into 2012 . reengineering initiativeson january Â   19 , 2011 , the company announced that it was undertaking various reengineering initiatives resulting in charges aggregating approximately $ 113 Â   million pretax ( approximately $ 74 million after-tax ) , which were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 . these charges include a fourth quarter restructuring charge of approximately $ 98 Â   million pretax ( $ 63 Â   million after-tax ) relating to employee severance obligations and other employee-related costs resulting from the planned consolidation of facilities within the company Â ’ s global servicing network . as noted previously , the reengineering activities are expected to result in the elimination of approximately 3 , 500 jobs in the aggregate ( including approximately 3 , 200 jobs relating to the restructuring charge described in the preceding sentence ) ; however , overall staffing levels are expected to decrease only by approximately 550 positions on a net basis as new employees are hired at the locations to which work is being transferred . during 2011 , the company expects to record restructuring charges in one or more quarterly periods relating to the reengineering activities described above in the aggregate amount of approximately $ 60 Â   million to $ 80 Â   million pretax ( approximately $ 38 Â   million to $ 51 Â   million after-tax ) . during the first quarter of 2011 , the company recorded $ 11 Â   million ( $ 7 Â   million after-tax ) of such additional charges . substantially all of the reengineering activities are expected to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of 2011 . acquisitionsduring the first quarter of 2011 , the company completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in loyalty partner ( march Â   1 , 2011 ) for total consideration of $ 616 Â   million ( $ 585 Â   million plus $ 31 million in cash acquired ) . in addition , the company may acquire the remaining noncontrolling equity interest over the next five years at a price based on business performance , which currently has an estimated fair value of $ 150 Â   million . loyalty partner is a leading marketing services company best known for the loyalty programs it operates in germany , poland and india . loyalty partner also provides market analysis , operating platforms and consulting services that help merchants grow their businesses . the purchase price allocation will be finalized in a subsequent quarter . refer to note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for further information . table of contents american express companyrefer to Â “ glossary of selected terminology Â ” for the definitions of certain key terms and related information appearing in the tables below .

Â   ( b ) Â   average basic cardmember spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only . average fee per card is computed based on net card fees , including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs , plus card fees included in interest and fees on loans ( including related amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs ) , divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force . the card fees related to cardmember loans included in interest and fees on loans were $ 64 Â   million and $ 51 Â   million for the three months ended march Â   31 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively . the adjusted average fee per card is computed in the same manner , but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs ( a portion of which is charge card related and included in net card fees and a portion of which is lending related and included in interest and fees on loans ) . the amount of amortization excluded was $ 54 Â   million and $ 51 Â   million for the three months ended march Â   31 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively . the company presents adjusted average fee per card because management believes this metric presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of its proprietary card products . table of contents american express company Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   as of or for the three months ended march 31 , Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( billions , except percentages and where indicated ) Â   2011 Â   Â   2010 Â   worldwide cardmember receivables Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   total receivables Â   $ 37 . 7 Â   Â   $ 33 . 7 Â   loss reserves ( millions ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   beginning balance Â   $ 386 Â   Â   $ 546 Â   provision for losses on authorized transactions ( a ) Â   Â   160 Â   Â   Â   184 Â   net write-offs Â   Â   ( 132 ) Â   Â   ( 244 ) other Â   Â   7 Â   Â   Â   12 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ending balance Â   $ 421 Â   Â   $ 498 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   % of receivables Â   Â   1 . 1 % Â   Â   1 . 5 % net write-off rate Â — uscs Â   Â   1 . 7 % Â   Â   1 . 7 % 30 Â   days past due as a % of total Â — uscs Â   Â   1 . 8 % Â   Â   1 . 9 % net loss ratio as a % of charge volume Â — ics / gcs ( b ) Â   Â   0 . 09 % Â   Â   0 . 38 % 90 Â   days past billing as a % of total Â — ics / gcs ( b ) Â   Â   0 . 8 % Â   Â   0 . 9 % Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   worldwide cardmember loans Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   total loans Â   $ 57 . 8 Â   Â   $ 57 . 6 Â   30 Â   days past due as a % of total Â   Â   1 . 9 % Â   Â   3 . 3 % loss reserves ( millions ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   beginning balance Â   $ 3 , 646 Â   Â   $ 3 , 268 Â   adoption of gaap consolidation standard ( c ) Â   Â   Â — Â   Â   Â   2 , 531 Â   provision for losses on authorized transactions Â   Â   ( 139 ) Â   Â   670 Â   net write-offs Â — principal Â   Â   ( 535 ) Â   Â   ( 1 , 035 ) write-offs Â — interest and fees Â   Â   ( 61 ) Â   Â   ( 114 ) other Â   Â   10 Â   Â   Â   ( 6 ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ending balance Â   $ 2 , 921 Â   Â   $ 5 , 314 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ending reserves Â — principal Â   $ 2 , 839 Â   Â   $ 5 , 161 Â   ending reserves Â — interest and fees Â   $ 82 Â   Â   $ 153 Â   % of loans Â   Â   5 . 1 % Â   Â   9 . 2 % % of past due Â   Â   263 % Â   Â   277 % average loans Â   $ 58 . 5 Â   Â   $ 59 . 3 Â   net write-off rate Â   Â   3 . 7 % Â   Â   7 . 0 % net interest income divided by average loans ( d ) ( e ) Â   Â   7 . 9 % Â   Â   8 . 9 % net interest yield on cardmember loans ( d ) Â   Â   9 . 2 % Â   Â   10 . 3 % Â   Â   ( a ) Â   represents loss provisions for cardmember receivables consisting of principal ( resulting from authorized transactions ) and fee reserve components . Â   ( b ) Â   effective january Â   1 , 2010 , the company revised the time period in which past due cardmember receivables in international card services and global commercial services are written off to when they are 180 Â   days past due or earlier , consistent with applicable bank regulatory guidance and the write-off methodology adopted for u . s . card services in the fourth quarter of 2008 . previously , receivables were written off when they were 360 Â   days past billing or earlier . therefore , the net write-offs for the first quarter of 2010 include net write-offs of approximately $ 60 Â   million for international card services and approximately $ 48 Â   million for global commercial services resulting from this write-off methodology change , which increased the net loss ratios and decreased the 90 Â   days past billing metrics for these segments , but did not have a substantial impact on provisions for losses . if these amounts had been excluded from net write-offs , the combined net loss ratio for international card services / global commercial services for the first quarter of 2010 would have been 0 . 13 Â   percent .

Â   ( d ) Â   see below for calculations of net interest yield on cardmember loans , a non-gaap measure , and net interest income divided by average loans , a gaap measure . the company believes net interest yield on cardmember loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of the company Â ’ s cardmember loan portfolio . Â   ( e ) Â   this calculation includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the cardmember loan portfolio , and thus is not representative of net interest yield on cardmember loans . the calculation includes interest income and interest expense attributable to investment securities and other interest-bearing deposits as well as to cardmember loans , and interest expense attributable to other activities , including cardmember receivables . table of contents american express companycalculation of net interest yield on cardmember loans Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   three months ended march 31 , Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( millions , except percentages and where indicated ) Â   2011 Â   Â   2010 Â   net interest income Â   $ 1 , 134 Â   Â   $ 1 , 307 Â   average loans ( billions ) Â   $ 58 . 5 Â   Â   $ 59 . 3 Â   adjusted net interest income Â   $ 1 , 326 Â   Â   $ 1 , 498 Â   adjusted average loans ( billions ) Â   $ 58 . 3 Â   Â   $ 59 . 2 Â   net interest income divided by average loans ( a ) Â   Â   7 . 9 % Â   Â   8 . 9 % net interest yield on cardmember loans Â   Â   9 . 2 % Â   Â   10 . 3 % Â   Â   ( a ) Â   refer to Â “ selected statistical information Â ” , footnote ( e ) Â   on page 33 . the following discussions regarding consolidated results of operations and consolidated liquidity and capital resources are presented on a basis consistent with gaap unless otherwise noted . beginning the first quarter of 2011 , certain payments to business partners previously expensed in other , net expense have been reclassified as contra-revenue within discount revenue or as marketing and promotion expense . these partner payments are primarily related to certain co-brand contracts where upfront payments are amortized over the life of the contract . amounts in prior periods for this item and certain other amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation and are insignificant to the affected line items . consolidated results of operations for the three months ended march Â   31 , 2011 and 2010the company Â ’ s consolidated net income for the three months ended march Â   31 , 2011 increased $ 292 million or 33 Â   percent to $ 1 . 2 Â   billion and diluted eps increased by $ 0 . 24 to $ 0 . 97 . the company Â ’ s total revenues net of interest expense and total expenses increased by approximately 7 Â   percent and 19 Â   percent , respectively , while total provisions for losses decreased by 90 Â   percent for the three months ended march Â   31 , 2011 as compared to the same period in the prior year . assuming no changes in foreign currency exchange rates from 2010 to 2011 , total revenues net of interest expense and total expenses increased approximately 5 Â   percent and 17 Â   percent , respectively , while provisions for losses decreased approximately 90 Â   percent in 20111total revenues net of interest expenseconsolidated total revenues net of interest expense for the three months ended march Â   31 , 2011 of $ 7 . 0 Â   billion were up $ 471 Â   million or 7 Â   percent from 2010 . the increase in total revenues net of interest expense primarily reflects higher discount revenues , greater travel commissions and fees , higher other revenue , increased other commissions and fees and higher net card fees , partially offset by lower net interest income . discount revenue for the three months ended march Â   31 , 2011 increased $ 480 Â   million or 14 Â   percent as compared to 2010 to $ 3 . 9 Â   billion as a result of a 17 Â   percent increase in billed business . the lower revenue growth versus total billed business growth reflects the relatively faster growth in billed business related to gns , where discount revenue is shared with card issuing partners , and higher contra-revenues , including corporate incentive payments , partner payments and cash back rewards costs . the average discount rate was 2 . 55 Â   percent for both the three months ended march Â   31 , 2011 and 2010 .

worldwide travel sales . table of contents other commissions and fees increased $ 29 Â   million or 6 Â   percent to $ 529 Â   million , driven primarily by greater foreign currency conversion revenues related to higher spending and revenues related to loyalty partner operations , partially offset by lower delinquency fees . other revenues increased $ 50 Â   million or 12 Â   percent to $ 475 Â   million , primarily reflecting higher gns partner royalty revenues , higher merchant-related fee revenues , higher foreign exchange fees and higher global prepaid and publishing revenues , partially offset by reduced insurance revenues . interest income decreased $ 178 Â   million or 9 Â   percent to $ 1 . 7 Â   billion for the three months ended march Â   31 , 2011 compared to the same period in the prior year . interest and fees on loans decreased 9 Â   percent , driven by a lower yield on cardmember loans . the lower net yield reflects lower revolving levels , in part driven by higher payment rates , and the implementation of elements of the card act . these reductions to yield were partially offset by the benefit of certain repricing initiatives effective during 2009 and 2010 . interest and dividends on investment securities decreased $ 29 Â   million or 25 Â   percent to $ 88 Â   million , primarily reflecting decreased investment levels , partially offset by higher investment yields . interest on deposits with banks and others increased $ 7 Â   million or 54 Â   percent to $ 20 Â   million , primarily due to higher average deposit balances versus the prior year . interest expense decreased $ 5 Â   million or 1 Â   percent to $ 593 Â   million for the three months ended march 31 , 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 . interest on deposits increased $ 9 Â   million or 7 percent to $ 137 Â   million , as an increase in balances was partially offset by a lower cost of funds . interest on long-term debt and other decreased 3 Â   percent , reflecting a lower average long-term debt balance , partially offset by a higher effective cost of funds . provisions for lossesprovisions for losses of $ 97 Â   million for the three months ended march Â   31 , 2011 decreased $ 846 million or 90 Â   percent compared to the same period in 2010 . charge card provisions for losses decreased $ 29 Â   million or 13 Â   percent , primarily driven by improved year-over-year credit trends , partially offset by higher receivable levels . cardmember loans provisions for losses decreased $ 808 million to a credit balance of $ 120 Â   million , primarily reflecting lower write-offs , improved delinquency and roll rates and a lower cardmember reserve requirement at the end of the first quarter of 2011 due to improving credit performance and a stronger credit profile . other provisions for losses decreased $ 9 Â   million or 32 Â   percent . expensesconsolidated expenses for the three months ended march Â   31 , 2011 were $ 5 . 2 Â   billion , up $ 837 Â   million or 19 Â   percent from $ 4 . 4 Â   billion in 2010 . the increase reflects increased cardmember rewards expenses , higher salaries and employee benefits expenses , greater professional services expenses , higher marketing and promotional expenses , higher other , net expenses , higher occupancy and equipment expenses , and higher cardmember services expenses . marketing and promotion expenses increased $ 90 Â   million or 15 Â   percent to $ 709 Â   million for the three months ended march Â   31 , 2011 from $ 619 Â   million in 2010 , reflecting increased investment spending resulting from continued strong credit and business trends during the first quarter of 2011 . table of contents cardmember rewards expenses increased $ 366 Â   million or 30 Â   percent to $ 1 . 6 Â   billion in 2011 from $ 1 . 2 billion in 2010 , reflecting higher rewards-related spending volumes and co-brand expense . in addition , the company increased its u . s . membership rewards program ultimate redemption rate estimate for current program participants to reflect an increase in redemption patterns based on greater customer engagement . this increase caused the global ultimate redemption rate to increase from approximately 91 Â   percent as of december Â   31 , 2010 to approximately 92 Â   percent as of march Â   31 , 2011 , which resulted in additional rewards expense in the first quarter of 2011 of approximately $ 188 Â   million . refer to Â “ critical accounting policies Â ” in the company Â ’ s 2010 annual report to shareholders for further discussion of its accounting policy for reserves for membership rewards costs . salaries and employee benefits expenses increased $ 195 Â   million or 15 Â   percent to $ 1 . 5 Â   billion for the three months ended march Â   31 , 2011 from $ 1 . 3 Â   billion in 2010 , reflecting higher employee levels , merit increases for existing employees , higher benefit-related costs and higher incentive related compensation . professional services expenses for the three months ended march Â   31 , 2011 increased $ 102 Â   million or 18 Â   percent compared to the same period in 2010 , reflecting higher technology development expenditures including various initiatives related to digitizing the business , globalizing operating platforms , and enhancing analytical and data capabilities ; higher legal costs ; and greater third-party merchant sales-force commissions . other , net expenses for the three months ended march Â   31 , 2011 increased $ 67 Â   million to $ 78 Â   million compared to the same period in 2010 , primarily reflecting a charge in the first quarter of 2011 related to accounting for hedging the company Â ’ s fixed-rate debt compared to a benefit in the first quarter of 2010 , higher taxes other than income and higher travel and entertainment costs . income taxesthe effective tax rate was 32 Â   percent for the three months ended march Â   31 , 2011 compared to 29 percent for the same period in 2010 . the tax rates in both periods reflect the level of pretax income in relation to recurring permanent tax benefits . table of contents consolidated capital resources and liquiditythe company Â ’ s balance sheet management objectives are to maintain : Â • Â   a solid and flexible equity capital profile ; Â   Â • Â   a broad , deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance its assets and meet operating requirements ; and Â   Â • Â   liquidity programs that enable the company to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements , even in the event it is unable to raise new funds under its regular funding programs . capital strategythe company Â ’ s objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through earnings and other sources to maintain a solid equity capital base and to provide flexibility to satisfy future business growth . the company believes capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk-adjusted equity in excess of its costs will generate shareholder value . the level and composition of the company Â ’ s consolidated capital position are determined through the company Â ’ s internal capital adequacy assessment process ( icaap ) , which reflects its business activities , as well as marketplace conditions and credit rating agency requirements . they are also influenced by subsidiary capital requirements . the company , as a bank holding company , is also subject to regulatory requirements administered by the u . s . federal banking agencies . the federal reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets , liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items . the company currently calculates and reports its capital ratios under the measurement standards commonly referred to as basel i . in june Â   2004 , the basel committee on banking supervision ( commonly referred to as basel ) published new international guidelines for determining regulatory capital ( basel ii ) . in december Â   2007 , the u . s . bank regulatory agencies jointly adopted a final rule based on basel ii . the company is not yet subject to the reporting requirements of basel ii , but is taking preparatory steps in contemplation of its adoption . the dodd-frank reform act and a series of international capital and liquidity standards known as basel iii published by basel on december Â   16 , 2010 will in the future change these current quantitative measures . in general , these changes will involve , for the u . s . banking industry as a whole , a reduction in the types of instruments deemed to be capital along with an increase in the amount of capital that assets , liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items require . these changes will generally serve to reduce reported capital ratios compared to current capital guidelines . the specific u . s . guidelines supporting the new standards and the basel iii capital standards have not been finalized , but are generally expected to be issued before this year-end . in addition to these measurement changes , international and u . s . banking regulators could increase the ratio levels at which banks would be deemed to be Â “ well capitalized Â ” . table of contents the following table presents the regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio for the company and its significant bank subsidiaries , as well as additional ratios widely utilized in the marketplace , as of the first quarter of 2011 : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â

will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital , with a greater emphasis on common equity . while final implementation of the rules related to capital ratios will be determined by the federal reserve , the company estimates that had the new rules been in place during the first quarter of 2011 , the reported tier 1 risk-based capital and tier 1 common risk-based ratios would decline by approximately 80 basis points . in addition , the impact of the new rules on the reported tier 1 leverage ratio would be a decline of approximately 170 basis points . the estimated impact of the basel iii rules will change over time based upon changes in the size and composition of the company Â ’ s balance sheet as well as based on the u . s . implementation of the basel iii rules . the following provides definitions for the company Â ’ s regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio , all of which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance : risk-weighted assets tier 1 risk-based capital ratio table of contents total risk-based capital ratio tier 1 leverage ratio the following provides definitions for capital ratios widely used in the marketplace , although they may be calculated differently by different companies : tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio Â — common equity and tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets ratios the company seeks to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements ; failure to maintain minimum capital levels could affect the company Â ’ s status as a financial holding company and cause the respective regulatory agencies to take actions that could limit the company Â ’ s business operations . the company Â ’ s primary source of equity capital has been through the generation of net income . historically , capital generated through net income and other sources , such as the exercise of stock options by employees , has exceeded the growth in its capital requirements . to the extent capital has exceeded business , regulatory and rating agency requirements , the company has returned excess capital to shareholders through its regular common share dividend and share repurchase program . the company maintains certain flexibility to shift capital across its businesses as appropriate . for example , the company may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements . these infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels for american express Â ’ parent company ( parent company ) . share repurchases and dividendsduring the three months ended march Â   31 , 2011 , the company returned $ 217 Â   million in dividends to shareholders , which represents approximately 16 Â   percent of total capital generated . table of contents on a cumulative basis , since 1994 , the company has distributed 63 Â   percent of capital generated through share repurchases and dividends . the company did not repurchase shares through the repurchase program during the first quarter of 2011 . on january Â   7 , 2011 , the company submitted its comprehensive capital plan ( ccp ) Â   to the federal reserve requesting approval to proceed with additional share repurchases in 2011 . the ccp included an analysis of performance and capital availability under certain adverse economic assumptions , as well as a capital distribution plan outlining the company Â ’ s plans to return capital to shareholders in 2011 through dividends and share repurchases . on march Â   18 , 2011 , the company was informed that the federal reserve had no objections to the company Â ’ s 2011 capital distribution plan . the number of shares that will be repurchased in 2011 will be based on the company Â ’ s business plans and financial performance , and will be consistent with its submitted capital distribution plan . the company commenced share repurchase activities during the second quarter of 2011 . as discussed above , the objective is to return to shareholders , on average and over time , approximately 50 Â   percent of the capital it generates through a combination of dividends and the repurchase of common shares . funding strategythe company Â ’ s proprietary card businesses are the primary asset-generating businesses , with significant assets in both domestic and international cardmember receivable and lending activities . the company Â ’ s financing needs are in large part a consequence of its proprietary card-issuing businesses and the maintenance of a liquidity position to support all of its business activities , such as merchant payments . the company generally pays merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by cardmembers and therefore funds the merchant payments during the period cardmember loans and receivables are outstanding . the company also has additional financing needs associated with general corporate purposes , including acquisition activities . the company seeks to raise funds to meet all of its financing needs , including seasonal and other working capital needs , while also seeking to maintain sufficient cash and readily-marketable securities that are easily convertible to cash , in order to meet the scheduled maturities of all long-term borrowings on a consolidated basis for a 12-month period . the company Â ’ s equity capital and funding strategies are designed , among other things , to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies , moody Â ’ s investor services ( moody Â ’ s ) , standard & poor Â ’ s ( s & p ) , fitch ratings ( fitch ) and dominion bond rating services ( dbrs ) . such ratings help to support the company Â ’ s access to cost effective unsecured funding as part of its overall financing programs . ratings for the company Â ’ s asset-backed securitization ( abs ) Â   activities are evaluated separately . table of contents unsecured debt ratings Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   short-term Â   long-term Â   Â

Â   downgrades in the company Â ’ s unsecured debt or asset securitization program Â ’ s securities ratings could result in higher interest expense on the company Â ’ s unsecured debt and asset securitizations , as well as higher fees related to borrowings under its unused lines of credit . in addition to increased funding costs , declines in credit ratings could reduce the company Â ’ s borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets . the company believes the change in its funding mix , which now includes an increasing proportion of fdic-insured ( as defined below ) u . s . retail deposits , should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on the company Â ’ s funding capacity and costs . however , downgrades to certain of the company Â ’ s unsecured debt ratings that have occurred over the last several years have not caused a permanent increase in the company Â ’ s borrowing costs or a reduction in its borrowing capacity . deposit programsduring the first quarter of 2011 , within u . s . retail deposits the company focused on continuing to grow both the number of accounts and the total balances outstanding on savings accounts and cds that were sourced directly with consumers through personal savings from american express . the account and balance growth of personal savings from american express financed the maturities of cds issued through third-party distribution channels . the company held the following deposits as of : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   march 31 , Â   Â   december 31 , ( billions ) Â   2011 Â   Â   2010u . s . retail deposits : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   savings accounts Â — direct Â   $ 11 . 7 Â   Â   $ 7 . 7certificates of deposit : ( a ) Â   Â

total portfolio of u . s . retail cds , issued through direct and third-party programs , were 19 . 5 Â   months and 2 . 6 Â   percent , respectively . table of contents asset securitization programsthe receivables and loans being securitized are reported as owned assets on the company Â ’ s consolidated balance sheets and the related securities issued to third-party investors are reported as long-term debt . under the respective terms of the securitization trust agreements , the occurrence of certain triggering events could result in payment of trust expenses , establishment of reserve funds , or in a worst-case scenario , early amortization of investor certificates . no triggering events have occurred in the three months ended march Â   31 , 2011 that would have resulted in the funding of reserve accounts or early amortization . the ability of issuers of asset-backed securities to obtain necessary credit ratings for their issuances has historically been based , in part , on qualification under the fdic Â ’ s safe harbor rule for assets transferred in securitizations . in 2009 and 2010 , the fdic issued a series of changes to its safe harbor rule , with its new final rule for its securitization safe harbor , issued in 2010 , requiring issuers to comply with a new set of requirements in order to qualify for the safe harbor . issuances out of the american express credit account master trust ( the lending trust ) are grandfathered under the new fdic final rule . the trust for the company Â ’ s cardmember charge receivable securitization ( the charge trust ) does not satisfy the criteria required to be covered by the fdic Â ’ s new safe harbor rule , nor did it meet the requirements to be covered by the safe harbor rule existing prior to 2009 . it was structured and continues to be structured such that the financial assets transferred to the charge trust would not be deemed to be property of the originating banks in the event the fdic is appointed as a receiver or conservator of the originating banks . the company has received confirmation from moody Â ’ s , s & p and fitch , which rate issuances from the charge trust , that they will continue to rate issuances from the trust in the same manner as they have historically , even though the charge trust does not satisfy the requirements to be covered by the fdic Â ’ s safe harbor rule . nevertheless , one or more of the rating agencies may ultimately conclude that in the absence of compliance with the safe harbor rule , the highest rating a charge trust security could receive would be based on the originating bank Â ’ s unsecured debt rating . if one or more rating agencies come to this conclusion , it could adversely impact the company Â ’ s capacity and cost of using its charge trust as a source of funding for its business . liquidity managementthe company incurs and accepts liquidity risk arising in the normal course of offering its products and services . the liquidity risks that the company is exposed to can arise from a variety of sources , and thus its liquidity management strategy includes a variety of parameters , assessments and guidelines , including but not limited to : Â • Â   maintaining a diversified set of funding sources ( refer to funding strategy section for more details ) ; Â   Â • Â   maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off-balance sheet liquidity sources ; and Â   Â • Â   projecting cash inflows and outflows from a variety of sources and under a variety of scenarios , including contingent liquidity exposures such as unused cardmember lines of credit and collateral requirements for derivative transactions . table of contents the company Â ’ s current liquidity target is to have adequate liquidity in the form of excess cash and readily-marketable securities that are easily convertible into cash to satisfy all maturing long-term funding obligations for a 12-month period . in addition to its cash and readily-marketable securities , the company maintains a variety of contingent liquidity resources , such as access to secured borrowings through its undrawn amount under the conduit facility and the federal reserve discount window as well as committed bank credit facilities . as of march Â   31 , 2011 , the company Â ’ s excess cash and readily-marketable securities available to fund long-term maturities were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( billions ) Â   total Â   cash Â   $ 22 . 0 Â   readily-marketable securities Â   Â   4 . 1 ( a ) Â   Â   Â   Â   cash and readily-marketable

ended march Â   31 , 2011 , net cash provided by operating activities of $ 0 . 8 billion decreased $ 1 . 5 Â   billion compared to $ 2 . 3 Â   billion in 2010 . the decrease was due to lower provisions for losses , decreases in non-cash adjustments for deferred taxes and other , and changes in other receivables , other assets , and accounts payable and other liabilities , partially offset by higher net income in 2011 . cash flows from investing activitiesfor the three months ended march Â   31 , 2011 , net cash provided by investing activities of $ 8 . 7 billion increased $ 1 . 0 Â   billion compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $ 7 . 7 billion in the first quarter of 2010 , primarily due to lower purchases of investments and fluctuations in restricted cash in 2011 , partially offset by lower maturity and redemption of investments and a lower decrease in cardmember loans and receivables . cash flows from financing activitiesfor the three months ended march Â   31 , 2011 , net cash used in financing activities of $ 3 . 8 Â   billion increased $ 0 . 1 Â   billion compared to $ 3 . 7 Â   billion in the first quarter of 2010 , due to an increase in principal payments of long-term debt and a reduction of the issuance of long-term debt , partially offset by lower net payments of short-term borrowings and increased growth in customer deposits during the first quarter of 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010 . certain legislative , regulatory and other developmentsthe card act table of contents the company has made changes to its product terms and practices that are designed to mitigate the impact on company revenue of the changes required by the card act and the regulatory amendments . these changes include instituting product-specific increases in pricing on purchases and cash advances , modifying the criteria pursuant to which the penalty rate of interest is imposed on a cardmember and assessing late fees on certain charge products at an earlier date than previously assessed . although the company believes its actions to mitigate the impact of the card act have , to date , been largely effective ( as evidenced in part by the net interest yield for its u . s . lending portfolio ) , the impacts of certain other provisions of the card act are still subject to some uncertainty ( such as the requirement to periodically reevaluate apr increases ) . accordingly , in the event the actions undertaken by the company to date to offset the impact of the new legislation and regulations are not ultimately effective , they could have a material adverse effect on the company Â ’ s results of operations , including its revenue and net income . dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection actunder the dodd-frank reform act , the federal reserve is authorized to regulate interchange fees paid to banks on debit card and certain general-use prepaid card transactions to ensure that they are Â “ reasonable and proportional Â ” to the cost of processing individual transactions , and to prohibit debit and general-use prepaid card networks and issuers from requiring transactions to be processed on a single payment network . the company does not issue a debit card linked to a deposit account , but does issue various types of prepaid cards , which could potentially be subject to these provisions of the dodd-frank reform act . while the company does not have an interchange fee as exists on Â “ four-party Â ” networks like visa and mastercard , the applicability of the rules regarding interchange and alternative network routing to certain of the company Â ’ s prepaid products will be clarified in the final provisions to be issued by the federal reserve board in july 2011 . the dodd-frank reform act also prohibits credit / debit networks from restricting a merchant from offering discounts or incentives to customers in order to encourage them to use a particular form of payment , or from restricting a merchant from setting certain minimum and maximum transaction amounts for credit cards , as long as any such discounts or incentives or any minimum or maximum transaction amounts do not discriminate among issuers or networks and comply with applicable federal or state disclosure requirements . the dodd-frank reform act also authorizes the federal reserve to establish heightened capital , leverage and liquidity standards , risk management requirements , concentration limits on credit exposures , mandatory resolution plans ( so-called Â “ living wills Â ” ) and stress tests for , among others , large bank holding companies , such as the company , that have greater than $ 50 Â   billion in assets . in addition , certain derivative transactions will be required to be centrally cleared , which may create or increase collateral posting requirements for the company . table of contents many provisions of the dodd-frank reform act require the adoption of rules for implementation . in addition , the dodd-frank reform act mandates multiple studies , which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action . these new rules and studies will be implemented and undertaken over a period of several years . accordingly , the ultimate consequences of the dodd-frank reform act and its implementing regulations on the company Â ’ s business , results of operations and financial condition are uncertain at this time . other legislative and regulatory initiativesin addition to the provisions of the dodd-frank reform act regarding merchants Â ’ ability to offer discounts or incentives to encourage customers Â ’ use of a particular form of payment , a number of u . s . states are also considering legislation that would prohibit card networks from imposing conditions , restrictions or penalties on a merchant if the merchant , among other things , ( i ) provides a discount to a customer for using one form of payment versus another or one type of credit or charge card versus another , ( ii ) Â   imposes a minimum dollar requirement on customers with respect to the use of credit or charge cards or ( iii ) Â   chooses to accept credit and charge cards at some of its locations but not at others . such legislation has recently been enacted in vermont , and similar legislation has been introduced in other states . also , other countries in which the company operates have been considering and in some cases adopting similar legislation and rules that would impose changes on certain practices of card issuers and bankcard networks . any or all of the above changes to the legal and regulatory environment in which the company operates could have a material adverse effect on the company Â ’ s results of operations . refer to Â “ consolidated capital resources and liquidity Â ” for a discussion of the series of international capital and liquidity standards published by basel . table of contents business segment resultsbeginning in the first quarter of 2011 , the company changed its segment allocation methodology to better align segment reporting with the company Â ’ s previously announced management reorganization , which has been implemented over the last several quarters . the reorganization included the formation of the enterprise growth group , which is reported in the corporate & other segment . starting in the first quarter of 2011 , certain business activities such as loyalty edge and global foreign exchange services that were previously managed and reported in the uscs and gcs operating segments , respectively , are now managed by enterprise growth and reported in the corporate & other segment . the reorganization also included consolidation of certain corporate support functions into the global services organization . greater centralization of activities has led to modifications in the costs being allocated from the corporate & other segment to the reported operating segments starting in the first quarter of 2011 . prior period segment results have been revised for these changes . in addition , beginning the fourth quarter of 2010 , the company completed its conversion to a new general ledger platform . this conversion enabled the company to streamline its ledger reporting unit structure , resulting in a reconfiguration of intercompany accounts . these changes have the effect of altering intercompany balances among segments , thus altering reported total segment assets . total segment assets presented in the first quarter of 2011 reflect the changes described above . this conversion had no impact on segment results , segment capital or return on segment capital metrics . u . s . card services Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   three

of interest expense increased $ 75 Â   million or 2 Â   percent to $ 3 . 6 Â   billion for the three months ended march Â   31 , 2011 , primarily driven by higher discount revenue , net card fees and

million or 9 Â   percent from $ 2 . 3 Â   billion , primarily due to higher discount revenue resulting from billed business growth of 13 Â   percent , partially offset by lower other commissions and

< date > 2010-09-30 < / date > < price > 42 . 03 < / price > < company > axp < / company > american express is a global service company that provides customers with access to products , insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success . the company Â ’ s principal products and services are charge and credit payment card products and travel-related services offered to consumers and businesses around the world . the company Â ’ s range of products and services include : Â • Â   charge and credit card products ; Â   Â • Â   expense management products and services ; Â   Â • Â   consumer and business travel services ; Â   Â • Â   stored value products such as travelers cheques and other prepaid products ; Â   Â • Â   network services for the company Â ’ s network partners ; Â   Â • Â   merchant acquisition and processing , point-of-sale , servicing and settlement and marketing products and services for merchants ; and Â   Â • Â   fee services , including market and trend analyses and related consulting services , and the design of customized customer loyalty and rewards programs . the company Â ’ s products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups , including consumers , small businesses , middle-market companies , and large corporations . these products and services are sold through various channels , including direct mail , on-line applications , targeted direct and third-party sales forces , and direct response advertising . the company Â ’ s products and services generate the following types of revenue for the company : Â • Â   discount revenue , which is the company Â ’ s largest revenue source , represents fees charged to merchants when cardmembers use their cards to purchase goods and services on the company Â ’ s network ; Â   Â • Â   net card fees , which represent revenue earned for annual charge card memberships ; Â   Â • Â   travel commissions and fees , which are earned by charging a transaction or management fee for airline or other travel-related transactions ; Â   Â • Â   other commissions and fees , which are earned on foreign exchange conversions and card-related fees and assessments ; Â   Â • Â   other revenue , which represents insurance premiums earned from cardmember travel and other insurance programs , revenues arising from contracts with global network services Â ’ ( gns ) partners ( including royalties and signing fees ) , publishing revenues and other miscellaneous revenue and fees ; and Â   Â • Â   interest and fees on loans , which principally represents interest income earned on outstanding balances , and card fees related to the cardmember loans portfolio . in addition to funding and operating costs associated with these types of revenue , other major expense categories are related to marketing and reward programs that add new cardmembers and promote cardmember loyalty and spending , and provisions for anticipated cardmember credit and fraud losses . as previously disclosed , the company has created an enterprise growth group to focus on generating alternative sources of revenue . under its new group president , the enterprise growth group has recently been organized into four units : an online and mobile payments unit ; a global payments business focusing on developing payment forms outside the company Â ’ s traditional charge and credit card products ; a unit focusing on emerging payments in india , china and certain other asian countries ; and a fee-based services unit . the enterprise growth group will seek to expand revenues both through organic growth that leverages existing assets and through increased acquisition activity . table of contents historically , the company has sought to achieve three financial targets , on average and over time : Â   Â • Â   revenues net of interest expense growth of at least 8 Â   percent ; Â   Â   Â • Â   earnings per share ( eps ) Â   growth of 12 to 15 Â   percent ; and Â   Â   Â • Â   return on average equity ( roe ) Â   of 33 to 36 Â   percent . in addition , assuming achievement of such financial targets , the company has sought to return at least 65 Â   percent of the capital it generates to shareholders as a dividend or through the repurchase of common stock . the company met or exceeded these targets for most of the past decade . however , during 2008 and 2009 , its performance fell short of the targets due to the effects of the continuing global economic downturn . the company Â ’ s share repurchase program was suspended in 2008 and , as a result , the amount of capital generated that is returned to shareholders has been below the levels achieved earlier in the decade . the company is retaining its on average and over time revenue and earnings growth targets . however , evolving market , regulatory and debt investor expectations will likely cause the company , as well as other financial institutions , to maintain in future years a higher level of capital than they have historically maintained . these higher capital requirements would in turn lead , all other things being equal , to lower future roe than the company has historically targeted . in addition , the company recognizes it may need to maintain higher capital levels to support acquisitions that can augment its business growth . in combination , these factors have led the company to revise its on average and over time roe financial target to 25 Â   percent or more . in establishing the revised roe target , the company has assumed that it will seek to maintain a 10 percent tier 1 common ratio , although the actual future capital requirements applicable to the company are uncertain and will not be known until further guidance is provided in connection with certain initiatives , such as basel iii and the implementation of regulations under the recent united states financial reform legislation . international and united states banking regulators could also increase the capital ratio levels at which banks would be deemed to be Â “ well capitalized Â ” . refer to capital strategy below . the revised roe target also assumes the company would need to maintain capital to finance moderate-sized acquisitions , although the actual magnitude of these transactions cannot be determined at this time . if the company achieves its eps target as well as the revised roe target , it would seek to return , on average and over time , at least 50 Â   percent of the capital it generates to shareholders as a dividend or through the repurchase of common stock rather than the 65 Â   percent level referred to above . certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the current presentation . certain of the statements in this form 10-q report are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 . refer to the Â “ forward-looking statements Â ” section below . bank holding company the company is a bank holding company under the bank holding company act of 1956 and the federal reserve board ( federal reserve ) is the company Â ’ s primary federal regulator . as such , the company is subject to the federal reserve Â ’ s regulations , policies and minimum capital standards . current economic environment / outlookthe company Â ’ s results for the third quarter of 2010 continued to reflect an improved economic environment . year-over-year cardmember spending volumes grew both in the united states and internationally , and across all of the company Â ’ s businesses . spending growth as compared to last year table of contents continued into the fourth quarter of 2010 through october at levels similar to those in the third quarter despite the more difficult year-over-year comparison in october . the company continues to see a sharp divergence between the positive growth rates in customer spending on credit cards and lower borrowing levels , due in part to changing consumer behavior and the company Â ’ s strategic ( i . e . additional focus on charge and co-brand products ) and risk-related actions . while the offsetting influences of stronger billings growth and lower loan balances challenge overall revenue growth , improving credit trends have provided an ability to invest in the business at significant levels and also generate strong earnings . some of these investments are focused on near-term metrics , while others are allocated toward initiatives focused on the medium to long-term success of the company . these investments are reflected not only in marketing , promotion and rewards expenses but also in other operating expenses , mainly salaries and benefits , professional services and other , net expenses . the improving credit trends contributed to the reduction in the third quarter of approximately $ 620 million in loss reserves , although reserve coverage ratios remain strong . it is expected that the year-over-year benefits from improving credit trends will decrease over the course of the year . while the company is currently investing at historically high levels , the challenges described below have the company approaching future investment and expense commitments with caution . net interest yield for the third quarter decreased year-over-year . the lower yield reflects higher payment rates and lower revolving levels , and the implementation of elements of the recently passed credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 ( the Â “ card act Â ” ) , which were partially offset by the benefit of certain repricing initiatives effective during 2009 and 2010 . the company expects to attain a net interest yield in the us consumer business closer to historic levels of approximately 9 Â   percent1despite the improved economic environment , challenges clearly remain for the company , both in the united states and in many other key markets . these challenges include weak job creation , volatile consumer confidence , uncertain consumer behavior , and the regulatory and legislative environment , including the uncertain impact of the card act , of the recently enacted dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and of the proceeding against the company recently brought by the department of justice ( doj ) Â   and certain state attorneys general alleging a violation of the u . s . antitrust laws . refer to Â “ certain legislative , regulatory and other developments Â ” , Â “ other information Â — legal proceedings Â ” and Â “ risk factors Â ” below . reengineering initiativesin the fourth quarter of 2008 and the second quarter of 2009 the company undertook major reengineering initiatives that together were expected to produce cost benefits of approximately $ 2 . 6 Â   billion in 2009 versus the previously anticipated spending levels . these initiatives included reducing staffing levels and compensation expenses ( expected benefit of $ 875 Â   million in 2009 ) , reducing certain operating costs ( expected benefit of $ 250 Â   million in 2009 ) and scaling back investment spending ( expected benefit of $ 1 . 5 Â   billion in 2009 ) . the company recorded restructuring charges of $ 404 Â   million ( $ 262 Â   million after-tax ) in the fourth quarter of 2008 and $ 182 Â   million ( $ 118 Â   million after-tax ) in the second quarter of 2009 , respectively , primarily associated with severance and other costs related to the expected elimination of a significant number of positions . as the company has previously indicated , beginning in the third quarter of 2009 , benefits related to better than initially forecasted credit and business trends for 2009 , which have continued into 2010 , were utilized to increase spending on marketing and other business-building initiatives during the second half of the year . Â   1 Â   as discussed on page 41 below , net interest yield is a non-gaap measure . the comparable gaap measure is not determinable at this time . table of contents this has reduced the expected carryover into 2010 of the reengineering benefits previously discussed in 2009 related to investment spending and position eliminations . in the third quarter of 2010 , income from continuing operations reflects $ 2 Â   million ( $ 1 Â   million after-tax ) of net reengineering cost . discontinued operations for the three and nine months ended september Â   30 , 2009 , the operating results , assets and liabilities , and cash flows of american express international deposit company ( aeidc ) , which was sold to standard chartered in the third quarter of 2009 , have been removed from the corporate & other segment and reported separately within the discontinued operations captions on the company Â ’ s consolidated financial statements . table of contents american express company Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   three months ended Â   Â   nine months ended Â   Â   Â   september 30 , Â   Â   september 30 , Â   ( billions , except percentages and where indicated ) Â   2010 Â   Â   2009 Â   Â   2010 Â   Â   2009 Â   card billed business : ( a ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   united states Â   $ 120 . 5 Â   Â   $ 106 . 5 Â   Â   $ 348 . 2 Â   Â   $ 308 . 7 Â   outside the united states Â   Â   58 . 8 Â   Â   Â   50 . 1 Â   Â   Â   167 . 4 Â   Â   Â   138 . 5 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   total Â   $ 179 . 3 Â   Â   $ 156 . 6 Â   Â   $ 515 . 6 Â   Â   $ 447 . 2 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   total cards-in-force ( millions ) ( b ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   united states Â   $ 48 . 1 Â   Â   $ 49 . 4 Â   Â   $ 48 . 1 Â   Â   $ 49 . 4 Â   outside the united states Â   Â   40 . 9 Â   Â   Â   39 . 0 Â   Â   Â   40 . 9 Â   Â   Â   39 . 0 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   total Â   $ 89 . 0 Â   Â   $ 88 . 4 Â   Â   $ 89 . 0 Â   Â   $ 88 . 4 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   basic cards-in-force ( millions ) ( b ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   united states Â   $ 37 . 2 Â   Â   $ 38 . 6 Â   Â   $ 37 . 2 Â   Â   $ 38 . 6 Â   outside the united states Â   Â   36 . 2 Â   Â   Â   34 . 3 Â   Â   Â   36 . 2 Â   Â   Â   34 . 3 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   total Â   $ 73 . 4 Â   Â   $ 72 . 9 Â   Â   $ 73 . 4 Â   Â   $ 72 . 9 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   average discount rate ( c ) Â   Â   2 . 56 % Â   Â   2 . 54 % Â   Â   2 . 56 % Â   Â   2 . 55 % average basic cardmember spending ( dollars ) ( d ) Â   $ 3 , 330 Â   Â   $ 2 , 898 Â   Â   $ 9 , 628 Â   Â   $ 8 , 029 Â   average fee per card ( dollars ) ( d ) Â   $ 38 Â   Â   $ 37 Â   Â   $ 37 Â   Â   $ 37 Â   average fee per card adjusted ( dollars ) ( d ) Â   $ 41 Â   Â   $ 41 Â   Â   $ 41 Â   Â   $ 41 Â   Â   Â   ( a ) Â   card billed business includes activities ( including cash advances ) related to proprietary cards , cards issued under network partnership agreements ( non-proprietary billed business ) , and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards . in-store spend activity within retail co-brand portfolios in global network services , from which the company earns no revenue , is not included in non-proprietary billed business . card billed business is reflected in the united states or outside the united states based on where the cardmember is domiciled . Â   ( b ) Â   total cards-in-force represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding . proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner and does not include additional supplemental cards issued on that account . proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force include basic and supplemental cards issued to employee cardmembers . non-proprietary cards-in-force includes all cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements , except for retail co-brand cardmember accounts that have no out-of-store spend activity during the prior 12-month period . Â   ( c ) Â   this calculation is designed to reflect pricing at merchants accepting general purpose american express cards . it represents the percentage of billed business ( both proprietary and global network services ) retained by the company from merchants it acquires , prior to payments to third parties unrelated to merchant acceptance . Â   ( d ) Â   average basic cardmember spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only . average fee per card is computed based on net card fees , including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs , plus card fees included in interest and fees on loans ( including related amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs ) , divided by average worldwide proprietary cards-in-force . the card fees related to cardmember loans included in interest and fees on loans were $ 58 Â   million and $ 47 Â   million for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively , and $ 157 Â   million and $ 132 Â   million for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively . the adjusted average fee per card is computed in the same manner , but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs ( a portion of which is charge card related and included in net card fees and a portion of which is lending related and included in interest and fees on loans ) . the amount of amortization excluded was $ 49 Â   million and $ 57 Â   million for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively , and $ 156 Â   million and $ 189 Â   million for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively . the company presents adjusted average fee per card because management believes this metric presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of its proprietary card products . table of contents american express company Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â

Â   ( b ) Â   effective january Â   1 , 2010 , the company revised the time period in which past due cardmember receivables in international card services and global commercial services are written off to when they are 180 Â   days past due or earlier , consistent with applicable bank regulatory guidance and the write-off methodology adopted for u . s . card services in the fourth quarter of 2008 . previously , receivables were written off when they were 360 Â   days past billing or earlier . therefore , the net write-offs for the first quarter of 2010 included net write-offs of approximately $ 60 Â   million for international card services and approximately $ 48 Â   million for global commercial services resulting from this write-off methodology change , which increased the net loss ratios and decreased the 90 Â   days past billing metrics for these segments , but did not have a substantial impact on provisions for losses . table of contents ( c ) Â   beginning with the first quarter of 2010 , the company has revised the net loss ratio to exclude net write-offs related to unauthorized transactions , consistent with the methodology for calculation of the net write-off rate for u . s . card services . the metrics for prior periods have not been revised for this change as it was deemed immaterial . Â   ( d ) Â   for periods ended on or prior to december Â   31 , 2009 , the company Â ’ s cardmember loans and related debt performance information on a gaap basis was referred to as the Â “ owned Â ” basis presentation . the information presented on a gaap basis for such periods includes only non-securitized cardmember loans that were included in the company Â ’ s balance sheet . effective january Â   1 , 2010 , the company Â ’ s securitized portfolio of cardmember loans and related debt is also consolidated on its balance sheet upon the adoption of the new gaap . accordingly , beginning january Â   1 , 2010 , the gaap basis presentation includes both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans . refer to page 66 for a discussion of gaap basis information .

Â   ( f ) Â   see below for calculations of net interest yield on cardmember loans , a non-gaap measure , and net interest income divided by average loans , a gaap measure . management believes net interest yield on cardmember loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of the company Â ’ s cardmember loan portfolio . Â   ( g ) Â   this calculation includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the cardmember loan portfolio , and thus is not representative of net interest yield on cardmember loans . the calculation includes interest income and interest expense attributable to investment securities and other interest-bearing deposits as well as to cardmember loans , and interest expense attributable to other activities , including cardmember receivables .

Â   ( b ) Â   for periods ended on or prior to december Â   31 , 2009 , the company Â ’ s cardmember loans and related debt performance information on a gaap basis was referred to as the Â “ owned Â ” basis presentation . the information presented on a gaap basis for such periods includes only non-securitized cardmember loans that were included in the company Â ’ s balance sheet . effective january Â   1 , 2010 , the company Â ’ s securitized portfolio of cardmember loans and related debt is also consolidated on its balance sheet upon the adoption of the new gaap . accordingly , beginning january Â   1 , 2010 , the gaap basis presentation includes both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans . refer to page 66 for a discussion of gaap basis information . Â   ( c ) Â   represents net interest income allocated to the company Â ’ s cardmember loans portfolio on a gaap or managed basis , as applicable , in each case excluding the impact of card fees on loans and balance transfer fees attributable to the company Â ’ s cardmember loans . Â   ( d ) Â   represents average cardmember loans on a gaap or managed basis , as applicable , in each case excluding the impact of deferred card fees , net of deferred direct acquisition costs of cardmember loans . Â   ( e ) Â   this calculation includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the cardmember loan portfolio , and thus is not representative of net interest yield on cardmember loans . the calculation includes interest income and interest expense attributable to investment securities and other interest-bearing deposits as well as to cardmember loans , and interest expense attributable to other activities , including cardmember receivables . Â   ( f ) Â   net interest yield on cardmember loans is a non-gaap financial measure that represents the net spread earned on cardmember loans . net interest yield on cardmember loans is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by adjusted average loans , computed on an annualized basis . the calculation of net interest yield on cardmember loans includes interest that is deemed uncollectible . for all presentations of net interest yield on cardmember loans , reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses Â — cardmember loans ; therefore , such reserves and net write-offs are not included in the net interest yield calculation . Â   ( g ) Â   for periods ended on or prior to december Â   31 , 2009 , information presented is based on the company Â ’ s historical non-gaap , or Â “ managed Â ” basis presentation . unlike the gaap basis presentation , the information presented on a managed basis in such periods includes both the securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans . the adoption of new gaap on january Â   1 , 2010 resulted in accounting for both the company Â ’ s securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans in the consolidated financial statements . as a result , the company Â ’ s 2010 gaap presentations and managed basis presentations prior to 2010 are generally comparable . refer to page 66 for a discussion of managed basis information . Â   ( h ) Â   for periods ended on or prior to december Â   31 , 2009 , the information presented includes the adjustments to the gaap Â “ owned Â ” basis presentation for such periods attributable to securitization activity for interest income and interest expense to arrive at the non-gaap Â “ managed Â ” basis information , which adjustments are set forth under the u . s . card services managed basis presentation on page 67 . table of contents the following discussions regarding consolidated results of operations and consolidated liquidity and capital resources are presented on a basis consistent with gaap unless otherwise noted . consolidated results of operations for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2010 and 2009the company Â ’ s consolidated net income for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2010 increased $ 453 Â   million or 71 Â   percent from the same period a year ago to $ 1 . 1 Â   billion , and diluted eps increased $ 0 . 37 or 70 Â   percent to $ 0 . 90 . on a trailing 12-month basis , roe was 25 . 9 Â   percent , up from 11 . 7 Â   percent a year ago . the company Â ’ s total revenues net of interest expense and total expenses increased by approximately 17 Â   percent and 28 Â   percent , respectively , and provisions for losses decreased by approximately 68 percent for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2010 . assuming no changes in foreign currency exchange rates , total revenues net of interest expense and total expenses increased by approximately 17 Â   percent and 28 Â   percent , respectively , and provisions for losses decreased by approximately 68 Â   percent for the three months ended september Â   30 , 20102total revenues net of interest expenseconsolidated total revenues net of interest expense were $ 7 . 0 Â   billion for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2010 , up $ 1 . 0 Â   billion or 17 Â   percent from $ 6 . 0 Â   billion in the same period a year ago . the increase in total revenues net of interest expense partially reflects the new gaap effective january Â   1 , 2010 , which caused the reporting of write-offs related to securitized loans to move from securitization income , net in the third quarter of 2009 to provisions for cardmember loan losses in the third quarter of 2010 . in addition , total revenues net of interest expense reflects higher discount revenues , greater travel commissions and fees , increased other commissions and fees and higher other revenues , partially offset by lower net interest income on the combined securitized and non-securitized loan portfolio , and lower net card fees . discount revenue increased $ 445 Â   million or 13 Â   percent to $ 3 . 8 Â   billion as a result of a 14 Â   percent increase in billed business . the lesser revenue versus billed business growth reflects the relatively faster growth in billed business related to global network services ( gns ) , where discount revenue is shared with card issuing partners , and higher contra-revenues , including cash-back rewards costs and corporate incentive payments . the average discount rate was 2 . 56 percent and 2 . 54 Â   percent for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively . as indicated in prior quarters , certain pricing initiatives , changes in the mix of business and volume-related pricing discounts and investments will likely result in some erosion of the average discount rate over time . united states billed business and billed business outside the united states were up 13 Â   percent and 17 Â   percent , respectively , primarily due to increases in average spending per proprietary basic card . billed business outside the united states was up 16 Â   percent assuming no changes in foreign currency exchange rates . Â   2 Â   these currency rate adjustments assume a constant exchange rate between periods for purposes of currency translation into u . s . dollars ( i . e . , assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current year apply to the corresponding year-earlier period against which such results are being compared ) . management believes this presentation is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare the company Â ’ s performance from one period to another without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates . table of contents the table below summarizes selected statistics for increases and decreases during the three months ended september Â   30 , 2010 compared to the same period in prior year : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   percentage increase Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   assuming no Â   Â   Â   percentage Â   Â   changes in foreign Â   Â   Â   increase / ( decrease ) Â   Â   exchange rates Â   worldwide : ( a ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   billed business Â   Â   14 % Â   Â   14 % proprietary billed business Â   Â   13 Â   Â   Â   13 Â   gns billed business ( b ) Â   Â   24 Â   Â   Â   22 Â   average spending per proprietary basic card Â   Â   15 Â   Â   Â   15 Â   basic cards-in-force Â   Â   1 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   united states : ( a ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   billed business Â   Â   13 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   average spending per proprietary basic card Â   Â   14 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   basic cards-in-force Â   Â   ( 4 ) Â   Â   Â   Â   proprietary consumer card billed business ( c ) Â   Â   12 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   proprietary small business billed business ( c ) Â   Â   12 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   proprietary corporate services billed business ( d ) Â   Â   18 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   outside the united states : ( a ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   billed business Â   Â   17 Â   Â   Â   16 Â   average spending per proprietary basic card Â   Â   17 Â   Â   Â   16 Â   basic cards-in-force Â   Â   6 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   proprietary consumer and small business billed business ( e ) Â   Â   12 Â   Â   Â   10 Â   proprietary corporate services billed business ( d ) Â   Â   19 Â   Â   Â   20 Â   Â   Â   ( a ) Â   captions in the table above not designated as Â “ proprietary Â ” include both proprietary and global network services data .

Â   ( d ) Â   included in the global commercial services segment . Â   ( e ) Â   included in the international card services segment . assuming no changes in foreign exchange rates , total billed business outside the united states increased 23 Â   percent in asia pacific , 17 Â   percent in latin america , 12 Â   percent in canada , and 11 percent in europe . total cards-in-force increased 1 Â   percent worldwide as a 3 Â   percent increase in gns was partially offset by decreases of 1 Â   percent in international card services ( ics ) Â   and global commercial services ( gcs ) , while cards-in-force was flat in united states card services ( uscs ) . during the third quarter of 2010 , the definition of non-proprietary cards-in-force was changed to exclude retail co-brand cardmember accounts in gns that have no out-of-store spend activity during the prior 12-month period . this change caused a reduction to reported cards-in-force of 1 . 6 Â   million . also , during the third quarter of 2010 , total cards-in-force decreased by 900 , 000 in the united states due to the change described above and increased by 1 Â   million outside the united states . travel commissions and fees increased $ 104 Â   million or 27 Â   percent to $ 487 Â   million , reflecting a 21 percent increase in worldwide travel sales , as well as a higher sales revenue rate . other commissions and fees increased $ 67 Â   million or 15 Â   percent to $ 515 Â   million , driven primarily by the new gaap effective january Â   1 , 2010 where fees related to securitized receivables are now recognized as other commissions and fees starting in the first quarter of 2010 . these fees were previously reported in securitization income , net . the increase also reflects greater foreign currency conversion revenues related table of contents to higher spending , partially offset by lower delinquency fees in the non-securitized cardmember loan portfolio . other revenues increased $ 53 Â   million or 12 Â   percent to $ 502 Â   million , primarily reflecting higher gns partner-related revenue and higher publishing revenue , partially offset by lower insurance premium revenue . interest income increased $ 497 Â   million or 38 Â   percent to $ 1 . 8 Â   billion in 2010 . interest and fees on loans increased $ 616 Â   million or 58 Â   percent to $ 1 . 7 Â   billion , driven by an increase in the average loan balance resulting from the consolidation of securitized receivables in accordance with the new gaap effective january Â   1 , 2010 . interest income related to securitized receivables was reported in securitization income , net in prior periods , but is now reported in interest and fees on loans . the increase related to the consolidation was partially offset by a lower yield on cardmember loans , reflecting higher payment rates and lower revolving levels , and the implementation of elements of the card act , which were partially offset by the benefit of certain repricing initiatives effective during 2009 and 2010 . worldwide cardmember loan balances of $ 57 . 2 Â   billion as of september Â   30 , 2010 increased 74 . 4 Â   percent from $ 32 . 8 Â   billion as of december Â   31 , 2009 , due to the adoption of the new gaap effective january Â   1 , 2010 . on a comparable managed basis , including securitized loans in both periods , cardmember loan balances of $ 57 . 2 Â   billion declined 7 . 4 Â   percent from $ 61 . 8 Â   billion as of december Â   31 , 2009 , reflecting higher cardmember payment rates and the growth of products with lower revolving balances , partially offset by higher cardmember spending levels during the first half of 2010 . for further discussion of the managed basis presentation , refer to the Â “ cardmember loan portfolio presentation Â ” below . interest and dividends on investment securities decreased $ 126 Â   million or 55 Â   percent to $ 103 million , primarily reflecting the elimination of interest on retained securities driven by the new gaap effective january Â   1 , 2010 and decreased short-term investment levels . interest on deposits with banks and others increased $ 7 Â   million or 78 Â   percent to $ 16 Â   million , primarily due to higher average deposit balances versus the prior year , partially offset by lower interest yields . interest expense increased $ 67 Â   million or 12 Â   percent to $ 610 Â   million in 2010 . interest on deposits increased $ 32 Â   million or 29 Â   percent to $ 141 Â   million , as an increase in balances was partially offset by a lower cost of funds . interest on short-term borrowings decreased $ 2 Â   million to nil , reflecting low short-term debt levels similar to the prior year and a lower cost of funds . interest on long-term debt and other increased $ 37 Â   million or 9 Â   percent to $ 469 Â   million , reflecting the consolidation of long-term debt associated with securitized loans previously held off-balance sheet in accordance with the new gaap effective january Â   1 , 2010 . interest expense related to this debt was reported in securitization income , net in prior periods , but is now reported in long-term debt and other interest expense . excluding this impact , long-term debt and other interest expense would have declined due to lower average debt outstanding unrelated to securitized loans . provisions for lossesconsolidated provisions for losses decreased $ 805 Â   million or 68 Â   percent to $ 373 Â   million compared to the prior year . provisions for losses declined despite the new gaap effective january Â   1 , 2010 , which caused write-offs related to securitized loans to be reported in the provisions for losses line in the third quarter of 2010 as opposed to securitization income , net in the third quarter of 2009 . the provision decrease reflects the benefit of improving year-over-year credit metrics in both the cardmember loan and charge card portfolios . charge card provisions decreased $ 54 Â   million or 38 Â   percent to $ 89 Â   million , driven by improving credit performance . cardmember loans provisions decreased $ 727 Â   million or 74 Â   percent to $ 262 Â   million , primarily reflecting a lower uscs cardmember reserve level requirement during the last quarter , due to improving credit performance , partially offset by an increase related to the inclusion of the third quarter 2010 expense for table of contents written-off securitized loans , which in the prior year was reported in securitization income , net . refer to the Â “ cardmember loan portfolio presentation Â ” discussion below . other provisions for losses decreased $ 24 Â   million or 52 Â   percent to $ 22 Â   million , primarily reflecting lower merchant-related reserves . expenses consolidated expenses were $ 5 . 0 Â   billion , up $ 1 . 1 Â   billion or 28 Â   percent from $ 3 . 9 Â   billion for the same period in 2009 . the total expense increase reflected greater marketing and promotion expenses , increased cardmember rewards expenses , higher other , net expenses , greater professional services expenses , higher salaries and employee benefits expenses and increased cardmember services expenses , partially offset by lower occupancy and equipment expense and lower communication expenses . the third quarter of 2009 includes the $ 180 Â   million net benefit from investments in consolidated foreign subsidiaries reported in other , net expenses . marketing and promotion expense increased $ 343 Â   million or 68 Â   percent to $ 847 Â   million , reflecting the increased investment spending resulting from better credit and business trends in the third quarter of 2010 . cardmember rewards expense increased $ 286 Â   million or 29 Â   percent to $ 1 . 3 Â   billion , primarily due to greater rewards-related spending volumes , higher co-brand expense and the benefit in the third quarter of 2009 of a revised , more restrictive , redemption policy for accounts 30 Â   days past due . salaries and employee benefits expense increased $ 93 Â   million or 7 Â   percent to $ 1 . 4 Â   billion , reflecting merit increases , higher benefit-related costs and higher incentive compensation expenses coupled with a flat employee base . professional services expense increased $ 126 Â   million or 22 Â   percent to $ 701 Â   million , in part reflecting higher technology-related expenses . other , net expense increased significantly , primarily reflecting the $ 180 Â   million benefit recorded in the third quarter of 2009 related to a net investment in consolidated foreign subsidiaries . excluding that benefit , other , net expense , increased still substantially reflecting higher travel and entertainment costs , investments in new business initiatives , higher printing and stationary costs and a contribution to the american express foundation . income taxesthe effective tax rate was 33 Â   percent and 30 Â   percent for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively . each of the periods reflects the level of pretax income in relation to recurring permanent tax benefits . consolidated results of operations for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 and 2009the company Â ’ s consolidated net income for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 increased $ 1 . 6 Â   billion compared to the same period a year ago to $ 3 . 0 Â   billion , and diluted eps increased significantly to $ 2 . 47 from $ 0 . 94 . on a trailing 12-month basis , roe was 25 . 9 Â   percent , up from 11 . 7 Â   percent a year ago . the company Â ’ s total revenues net of interest expense and total expenses increased by approximately 14 Â   percent and 21 Â   percent , respectively , and provisions for losses decreased by approximately 57 percent for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 . assuming no changes in foreign currency exchange rates , total revenues net of interest expense and total expenses increased by approximately 12 Â   percent and 19 Â   percent , table of contents respectively , and provisions for losses decreased by approximately 58 Â   percent in the nine months ended september Â   30 , 20103total revenues net of interest expenseconsolidated total revenues net of interest expense were $ 20 . 5 Â   billion , up $ 2 . 5 Â   billion or 14 percent from the same period a year ago . total revenues net of interest expense increased due primarily to higher discount revenues and higher net interest income on the combined securitized and non-securitized loan portfolio , partially offset by lower net card fees . discount revenue increased $ 1 . 3 Â   billion or 13 Â   percent to $ 11 . 0 Â   billion as a result of a 15 Â   percent increase in billed business , partially offset by amounts shared with card issuing partners . the average discount rate was 2 . 56 Â   percent and 2 . 55 Â   percent for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively . united states billed business and billed business outside the united states were up 13 Â   percent and 21 Â   percent , respectively , primarily due to increases in average spending per proprietary basic card . billed business outside the united states was up 15 Â

by making it easier to compare the company Â ’ s performance from one period to another without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates . table of contents assuming no changes in foreign exchange rates , total billed business outside the united states increased 22 Â   percent in asia pacific , 18 Â   percent in latin america , 11 Â   percent in europe and 8 percent in canada . total cards-in-force increased 1 Â   percent worldwide as a 3 Â   percent increase in gns was partially offset by decreases of 1 Â   percent in ics and gcs , while cards-in-force was flat in uscs . during the third quarter of 2010 , the definition of non-proprietary cards-in-force was changed to exclude retail co-brand cardmember accounts in gns that have no out-of-store spend activity during the prior 12-month period . this change caused a reduction to reported cards-in-force of 1 . 6 Â   million . also , for the nine months ended in 2010 , total cards-in-force decreased by 800 , 000 in the united states due to the change described above and increased by 1 . 9 Â   million outside the united states . travel commissions and fees increased $ 152 Â   million or 13 Â   percent to $ 1 . 3 Â   billion , reflecting a 22 percent increase in worldwide travel sales , partially offset by lower travel sales revenue rates . other commissions and fees increased $ 172 Â   million or 13 Â   percent to $ 1 . 5 Â   billion , primarily driven by the new gaap effective january Â   1 , 2010 where fees related to securitized receivables are now recognized as other commissions and fees starting in the first quarter of 2010 . these fees were previously reported in securitization income , net . the increase also reflects foreign currency conversion revenues related to higher spending , partially offset by lower delinquency fees in the non-securitized cardmember loan portfolio . other revenues decreased $ 156 Â   million or 10 Â   percent to $ 1 . 4 Â   billion , primarily related to a second quarter of 2009 gain of $ 211 Â   million on the sale of 50 Â   percent of the company Â ’ s investment in industrial and commercial bank of china ( icbc ) Â   and migration of the corporate payment services ( cps ) Â   portfolio to the american express network during the first quarter of 2009 and lower insurance premium revenue , partially offset by higher gns partner-related revenue . interest income increased $ 1 . 4 Â   billion or 35 Â   percent to $ 5 . 5 Â   billion in 2010 . interest and fees on loans increased $ 1 . 7 Â   billion or 49 Â   percent to $ 5 . 1 Â   billion , driven by the new gaap effective january Â   1 , 2010 . interest income related to securitized receivables was reported in securitization income , net in prior periods , but is now reported in interest and fees on loans . the increase related to the consolidation was partially offset by a lower yield on cardmember loans , reflecting higher payment rates and lower revolving levels , and the implementation of elements of the card act , which were partially offset by the benefit of certain repricing initiatives effective during 2009 and 2010 . worldwide cardmember loan balances of $ 57 . 2 Â   billion as of september Â   30 , 2010 increased 74 . 4 Â   percent from $ 32 . 8 Â   billion as of december Â   31 , 2009 , due to the adoption of the new gaap effective january Â   1 , 2010 . on a comparable managed basis , including securitized loans in both periods , cardmember loan balances of $ 57 . 2 Â   billion declined 7 . 4 Â   percent from $ 61 . 8 Â   billion as of december Â   31 , 2009 , reflecting higher cardmember payment rates and the growth of products with lower revolving balances , partially offset by higher cardmember spending levels during the first half of 2010 . for further discussion of the managed basis presentation , refer to cardmember loan portfolio presentation below . interest and dividends on investment securities decreased $ 234 Â   million or 40 Â   percent to $ 345 million , primarily due to the elimination of interest on retained securities as a result of new gaap effective january Â   1 , 2010 and lower average investment securities , partially offset by higher effective investment yields . interest on deposits with banks and others decreased $ 3 Â   million or 6 percent to $ 45 Â   million , driven by lower other interest income , substantially offset by higher deposit income due to an increase in average interest-bearing deposits . interest expense increased $ 173 Â   million or 11 Â   percent to $ 1 . 8 Â   billion in 2010 . interest on deposits increased $ 107 Â   million or 36 Â   percent to $ 406 Â   million , due to higher average customer deposits , partially offset by lower effective cost of funds . interest on short-term borrowings decreased $ 34 Â   million or 94 Â   percent to $ 2 Â   million , driven by both lower effective cost of funds and average borrowings . interest on long-term debt table of contents and other increased $ 100 Â   million or 8 Â   percent to $ 1 . 4 Â   billion , primarily reflecting the consolidation of long-term debt associated with securitized loans previously held off-balance sheet in accordance with new gaap effective january Â   1 , 2010 . interest expense related to this debt was reported in securitization income , net in prior periods , but is now reported in long-term debt and other interest expense in 2010 . the increase was partially offset by lower average long-term debt . provisions for lossesconsolidated provisions for losses decreased $ 2 . 6 Â   billion or 57 Â   percent over last year to $ 2 . 0 billion , due to the benefit of improving credit performance in both the loan and charge card portfolios . charge card provisions decreased $ 304 Â   million or 42 Â   percent to $ 412 Â   million , driven by lower reserve requirements due to improved credit performance , partially offset by an increase in average charge card receivables . cardmember loans provisions decreased $ 2 . 2 Â   billion or 60 Â   percent to $ 1 . 5 Â   billion , primarily reflecting lower reserve requirements due to improved credit performance . other provisions for losses decreased $ 77 Â   million or 54 Â   percent to $ 66 Â   million , reflecting lower merchant-related reserves . expenses consolidated expenses were $ 14 . 0 Â   billion , up $ 2 . 5 Â   billion or 21 Â   percent from $ 11 . 6 Â   billion for the same period in 2009 . the increase was a result of increased marketing and promotion expense , cardmember rewards expense , higher professional services expense and other , net expense . marketing and promotion expense increased $ 1 . 0 Â   billion or 87 Â   percent to $ 2 . 2 Â   billion , reflecting higher levels of investments in the business as the credit and business environment improves . cardmember rewards expense increased $ 827 Â   million or 29 Â   percent to $ 3 . 7 Â   billion , driven by higher volume-related rewards costs , co-brand expenses and 2009 benefits due to the change in united states membership rewards program . cardmember services expense increased $ 32 Â   million or 9 Â   percent to $ 406 Â   million , primarily due to higher other cardmember services . professional services expense increased $ 205 Â   million or 12 Â   percent to $ 1 . 9 Â   billion , primarily driven by higher technology-related expenses , partially offset by lower collection costs . other , net expense increased $ 255 Â   million , primarily reflecting the $ 180 Â   million benefit recorded in the third quarter of 2009 related to a net investment in a foreign subsidiary and higher expenses on travel and entertainment . income taxesthe effective tax rate was 33 Â   percent and 24 Â   percent for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively . each of the periods reflects the level of pretax income in relation to recurring permanent tax benefits . the tax rate for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 also includes the impact of a $ 44 Â   million valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets associated with certain of the company Â ’ s non-u . s . travel operations . table of contents consolidated capital resources and liquiditycapital strategy the company Â ’ s objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through earnings and other sources to maintain a solid equity capital base and to provide flexibility to satisfy future business growth . the company believes capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk-adjusted equity in excess of its costs will generate shareholder value . the level and composition of the company Â ’ s equity capital are determined in large part by the company Â ’ s internal assessment of its business activities , as well as rating agency and regulatory capital requirements . they are also influenced by subsidiary capital requirements , including that of american express centurion bank and american express bank , fsb , which have their own separate capital requirements , as well as the business environment , and by conditions in the debt capital markets . the company , as a bank holding company , is subject to regulatory requirements administered by the u . s . federal banking agencies . the federal reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets , liabilities , and certain off-balance sheet items . the recently passed dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act , as well as a series of international capital and liquidity standards proposed by the basel committee on banking supervision ( commonly referred to as basel iii ) , will in the future change these current quantitative measures . in general , these changes will involve , for the united states banking industry as a whole , a reduction in the amount of eligible capital that banks are deemed to hold and an increase in the amount of capital that their assets , liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items require . the company currently reports its capital ratios under the measurement standards commonly referred to as basel i . thus , these changes will generally serve to reduce reported capital ratios compared to current capital guidelines . the specific guidelines supporting the new legislation have not been finalized but are generally expected to be issued within the next 18 Â   months . in addition to these measurement changes , international and united states banking regulators could increase the ratio levels at which banks would be deemed to be Â “ well-capitalized . Â ” the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) Â   amended the accounting for off-balance sheet securitization activities beginning january Â   1 , 2010 , which resulted in the company consolidating the assets ( primarily cardmember loans ) and liabilities ( primarily debt certificates ) of the lending trust . both the cardmember loans , net of the impact for any expected credit losses , and the debt are consolidated by american express travel related services ( trs ) , a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company . refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impact of the consolidation of the lending trust . table of contents the following table presents the regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio for the company

contents tier 1 leverage ratio the following provides definitions of non-regulatory capital ratios , which however are widely used in the industry in which the company operates , although they may be calculated differently by different companies . tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio common equity and tangible common equity to risk weighted assets ratios the company seeks to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements ; failure to maintain minimum capital levels could cause the respective regulatory agencies to take actions that could limit the company Â ’ s business operations . the company Â ’ s primary source of equity capital has been through the generation of net income . historically , capital generated through net income and other sources such as employee benefit plans has exceeded the growth in its capital requirements . to the extent capital has exceeded business , regulatory , and rating agency requirements , the company has returned excess capital to shareholders through its regular common dividend and its share repurchase program . the company maintains certain flexibility to shift capital across its businesses as appropriate . for example , the company may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements . these infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity level for american express Â ’ parent company ( parent company ) . share repurchases and dividendsthe company has a share repurchase program to return excess capital to shareholders . these share repurchases reduce shares outstanding and offset , in whole or in part , the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans . on a cumulative basis , since 1994 the company has distributed 64 Â   percent of capital generated through share repurchases and dividends . no shares have been repurchased over the past ten quarters , as share repurchases were suspended during the first quarter of 2008 in light of the challenging global economic environment . the company has commenced its share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2010 to the extent of shares issued under employee programs . during the three months ended september Â   30 , 2010 , the company returned $ 217 Â   million in dividends to shareholders , which represents approximately 17 Â   percent of total capital generated . during the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 , the company returned $ 650 Â   million in dividends to shareholders , which represents approximately 19 Â   percent of the total capital generated . table of contents fundingthe company has in place a funding policy covering american express company and all its subsidiaries . the principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well-diversified funding sources to allow the company to meet its maturing obligations , cost-effectively finance current and future asset growth in its global businesses as well as maintain a strong liquidity profile . the diversity of funding sources by type of debt instrument , by maturity and by investor base , among other factors , reduces reliance on any one type of debt , maturity , or investor . the mix of the company Â ’ s funding in any period will seek to achieve cost-efficiency consistent with both maintaining diversified sources and achieving its liquidity objectives . the company Â ’ s funding strategy and activities are integrated into its asset-liability management activities . the company meets its funding needs through a variety of sources , including debt instruments such as senior unsecured debentures , asset securitizations and commercial paper , as well as retail deposits placed with the company Â ’ s u . s . banks , and long-term committed bank borrowing facilities in certain non-u . s . markets . during the third quarter of 2010 , the company issued $ 2 . 0 Â   billion of senior unsecured debt with a maturity of five years and a coupon of 2 . 75 % . as of september Â   30 , 2010 , the company had $ 1 . 9 Â   billion of short-term borrowings ( including $ 0 . 9 billion of commercial paper outstanding ) , which are generally used to meet working capital needs and which represent a small proportion of the company Â ’ s total funding requirement . short-term borrowings have been stable over the past several quarters , showing little month-over-month variance . the company also had $ 28 . 4 Â   billion of outstanding retail deposits at the end of the third quarter . see Â “ deposit programs Â ” section below for more details . the company Â ’ s equity capital and funding strategies are designed , among other things , to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies , moody Â ’ s investor services ( moody Â ’ s ) , standard & poor Â ’ s ( s & p ) , fitch ratings ( fitch ) , and dominion bond rating services ( dbrs ) . such ratings support the company Â ’ s access to cost effective unsecured funding as part of its overall financing programs . ratings for the company Â ’ s abs activities are evaluated separately . unsecured debt ratings Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   long-term Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   short-term Â   senior Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   debt and Â

company Â ’ s unsecured debt or asset securitization program Â ’ s securities ratings could result in higher interest expense on the company Â ’ s unsecured debt and asset securitizations , as well as higher fees related to borrowings under its unused lines of credit . in addition to increased funding costs , a decline in credit ratings could reduce the company Â ’ s borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets . the company believes the change in its funding mix , which now includes an increasing proportion of fdic-insured ( as defined below ) u . s . retail deposits , should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on the company Â ’ s funding capacity and costs . table of contents deposit programsamerican express centurion bank and american express bank , fsb ( fsb ) Â   offer retail deposits . these funds are insured up to $ 250 , 000 per account , through the federal deposit insurance corporation ( fdic ) . during the second quarter of 2009 , fsb launched a direct deposit-taking program , personal savings from american express , to supplement its distribution of deposit products through third-party distribution channels . this program makes fdic-insured certificates of deposit ( cds ) and high-yield savings account products available directly to consumers . during the third quarter of 2010 , within u . s . retail deposits the company continued to focus on growing both the number of accounts and the total balances outstanding on savings accounts and cds that were sourced directly with consumers through personal savings from american express . these accounts and balances grew during the quarter , and financed the maturities of cds issued in prior quarters through third-party distribution channels . the company held the following deposits as of september Â   30 , 2010 and december Â   31 , 2009 : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( billions ) Â   2010 Â   Â   2009 Â   u . s . retail

and through third-party distribution channels . asset securitization programsthe company periodically securitizes cardmember receivables and loans arising from its card business , as the securitization market provides the company with cost-effective funding . securitization of cardmember receivables and loans is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust , which in turn issues certificates or notes ( securities ) Â   collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors . the proceeds from issuance are distributed to the company , through its wholly-owned subsidiaries , as consideration for the transferred assets . refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the adoption of new gaap effective january Â   1 , 2010 . securitization of cardmember receivables generated under designated consumer charge card , small business charge card and corporate charge card accounts is accomplished through the transfer of cardmember receivables to the american express issuance trust ( charge trust ) . securitization of the company Â ’ s cardmember loans generated under designated consumer lending accounts is accomplished through the transfer of cardmember loans to the american express credit account master trust ( lending trust ) . the company consolidates the charge trust and the lending trust . accordingly , the receivables and loans being securitized are reported as owned assets on the company Â ’ s consolidated balance sheets and the related securities issued to third-party investors are reported as long-term debt on the company Â ’ s consolidated balance sheets . under the respective terms of the lending trust and the charge trust agreements , the occurrence of certain events could result in payment of trust expenses , establishment of reserve funds , or in a worst-case scenario , early amortization of investor certificates . as of september Â   30 , 2010 , no triggering events have occurred that would have resulted in the funding of reserve accounts or early amortization . on september Â   27 , 2010 , the fdic promulgated a new safe harbor rule relating to the fdic Â ’ s treatment of securitized assets in the event of a sponsoring financial institution Â ’ s receivership or conservatorship . pursuant to the new safe harbor rule , the fdic will not seek to reclaim , recover or recharacterize any table of contents transfer of any financial asset transferred in connection with a preexisting securitization revolving trust or master trust , provided that such transfer met all conditions for sale accounting in accordance with gaap in effect for reporting periods prior to november Â   15 , 2009 . the lending trust is among the securitization trusts covered by the fdic Â ’ s new safe harbor rule . the new safe harbor rule applies to all new issuances under the lending trust . while the charge trust does not satisfy the criteria required to be covered by the fdic Â ’ s new safe harbor rule , it was structured and continues to be structured such that the financial assets transferred to the charge trust would not be deemed to be property of the sponsoring banks in the event the fdic is appointed as a receiver or conservator of the sponsoring banks . nevertheless , one or more of the rating agencies may ultimately conclude that in the absence of compliance with the safe harbor rule , the highest rating a charge trust security could receive would be based on the sponsoring bank Â ’ s unsecured debt rating . if one or more rating agencies come to this conclusion it could adversely impact the company Â ’ s capacity and cost of using its charge trust as a source of funding for its business . refer to certain legislative , regulatory and other developments section below for additional information regarding matters affecting offerings of asset-backed securities . committed bank credit facilitiesas of september Â   30 , 2010 , the company maintained committed bank lines of credit totaling $ 10 . 3 billion , of which $ 3 . 9 Â   billion was drawn . these draw downs are part of the company Â ’ s normal funding activities . the company Â ’ s subsidiary , american express credit corporation ( credco ) , has an allocation of $ 8 . 8 Â   billion under these facilities and also has access to the parent company Â ’ s allocation of $ 0 . 8 Â   billion for a maximum borrowing capacity of $ 9 . 6 Â   billion . the company allowed certain credit facilities totaling approximately $ 2 . 0 Â   billion to expire on july Â   30 , 2010 . liquidity managementthe company has in place a liquidity risk policy that sets out the company Â ’ s approach to managing liquidity risk on an enterprise-wide basis . the company Â ’ s liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on and off-balance sheet sources of liquidity , such that the company can continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements , even in the event it is unable to raise new funds under its regular funding programs . the company incurs and accepts liquidity risk arising in the normal course of offering its products and services . the liquidity risks that the company is exposed to can arise from a variety of sources , and thus its liquidity management strategy includes a variety of parameters , assessments and guidelines , including but not limited to : Â   Â • Â   maintaining a diversified set of funding sources ( refer to funding section for more details ) ; Â   Â   Â • Â   maintaining unencumbered , liquid assets and off-balance sheet liquidity sources ; and Â   Â   Â • Â   projecting cash inflows and outflows from a variety of sources and under a variety of scenarios , including contingent liquidity exposures such as unused cardmember lines of credit and collateral requirements for derivative transactions . the company Â ’ s current liquidity target is to have adequate liquidity in the form of excess cash and readily-marketable securities that are easily convertible into cash , to satisfy all maturing long-term funding obligations for a 12-month period , in addition to having access to significant off-balance sheet liquidity sources . table of contents as of september Â   30 , 2010 , the company Â ’ s excess cash and readily-marketable securities available to fund long-term maturities were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( billions ) Â   Â   Â   Â   cash Â   $ 22 . 5 ( a ) readily-marketable securities Â   Â   9 . 9 ( b ) Â   Â   Â   Â   cash and

Â   ( b ) Â   consists of certain available-for-sale investment securities ( u . s . treasury and agency securities and u . s . government-guaranteed debt ) that are considered highly liquid and either mature prior to the maturity of borrowings that will occur within the next 12 Â   months , or could be sold or pledged under sale / repurchase agreements to raise cash . Â   ( c ) Â   cash on hand for day-to-day operations . Â   ( d ) Â   consists of commercial paper and u . s . retail cds with original maturities of three and six months . the upcoming approximate maturities of the company Â ’ s long-term unsecured debt ,

expected to arise from these maturities as well as changes in business needs , primarily changes in outstanding cardmember loans and receivables . the company considers various factors in determining the amount of liquidity it maintains , such as economic and financial market conditions , seasonality in business operations , growth in its businesses , the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources , and regulatory and credit rating agency considerations . the yield the company receives on its cash and readily-marketable securities is generally less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances . thus , the company incurs substantial net interest costs on these amounts . the level of net interest costs will be dependent on the size of the company Â ’ s cash and readily-marketable securities holdings , as well as the difference between the cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields . in addition to its cash and readily-marketable securities , the company continues to maintain a variety of contingent liquidity resources , such as access to secured borrowing from the federal reserve bank of san francisco through the federal reserve discount window , and committed bank credit facilities . table of contents cash flows from operating activitiesthe company generated net cash provided by operating activities in amounts greater than net income for both the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 and 2009 , primarily due to provisions for losses , which represent expenses in the consolidated statements of income but do not require cash at the time of provision . similarly , depreciation and amortization represent non-cash expenses . in addition , for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 , net cash was provided by net income , deferred taxes , acquisition costs and other and fluctuations in accounts payable and other liabilities , partially offset by fluctuations in travelers cheques outstanding , other assets and other receivables . for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2009 , net cash was provided by net income and fluctuations in other receivables and other assets , partially offset by deferred taxes , acquisition costs and other and fluctuations in accounts payable and other liabilities and travelers cheques outstanding . these accounts vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of various payments . for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 , net cash provided by operating activities of $ 7 . 2 billion increased $ 2 . 3 Â   billion compared to the same period in 2009 . the increase was primarily due to fluctuations in accounts payable and other liabilities and deferred taxes , acquisition costs and other , as well as an increase in net income , partially offset by lower provisions for losses and fluctuations in other receivables and other assets . cash flows from investing activitiesthe company Â ’ s investing activities primarily include funding cardmember loans and receivables and the company Â ’ s available-for-sale investment portfolio . for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 , net cash provided by investing activities of $ 5 . 3 billion increased $ 5 . 6 Â   billion compared to the same period in 2009 . the increase was primarily due to increased maturity and redemption of investments ; lower purchases of investments ; maturities of cardmember loan securitizations in 2009 resulting in an increase in an undivided pro-rata interest in an unconsolidated vie ( historically referred to as Â “ seller Â ’ s interest Â ” ) ; and fluctuations in restricted cash primarily due to a decrease in restricted cash of a consolidated vie in 2010 , which was used to pay down long-term debt of the consolidated vie , partially offset by changes in the net decrease in cardmember loans and receivables and decrease in sale of investments . cash flows from financing activitiesthe company Â ’ s financing activities primarily include issuing and repaying debt , taking customer deposits , paying dividends and repurchasing its common shares . for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 , net cash used in financing activities of $ 7 . 9 Â   billion increased $ 1 . 3 Â   billion compared to the same period in 2009 . the increase was primarily due to a fluctuation in customer deposits and decrease in issuance of long-term debt , partially offset by decreased cash outflow to repay short-term borrowings . table of contents certain legislative , regulatory and other developments as a participant in the financial services industry , the company is subject to a wide array of regulations applicable to its businesses . the company is a bank holding company and is subject to the supervision of the federal reserve . as such , the company is subject to the federal reserve Â ’ s regulations and policies , including its regulatory capital requirements . in addition , the extreme disruptions in the capital markets that commenced in mid-2007 and the resulting instability and failure of numerous financial institutions have led to a number of changes in the financial services industry , including significant additional regulation and the formation of additional regulatory bodies . the company Â ’ s conversion to a bank holding company in the fourth quarter of 2008 has increased the scope of its regulatory oversight and its compliance program . in addition , although the long-term impact on the company of much of the recent and pending legislative and regulatory initiatives remains uncertain , the company expects that compliance requirements and expenditures will continue to rise for financial services firms , including the company , as the legislation and rules become effective over the course of the next several years . the card actin may Â   2009 , the u . s . congress passed , and the president of the united states signed into law , legislation , known as the card act , to fundamentally reform credit card billing practices , pricing and disclosure requirements . this legislation accelerated the effective date and expanded the scope of amendments to the rules regarding unfair or deceptive acts or practices ( udap ) Â   and truth in lending act that restrict certain credit and charge card practices and require expanded disclosures to consumers , which were adopted in december Â   2008 by federal bank regulators in the united states . together , the legislation and the regulatory amendments , portions of which became effective commencing august Â   2009 , include , among other matters , rules relating to the imposition by card issuers of interest rate increases on outstanding balances and the allocation of payments in respect of outstanding balances with different interest rates . certain other provisions of the card act effective in august Â   2010 require penalty fees to be reasonable and proportional in relation to the circumstances for which such fees are levied and require issuers to evaluate past interest rate increases twice per year to determine whether it is appropriate to reduce such increases . the company has made changes to its product terms and practices that are designed to mitigate the impact on company revenue of the changes required by the card act and the regulatory amendments . these changes include instituting product-specific increases in pricing on purchases and cash advances , modifying the criteria pursuant to which the penalty rate of interest is imposed on a cardmember and assessing late fees on certain charge products at an earlier date than previously assessed . although the company believes its actions to mitigate the impact of the card act have , to date , been largely effective ( as evidenced in part by the net interest yield for its u . s . lending portfolio ) , the impacts of certain other provisions of the card act are still subject to some uncertainty ( such as the requirement to periodically reevaluate apr increases and the proposed amendments to the card act Â ’ s implementing regulations published by the federal reserve on october 19 , 2010 ) . accordingly , in the event the actions undertaken by the company to date to offset the impact of the new legislation and regulations are not ultimately effective , they could have a material adverse effect on the company Â ’ s results of operations , including its revenue and net income . dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( the Â “ reform act Â ” ) in july Â   2010 , president obama signed into law the reform act . the reform act is comprehensive in scope and contains a wide array of provisions intending to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets . among other matters , the law creates a new independent consumer financial protection bureau , which will regulate consumer credit across the u . s . economy . the bureau will have broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit , savings , payment and other consumer financial products and services . under the reform act , the federal reserve is authorized to regulate interchange fees paid to banks on debit card transactions to ensure that they are Â “ reasonable and proportional Â ” to the cost of processing individual transactions , and to prohibit debit card networks and issuers from requiring transactions to be processed on a single payment network . the reform act also prohibits credit / debit network rules that would restrict a table of contents merchant from offering discounts to customers in order to encourage them to use a particular form of payment , as long as such discounts do not discriminate among issuers or networks , and that would restrict a merchant from setting certain minimum and maximum transaction amounts for credit cards . the reform act has also eliminated an exception to certain types of liabilities applicable to rating agencies under the securities laws , which has resulted in the agencies Â ’ declining to give their consent to disclose ratings in registered offerings . this circumstance is of particular significance in offerings of asset-backed securities ( Â “ abs offerings Â ” ) , which require ratings disclosure that , subsequent to the reform act , can be made only with rating agency consent . although the sec staff has effectively relieved issuers from the ratings disclosure requirement through january Â   2011 , if the rating agencies do not change their position , the company will not be able to issue abs securities in registered offerings after such time , and may have to rely on private offerings to raise funding through its abs program . the reform act also authorizes the federal reserve to establish heightened capital , leverage and liquidity standards , risk management requirements , concentration limits on credit exposures , mandatory resolution plans ( so-called Â “ living wills Â ” ) and stress tests for , among others , large bank holding companies , such as the company , that have greater than $ 50 Â   billion in assets . in addition , most interest rate and currency swaps will be required to be centrally cleared , which may increase collateral posting requirements for the company . many provisions of the reform act require the adoption of rules to implement . in addition , the reform act mandates multiple studies , which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action . these new rules and studies will be implemented and undertaken over a period of several years . accordingly , the ultimate consequences of the reform act and its implementing regulations on the company Â ’ s business , results of operations and financial condition are uncertain at this time . other legislative and regulatory initiativesin addition , other legislative initiatives remain in congress , including a proposed Â “ financial crisis responsibility fee Â ” that would be assessed on large financial institutions at approximately 0 . 15 Â   percent of total assets ( less tier 1 capital and less fdic-assessed deposits ) for at least the next ten years for the purpose of recovering projected losses from the troubled asset relief program , and other potential assessments . governments outside the united states are also considering wide-ranging and comprehensive financial services industry reform proposals , including various taxes on financial transactions and financial institutions Â ’ profits , assets , and compensation . any such legislative and regulatory changes could impact the profitability of the company Â ’ s business activities , require the company to change certain of its business practices and expose it to additional costs ( including increased compliance costs ) . the credit and charge card industry also faces continuing scrutiny in connection with the fees merchants are charged to accept cards . although investigations into the way bankcard network members collectively set the Â “ interchange Â ” ( that is , the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuing bank in Â “ four party Â ” payment networks , like visa and mastercard ) had largely been a subject of regulators outside the united states , legislation has been introduced in congress designed to give merchants antitrust immunity to negotiate interchange collectively with card networks and to regulate certain card network practices . although , unlike the visa and mastercard networks , the american express network does not collectively set fees , antitrust actions and government regulation of the bankcard networks Â ’ pricing could ultimately affect all networks . in addition to the provisions of the reform act regarding merchants ability to offer discounts , a number of u . s . states are also considering legislation that would prohibit card networks from imposing conditions , restrictions or penalties on a merchant if the merchant , among other things , ( i ) Â   provides a discount to a customer for using one form of payment versus another or one type of credit or charge card versus another , table of contents ( ii ) Â   imposes a minimum dollar requirement on customers with respect to the use of credit or charge cards or ( iii ) Â   chooses to accept credit and charge cards at some of its locations but not at others . such legislation has recently been enacted in vermont , and is pending enactment in several other states . also , other countries in which the company operates have been considering and in some cases adopting similar legislation and rules that would impose changes on certain practices of card issuers and bankcard networks , which could have a material adverse effect on the company Â ’ s results of operations . our results of operations also could be adversely impacted by various proposals to reform the taxation of income earned by u . s . companies Â ’ international business operations and by other legislative action or inaction , including the potential failure of the u . s . congress to extend the active financing exception to subpart f of the internal revenue code . in december Â   2009 , the basel committee on banking supervision of the bank of international settlements ( bis ) Â   released a comprehensive list of proposals of new and revised international capital and liquidity standards for banks . these proposals , if enacted , could have a substantial impact on the capital structure and liquidity profiles of the banking industry , including those of the company . the committee is evaluating comments it received on the proposals prior to finalizing the content and timing of implementation of the proposals . during 2010 , the committee issued several statements that reflected , among other things , tentative decisions it has reached on certain elements of the comprehensive proposals , including timelines for implementation , while re-affirming its goal to issue the proposals in final form before year end . refer to capital strategy above . table of contents business segment resultsbeginning in the first quarter of 2010 , the company made changes to the manner in which it allocates equity capital as well as funding and the related interest expense charged to its reportable operating segments . the changes reflect the inclusion of additional factors in its allocation methodologies that the company believes more accurately reflect the capital characteristics and funding requirements of its segments . the segment results for quarters prior to the first quarter of 2010 have been revised for this change . debt , cash and investment balances associated with the company Â ’ s excess liquidity funding and the related net negative interest spread continues to be reported in the corporate & other segment . the change to interest allocation also impacted the consolidated and segment reported net interest yield on cardmember loans . as discussed more fully below , results are presented on a gaap basis unless otherwise stated .

Â   ( f ) Â   net interest yield on cardmember loans is a non-gaap financial measure that represents the net spread earned on cardmember loans . net interest yield on cardmember loans is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by adjusted average loans , computed on an annualized basis . the calculation of net interest yield on cardmember loans includes interest that is deemed uncollectible . for all presentations of net interest yield on cardmember loans , reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses Â — cardmember loans ; therefore , such reserves and net write-offs are not included in the net interest yield calculation . Â   ( g ) Â   for periods ended on or prior to december Â   31 , 2009 , information presented is based on the company Â ’ s historical non-gaap , or Â “ managed Â ” basis presentation . unlike the gaap basis presentation , the information presented on a managed basis in such periods includes both the securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans . the adoption of new gaap on january Â   1 , 2010 resulted in accounting for both the company Â ’ s securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans in the consolidated financial statements . as a result , the company Â ’ s 2010 gaap presentations and managed basis presentations prior to 2010 are generally comparable . refer to page 66 for a discussion of managed basis information . Â   ( h ) Â   for periods ended on or prior to december Â   31 , 2009 , the information presented includes the adjustments to the gaap Â “ owned Â ” basis presentation for such periods attributable to securitization activity for interest income and interest expense to arrive at the non-gaap Â “ managed Â ” basis information , which adjustments are set forth under the u . s . card services managed basis presentation on page 67 . table of contents results of operations for the three and nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 and 2009the following discussion of u . s . card services Â ’ segment results of operations is presented on a gaap basis . u . s . card services reported segment income of $ 595 Â   million for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2010 , a $ 437 Â   million increase from $ 158 Â   million for the same period a year ago . for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 , u . s . card services reported segment income of $ 1 . 5 Â   billion , a $ 1 . 5 billion increase from a loss of $ 2 Â   million for the same period a year ago . total revenues net of interest expense increased $ 682 Â   million or 23 Â   percent to $ 3 . 7 Â   billion for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2010 and $ 1 . 9 Â   billion or 21 Â   percent to $ 10 . 8 Â   billion for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 , driven primarily by the increase in interest income and discount revenue partially offset by the increase in interest expense and lower net card fees . discount revenue , net card fees and other was $ 2 . 5 Â   billion for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2010 , an increase of $ 278 Â   million or 12 Â   percent from $ 2 . 3 Â   billion for the same period a year ago . the increase is primarily due to a 12 Â   percent increase in billed business . this line also reflects higher other commissions and fees driven by the new gaap effective january Â   1 , 2010 , which led to the inclusion of fees formerly recorded in securitization income , net . discount revenue , net card fees and other increased $ 663 Â   million or 10 Â   percent to $ 7 . 4 Â   billion for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 , due to the impact of the new gaap effective january Â   1 , 2010 , higher discount revenue and travel revenue , partially offset by lower net card fees . interest income of $ 1 . 3 Â   billion and $ 4 . 1 Â   billion for the three and nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 , respectively , increased $ 558 Â   million or 72 Â   percent and $ 1 . 6 Â   billion or 65 Â   percent , respectively , due to the first quarter 2010 consolidation of securitized cardmember loans , partially offset by lower yields on cardmember loans within the managed portfolio . interest expense of $ 210 Â   million and $ 604 Â   million for the three and nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 , respectively , increased $ 83 Â   million or 65 Â   percent and $ 169 Â   million or 39 Â   percent , respectively , as compared to a year ago , reflecting higher expense related to the first quarter 2010 consolidation of off-balance sheet debt and a higher cost of funds . provisions for losses of $ 274 Â   million decreased $ 576 Â   million or 68 Â   percent for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2010 , principally reflecting improving cardmember loan and charge card credit trends , partially offset by the inclusion of write-offs on the securitized cardmember loans . provisions for losses of $ 1 . 5 Â   billion decreased $ 1 . 9 Â   billion or 57 Â   percent for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 , primarily driven by improved credit performance , partially offset by the impact of new gaap effective january Â   1 , 2010 . expenses were $ 2 . 4 Â   billion and $ 6 . 9 Â   billion for the three and nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 , respectively , an increase of $ 505 Â   million or 26 Â   percent and $ 1 . 3 Â   billion or 23 Â   percent , respectively , due to increased marketing , promotion , rewards and cardmember services expenses , and salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses . marketing , promotion , rewards and cardmember services expenses of $ 1 . 5 Â   billion and $ 4 . 1 Â   billion for the three and nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 , respectively , increased $ 405 Â   million or 39 percent and $ 1 . 2 Â   billion or 40 Â   percent , respectively , reflecting increased marketing and promotion expense , due to increased investment spending resulting from better credit and business trends in the third quarter 2010 and higher rewards costs due to greater rewards-related spending volumes and higher co-brand expense . rewards expense growth also reflects the benefit in third quarter 2009 of a revised , more restrictive redemption policy for accounts 30 Â   days past due . table of contents salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses were $ 964 Â   million for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2010 , an increase of $ 100 Â   million or 12 Â   percent , reflecting higher technology and partner-related investments . salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses were $ 2 . 7 Â   billion for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 , an increase of $ 107 Â   million or 4 percent , reflecting higher technology charges and partner payments , offset by a benefit related to hedging the company Â ’ s fixed-rate debt and lower salaries and employee benefits . the effective tax rate was 39 Â   percent and 38 Â   percent for the three and nine months ended september 30 , 2010 , respectively . the effective tax rate was 28 Â   percent and 97 Â   percent for the three and nine months ended september Â   30 , 2009 , respectively . the tax rate for the three and nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 reflects charges resulting from adjustments to certain tax accounts . the tax rate for the three and nine months ended september Â   30 , 2009 reflects the benefit from the resolution of certain prior year tax items . table of contents cardmember loan portfolio presentationfor periods ended on or prior to december Â   31 , 2009 , the company Â ’ s non-securitized cardmember loan and related debt performance information on a gaap basis was referred to as the Â “ owned Â ” basis presentation . for such periods , the company also provided information on a non-gaap Â “ managed Â ” basis . unlike the gaap basis presentation , the managed basis presentation in such periods assumed there had been no off-balance sheet securitizations for the company Â ’ s u . s . card services segment ( the company has not securitized its international cardmember loans ) , resulting in the inclusion of all securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans and related debt in the company Â ’ s performance information . under the gaap basis presentation prior to securitization for the period ended on or prior to december Â   31 , 2009 , revenues and expenses from cardmember loans and related debt were reflected in the company Â ’ s income statements in other commissions and fees , net interest income and provisions for losses for cardmember loans . at the time of a securitization transaction , the securitized cardmember loans were removed from the company Â ’ s balance sheet , and the resulting gain on sale was reflected in securitization income , net , as well as a reduction to the provision for losses ( credit reserves were no longer recorded for the cardmember loans once sold ) . over the life of a securitization transaction , the company recognized the net cash flow from interest and fee collections on interests sold to investors ( the investors Â ’ interests ) after deducting interest paid on the investors Â ’ certificates , credit losses , contractual service fees , other expenses and changes in the fair value of the interest-only strip ( referred to as Â “ excess spread Â ” ) . these amounts , in addition to servicing fees and the non-credit components of the gains / ( losses ) from securitization activities were reflected in securitization income , net . the company also recognized interest income over the life of the securitization transaction related to the interest it retained ( i . e . , the seller Â ’ s interest ) . at the maturity of a securitization transaction , cardmember loans on the balance sheet increased , and the impact of the incremental required loss reserves was recorded in provisions for losses . under the managed basis presentation for periods ended on or prior to december Â   31 , 2009 , revenues and expenses related to securitized cardmember loans and related debt were reflected in other commissions and fees ( included in discount revenue , net card fees and other ) , interest income , interest expense and provisions for losses . in addition , there was no securitization income , net as this presentation assumed no securitization transactions had occurred . historically , the company included uscs information on a managed basis , as that was the manner in which the company Â ’ s management viewed and managed the business . management believed a full picture of trends in the company Â ’ s cardmember loans business could only be derived by evaluating the performance of both securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans , as the presentation of the entire cardmember loan portfolio was more representative of the economics of the aggregate cardmember relationships and ongoing business performance and related trends over time . the managed basis presentation also provided investors a more comprehensive assessment of the information necessary for the company and investors to evaluate the company Â ’ s market share . the adoption of new gaap on january Â   1 , 2010 resulted in accounting for both the company Â ’ s securitized and non-securitized cardmember loans in the consolidated financial statements . as a result , the company Â ’ s 2010 gaap presentations and managed basis presentations prior to 2010 are generally comparable . for additional information on the differences between the company Â ’ s historical gaap and managed basis presentations , see the company Â ’ s financial review included in the company Â ’ s annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december Â   31 , 2009 . table of contents the following table sets forth cardmember loan portfolio financial information for the three and nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 . the september Â   30 , 2010 financial information was determined in accordance with the new gaap effective january Â   1 , 2010 . the september Â   30 , 2009 information includes the Â “ owned Â ” ( gaap ) Â   basis presentation , together with the adjustments for securitization activity to arrive at the Â “ managed Â ” ( non-gaap ) basis presentation . for additional information , see Â “ cardmember loan portfolio presentation Â ” above . u . s . card services Â   Â   Â   Â

and nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 , respectively , reflecting higher billed business volumes . interest income for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2010 decreased $ 156 Â   million or 10 Â   percent to $ 1 . 3 Â   billion , due to a decline of 7 Â   percent in the average managed loan portfolio balance and a lower portfolio yield . the lower yield was driven by higher payment rates , lower revolving levels and the card act , partially offset by repricing initiatives . interest income for the nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 , decreased $ 773 Â   million or 16 Â   percent to $ 4 . 1 Â   billion primarily due to 11 percent decline in the average managed loan balances and a lower portfolio yield as compared to a year ago . interest expense increased $ 25 Â

Â   ( c ) Â   effective january Â   1 , 2010 , the company revised the time period in which past due cardmember receivables in international card services are written off to when they are 180 Â   days past due or earlier , consistent with applicable bank regulatory guidance and the write-off methodology adopted for u . s . card services in the fourth quarter of 2008 . previously , receivables were written off when they were 360 Â   days past billing or earlier . therefore , the net write-offs for the first quarter of 2010 include net write-offs of approximately $ 60 Â   million for international card services resulting from this write-off methodology change , which increased the net loss ratio and decreased the 90 Â   days past billing metric for this segment , but did not have a substantial impact on provisions for losses . Â   ( d ) Â   beginning with the first quarter of 2010 , the company has revised the net loss ratio to exclude net write-offs related to unauthorized transactions , consistent with the methodology for calculation of the net write-off rate for u . s . card services . the metrics for prior periods have not been revised for this change as it was deemed immaterial . Â   ( e ) Â   see below for calculations of net interest yield on cardmember loans , a non-gaap measure , and net interest income divided by average loans , a gaap measure . management believes net interest yield on cardmember loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of the company Â ’ s cardmember loan portfolio . Â   ( f ) Â   this calculation includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the cardmember loan portfolio , and thus is not representative of net interest yield on cardmember loans . the calculation includes interest income and interest expense attributable to investment securities and other interest-bearing deposits as well as to cardmember loans , and interest expense attributable to other activities , including cardmember receivables . table of contents international card servicescalculation of net interest yield on cardmember loans ( a ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   three months ended Â   Â   nine months ended Â   Â   Â   september 30 , Â   Â   september 30 , Â   ( millions , except for percentages and where indicated ) Â   2010 Â   Â   2009 Â   Â   2010 Â   Â   2009 Â   net interest income Â   $ 237 Â   Â   $ 279 Â   Â   $ 737 Â   Â   $ 811 Â   average loans ( billions ) Â   $ 8 . 3 Â   Â   $ 8 . 9 Â   Â   $ 8 . 5 Â   Â   $ 8 . 8 Â   adjusted net interest income ( b ) Â   $ 231 Â   Â   $ 279 Â   Â   $ 718 Â   Â   $ 818 Â   adjusted average loans ( billions ) ( c ) Â   $ 8 . 2 Â   Â   $ 8 . 9 Â   Â   $ 8 . 4 Â   Â   $ 8 . 9 Â   net interest income divided by average loans ( d ) Â   Â   11 . 3 % Â   Â   12 . 4 % Â   Â   11 . 6 % Â   Â   12 . 3 % net interest yield on cardmember loans ( e ) Â   Â   11 . 1 % Â   Â   12 . 4 % Â   Â   11 . 3 % Â   Â   12 . 3 % Â   ( a ) Â   beginning in the first quarter of 2010 , the company changed the manner in which it allocates capital and related interest expense to its reportable operating segments to more accurately reflect the funding and capital characteristics of its segments . the change to interest allocation impacted the segment Â ’ s net interest yield on cardmember loans . accordingly , the net interest yields for periods prior to the first quarter of 2010 have been revised for this change . Â   ( b ) Â   represents net interest income allocated to the company Â ’ s cardmember loans portfolio , excluding the impact of card fees on loans and balance transfer fees attributable to the company Â ’ s cardmember loans . Â   ( c ) Â   represents average cardmember loans excluding the impact of deferred card fees , net of deferred direct acquisition costs of cardmember loans . Â   ( d ) Â   this calculation includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the cardmember loan portfolio , and thus is not representative of net interest yield on cardmember loans . the calculation includes interest income and interest expense attributable to investment securities and other interest-bearing deposits as well as to cardmember loans , and interest expense attributable to other activities , including cardmember receivables . Â   ( e ) Â   net interest yield on cardmember loans is a non-gaap financial measure that represents the net spread earned on cardmember loans . net interest yield on cardmember loans is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by adjusted average loans , computed on an annualized basis . the calculation of net interest yield on cardmember loans includes interest that is deemed uncollectible . for all presentations of net interest yield on cardmember loans , reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses Â — cardmember loans ; therefore , such reserves and net write-offs are not included in the net interest yield calculation . results of operations for the three and nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 and 2009international card services segment income increased 15 Â   percent or $ 20 Â   million to $ 153 Â   million for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2010 , from $ 133 Â   million

respectively . the increases are driven primarily by increases in discount revenue , net card fees and other , partially offset by a decrease in net interest income . discount revenue , net card fees and other revenues of $ 932 Â   million and $ 2 . 7 Â   billion for three and nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 increased $ 54 Â   million or 6 Â   percent and $ 176 Â   million or 7 percent , respectively , driven primarily by higher level of card spending and higher other commissions and fees . the 12 Â   percent and 14 Â   percent increase in billed business for the three and nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 , respectively , reflects a 15 Â   percent and 20 Â   percent increase in average spending per proprietary basic cards-in-force , partially offset by a 2 percent decrease in basic cards-in-force , when compared to the prior year . table of contents for the three and nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 , adjusting for the impacts of foreign exchange translation , billed business increased 10 Â   percent and 8 Â   percent , respectively , and average spending per proprietary basic cards-in-force increased 13 Â   percent and 14 Â   percent , respectively .

compared to the same period a year ago , driven by a lower yield on cardmember loans and a lower average loan balance , partially offset by higher lending card fees . interest expense was flat and decreased $ 4 Â   million or 1 Â   percent for the three and nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 , due to a lower average loan balance , partially offset by a higher average receivable balance . provisions for losses of $ 64 Â   million and $ 312 Â   million decreased $ 186 Â   million or 74 Â   percent and $ 575 million or 65 Â   percent for the three and nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 , respectively , primarily reflecting improving cardmember loan and charge card credit trends . expenses of $ 960 Â   million and $ 2 . 6 Â   billion increased $ 189 Â   million or 25 Â   percent and $ 383 Â   million or 17 Â   percent for the three and nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 , respectively , due to higher marketing , promotion , rewards and cardmember services expenses and salaries , employee benefits and other operating expenses . marketing , promotion , rewards and cardmember services expenses of $ 428 Â   million and $ 1 . 2 Â   billion for the three and nine months ended september Â   30 , 2010 , respectively , increased $ 126 Â   million or 42 percent and $ 307 Â   million or 36 Â   percent as compared to the same periods a year ago , reflecting higher marketing and promotion expenses and greater volume-related rewards costs . salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased $ 63 Â   million or 13 Â   percent to $ 532 Â   million for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2010 reflecting higher technology-related investments . salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased $ 76 Â   million or

salaries and employee benefits . the effective tax rate was ( 6 ) Â   percent and 13 Â   percent for the three and nine months ended september 30 , 2010 , respectively . the effective tax rate was 2 Â   percent and ( 11 ) Â   percent for the three and nine months ended september Â   30 , 2009 , respectively . the tax rate for the three months ended september Â   30 , 2010 reflects a benefit from the resolution of certain prior year tax items . the tax rates in all periods reflect the impact of recurring tax benefits on varying levels of pretax income . as indicated in previous quarters , this segment reflects the favorable impact of the company Â ’ s consolidated tax benefit related to its ongoing funding activities outside the united states , which is allocated to international card services under the company Â ’ s internal tax allocation process . the availability of this benefit in future years is largely dependent on a provision of the u . s . internal revenue code that congress has not yet acted to extend . refer to certain legislative , regulatory and other developments above for further discussion of this provision . table of contents global commercial services Â

Â   43 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â — ( continued ) Â   during the nine months ended june Â   30 , 2012 , the company repurchased 53 Â   million shares of its common stock for $ 2 , 042 million . as of june Â   30 , 2012 , the company had remaining authorization in place to repurchase 251 Â   million additional shares . the repurchase program does not have an expiration date . we believe that the company Â ’ s financial condition is strong and that its cash balances , other liquid assets , operating cash flows , access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity , taken together , provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects . however , the company Â ’ s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control . in addition to macroeconomic factors , the company Â ’ s borrowing costs can be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies , which are based , in significant part , on the company Â ’ s performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios . as of june Â   30 , 2012 , moody Â ’ s investors service Â ’ s long- and short-term debt ratings for the company were a2 and p-1 , respectively , with stable outlook ; standard Â   & poor Â ’ s long- and short-term debt ratings for the company were a and a-1 , respectively , with stable outlook ; and fitch Â ’ s long- and short-term debt ratings for the company were a and f-1 , respectively , with stable outlook . the company Â ’ s bank facilities contain only one financial covenant , relating to interest coverage , which the company met on june Â   30 , 2012 , by a significant margin . the company Â ’ s bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities , such as disneyland paris , hong kong disneyland resort and shanghai disney resort , from any representations , covenants or events of default . disneyland paris Â ’ debt agreements contain annual financial performance objectives and limits on investing and financing activities . in fiscal 2011 , disneyland paris did not meet its annual performance objectives and deferred Â € 25 Â   million of royalties and management fees payable to the company and Â € 20 Â   million of interest payable to a french state bank . additionally , as a result of the fact that the performance objectives were not met , certain of disneyland paris Â ’ investment activities were further limited by the debt agreements . disneyland paris is also subject to certain financial covenants and was in compliance with such covenants for fiscal year 2011 with the assistance of the company Â ’ s agreement , as permitted under the debt agreements , to defer an additional Â € 9 Â   million of royalties payable to the company into subordinated long-term borrowings . on january Â   6 , 2012 , disneyland paris obtained its lenders Â ’ agreement to increase the recurring annual investment budget for fiscal year 2012 up to Â € 100 Â   million and to launch a multi-year expansion of the walt disney studios park , which includes a new attraction . in connection with lenders Â ’ approval , disneyland paris obtained a standby revolving credit facility of Â € 150 Â   million from the company , which expires on september Â   30 , 2018 . the new facility is in addition to an existing Â € 100 Â   million facility provided by the company which expires on september Â   30 , 2014 . Â   44 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â — ( continued ) Â   commitments and contingencies legal matters as disclosed in note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements , the company has exposure for certain legal matters . guarantees see note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company Â ’ s guarantees . tax matters as disclosed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2011 annual report on form 10-k , the company has exposure for certain tax matters . contractual commitments refer to note 15 in the consolidated financial statements in the 2011 annual report on form 10-k for information regarding the company Â ’ s contractual commitments . other matters accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies , which are important to our financial position and results of operations , require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management . for a summary of our significant accounting policies , including the accounting policies discussed below , see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2011 annual report on form 10-k . film and television revenues and costs we expense film and television production , participation and residual costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period Â ’ s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues ( ultimate revenues ) for each production . if our estimate of ultimate revenues decreases , amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated . conversely , if our estimate of ultimate revenues increase , film and television cost amortization may be slowed . for film productions , ultimate revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial theatrical release . for television series , ultimate revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode , or if still in production , five years from delivery of the most recent episode , if later . with respect to films intended for theatrical release , the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues ( and therefore affecting future film cost amortization and / or impairment ) is domestic theatrical performance . revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the domestic theatrical release ( e . g . , the home entertainment or international theatrical markets ) have historically been highly correlated with domestic theatrical performance . domestic theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film , the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort . upon a film Â ’ s release and determination of domestic theatrical performance , the company Â ’ s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends . the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues for released films is the extent of home entertainment sales achieved . home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home video products , as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products . Â   45 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â — ( continued ) Â   with respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast , the most sensitive factor affecting estimates of ultimate revenues is the program Â ’ s rating and the strength of the advertising market . program ratings , which are an indication of market acceptance , directly affect the company Â ’ s ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program . in addition , television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the eventual sale of the program rights in the syndication , international and home entertainment markets . alternatively , poor ratings may result in a television series cancellation , which would require the immediate write-off of any unamortized production costs . a significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates . we expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired movies , series and other programs based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired or on a straight-line basis over the useful life , as appropriate . amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings . the number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the program Â ’ s ratings in previous airings , expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming . accordingly , planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary . we amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement . the estimated values of each year are based on our projection of revenues over the contract period which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue . if the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season Â ’ s relative value , we expense the related contractual payment during the applicable season . if planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly , amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed . costs of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs . the net realizable values of television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology . a daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type . the company Â ’ s dayparts are : daytime , late night , primetime , news , children , and sports ( includes network and cable ) . the net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable channel . individual programs are written-off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program . estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions . if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections , film , television and programming cost write-downs may be required . revenue recognition the company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business . see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2011 annual report on form 10-k for a summary of these revenue recognition policies . we reduce home entertainment and software product revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and for customer programs and sales incentives . these estimates are based upon historical return experience , current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products . if we underestimate the level of returns and concessions in a particular period , we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amount . conversely , if we overestimate the level of returns and concessions for a period , we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns and concessions are less than estimated . we recognize revenues from advance theme park ticket sales when the tickets are used . for non-expiring , multi-day tickets , we recognize revenue over a five-year time period based on estimated Â   46 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â — ( continued ) Â   usage , which is derived from historical usage patterns . if actual usage is different than our estimated usage , revenues may not be recognized in the periods the related services are rendered . in addition , a change in usage patterns would impact the timing of revenue recognition . pension and postretirement medical plan actuarial assumptions the company Â ’ s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions . two critical assumptions , the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets , are important elements of expense and / or liability measurement which we evaluate annually . refer to the 2011 annual report on form 10-k for estimated impacts of changes in these assumptions . other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns , mortality , turnover and rate of compensation increase . the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date . a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense . the guideline for setting this rate is high-quality long-term corporate bond rates . the company Â ’ s discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality corporate bonds . the resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves . to determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets , we consider the current and expected asset allocation , as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class . a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense . goodwill , intangible assets , long-lived assets and investments the company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require , on an interim basis . goodwill is allocated to various reporting units , which are generally an operating segment or one level below the operating segment . the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment . if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value , an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the goodwill . to determine the fair value of our reporting units , we generally use a present value technique ( discounted cash flow ) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate . Â   we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units . the discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses . we include in the projected cash flows an estimate of the revenue we believe the reporting unit would receive if the intellectual property developed by the reporting unit that is being used by other reporting units was licensed to an unrelated third party at its fair market value . these amounts are not necessarily the same as those included in segment operating results . we believe our estimates of fair value are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units . in times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy , the company Â ’ s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual . if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions , the impairment test results could differ , and we could be required to record impairment charges . the company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts . if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value , an impairment loss is recognized . fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values , as appropriate . Â   47 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â — ( continued ) Â   the company tests long-lived assets , including amortizable intangible assets , for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances ( triggering events ) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable . once a triggering event has occurred , the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale . the impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group against the carrying value of the asset group . an asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments . if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows , an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the group Â ’ s long-lived assets and the carrying value of the group Â ’ s long-lived assets . the impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts , but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value . for assets held for sale , to the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset Â ’ s fair value less costs to sell , an impairment loss is recognized for the difference . determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions , including whether a triggering event has occurred , the identification of the asset groups , estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values . if we had established different asset groups or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions , the impairment test results could differ , and we could be required to record impairment charges . the company has cost and equity investments . the fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies , as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments . in assessing potential impairment of these investments , we consider these factors , as well as the forecasted financial performance of the investees and market values , where available . if these forecasts are not met or market values indicate an other-than-temporary decline in value , impairment charges may be required . allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business . in times of domestic or global economic turmoil , our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods . if our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low , costs and expenses may increase in future periods , and if it is too high , costs and expenses may decrease in future periods . contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and , as required , have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims . these estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results , assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies . it is possible , however , that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings . see note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information on litigation exposure . income tax audits as a matter of course , the company is regularly audited by federal , state and foreign tax authorities . Â   from time to time , these audits result in proposed assessments . Â   our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal Â   48 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â — ( continued ) Â   counsel where appropriate and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings ( or negotiations ) with taxing and legal authorities . the tax benefits ultimately realized by the company may differ from those recognized in our financial statements based on a number of factors , including the company Â ’ s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter , relevant legal precedents related to similar matters and the company Â ’ s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities . market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes , foreign currency fluctuations , commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments . policies and procedures in the normal course of business , we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company Â ’ s exposure to changes in interest rates , foreign currencies , commodities , and the fair market value of certain investments in debt and equity securities using a variety of financial instruments . our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs . to achieve these objectives , we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company Â ’ s portfolio of borrowings . by policy , the company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages . our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges . accordingly , the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the u . s . dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets , liabilities , commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses . the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable , but not firmly committed , transactions . the company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities . the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro , british pound , japanese yen and canadian dollar . cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to u . s . dollar denominated borrowings . by policy , the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years . the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the u . s . dollar equivalent value of the related exposures . the economic or political conditions in a country could reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country . our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes . the amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities , such as fuel oil and gasoline . it is the company Â ’ s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above . the company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes .

Â   20 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations -- ( continued ) Â   the company recorded $ 6 million of restructuring and impairment charges in the current quarter . in the prior-year quarter , the company recorded $ 12 million of restructuring and impairment charges and gains on the sale of miramax and bass totaling $ 75 million . the table below shows the pretax and after tax impact of the prior year items .

Â   33 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations -- ( continued ) Â   on november Â   30 , 2011 , the company declared a $ 0 . 60 per share dividend ( $ 1 . 1 billion ) related to fiscal 2011 for shareholders of record on december Â   16 , 2011 , which was paid on january Â   18 , 2012 . the company paid a $ 0 . 40 per share dividend ( $ 756 million ) during the second quarter of fiscal 2011 related to fiscal 2010 . during the quarter ended december Â   31 , 2011 , the company repurchased 23 Â   million shares of its common stock for $ 800 million . as of december Â   31 , 2011 , the company had remaining authorization in place to repurchase 282 Â   million additional shares . the repurchase program does not have an expiration date . we believe that the company Â ’ s financial condition is strong and that its cash balances , other liquid assets , operating cash flows , access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity , taken together , provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects . however , the company Â ’ s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control . in addition to macroeconomic factors , the company Â ’ s borrowing costs can be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies , which are based , in significant part , on the company Â ’ s performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios . as of december Â   31 , 2011 , moody Â ’ s investors service Â ’ s long- and short-term debt ratings for the company were a2 and p-1 , respectively , with stable outlook ; standard Â   & poor Â ’ s long- and short-term debt ratings for the company were a and a-1 , respectively , with stable outlook ; and fitch Â ’ s long- and short-term debt ratings for the company were a and f-1 , respectively , with stable outlook . the company Â ’ s bank facilities contain only one financial covenant , relating to interest coverage , which the company met on december Â   31 , 2011 , by a significant margin . the company Â ’ s bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities , such as disneyland paris , hong kong disneyland and shanghai disney resort , from any representations , covenants or events of default . disneyland paris has in its debt agreements certain annual financial performance objectives and limits on investing and financing activities . in fiscal 2011 , disneyland paris did not meet its annual performance objectives and deferred Â € 25 Â   million of royalties and management fees payable to the company and Â € 20 Â   million of interest payable to a french state bank . additionally , as a result of the fact that the performance objectives were not met , certain of disneyland paris Â ’ s investment activities were further limited by the debt agreements . disneyland paris is also subject to certain financial covenants and was in compliance with such covenants with the assistance of the company Â ’ s agreement , as permitted under the debt agreements , to defer an additional â ‚ ¬ 9 million of royalties payable to the company into subordinated long-term borrowings . on january Â   6 , 2012 , disneyland paris obtained its lenders Â ’ agreement to increase the recurring annual investment budget for fiscal year 2012 up to Â € 100 Â   million and to launch a multi-year expansion of the walt disney studios park , which includes a new attraction . in connection with lenders Â ’ approval , disneyland paris obtained a standby revolving credit facility of Â € 150 Â   million from the company , which expires on september Â   30 , 2018 . the new facility is in addition to an existing â ‚ ¬ 100 million facility provided by the company which expires on september 30 , 2014 . Â   Â   34 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations -- ( continued ) Â   commitments and contingencies legal matters as disclosed in note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements , the company has exposure for certain legal matters . guarantees see note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company Â ’ s guarantees . tax matters as disclosed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2011 annual report on form 10-k , the company has exposure for certain tax matters . contractual commitments refer to note 15 in the consolidated financial statements in the 2011 annual report on form 10-k for information regarding the company Â ’ s contractual commitments . other matters accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies , which are important to our financial position and results of operations , require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management . for a summary of our significant accounting policies , including the accounting policies discussed below , see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2011 annual report on form 10-k . film and television revenues and costs we expense film and television production , participation and residual costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period Â ’ s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues ( ultimate revenues ) for each production . if our estimate of ultimate revenues decreases , amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated . conversely , if our estimate of ultimate revenues increase , film and television cost amortization may be slowed . for film productions , ultimate revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial theatrical release . for television series , ultimate revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode , or if still in production , five years from delivery of the most recent episode , if later . with respect to films intended for theatrical release , the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues ( and therefore affecting future film cost amortization and / or impairment ) is domestic theatrical performance . revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the domestic theatrical release ( e . g . , the home entertainment or international theatrical markets ) have historically been highly correlated with domestic theatrical performance . domestic theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film , the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort . upon a film Â ’ s release and determination of domestic theatrical performance , the company Â ’ s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends . the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues for released films is the extent of home entertainment sales achieved . home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home video products , as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products . Â   35 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations -- ( continued ) Â   with respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast , the most sensitive factor affecting estimates of ultimate revenues is the program Â ’ s rating and the strength of the advertising market . program ratings , which are an indication of market acceptance , directly affect the company Â ’ s ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program . in addition , television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the eventual sale of the program rights in the syndication , international and home entertainment markets . alternatively , poor ratings may result in a television series cancellation , which would require the immediate write-off of any unamortized production costs . a significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates . we expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired movies , series and other programs based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired or on a straight-line basis over the useful life , as appropriate . amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings . the number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the program Â ’ s ratings in previous airings , expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming . accordingly , planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary . we amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement . the estimated values of each year are based on our projection of revenues over the contract period which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue . if the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season Â ’ s relative value , we expense the related contractual payment during the applicable season . if planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly , amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed . costs of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs . the net realizable values of television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology . a daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type . the company Â ’ s dayparts are : daytime , late night , primetime , news , children , and sports ( includes network and cable ) . the net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable channel . individual programs are written-off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program . estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions . if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections , film , television and programming cost write-downs may be required . revenue recognition the company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business . see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2011 annual report on form 10-k as for a summary of these revenue recognition policies . we reduce home entertainment and software product revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and for customer programs and sales incentives . these estimates are based upon historical return experience , current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products . if we underestimate the level of returns and concessions in a particular period , we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amount . conversely , if we overestimate the level of returns and concessions for a period , we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns and concessions are less than estimated . Â   36 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations -- ( continued ) Â   we recognize revenues from advance theme park ticket sales when the tickets are used . for non-expiring , multi-day tickets , we recognize revenue over a four-year time period based on estimated usage , which is derived from historical usage patterns . if actual usage is different than our estimated usage , revenues may not be recognized in the periods the related services are rendered . in addition , a change in usage patterns would impact the timing of revenue recognition . pension and postretirement medical plan actuarial assumptions the company Â ’ s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions . two critical assumptions , the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets , are important elements of expense and / or liability measurement which we evaluate annually . refer to the 2011 annual report on form 10-k for estimated impacts of changes in these assumptions . other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns , mortality , turnover and rate of compensation increase . the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date . a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense . the guideline for setting this rate is high-quality long-term corporate bond rates . the company Â ’ s discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality corporate bonds . the resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves . to determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets , we consider the current and expected asset allocation , as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class . a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense . goodwill , intangible assets , long-lived assets and investments the company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require , on an interim basis . goodwill is allocated to various reporting units , which are generally an operating segment or one level below the operating segment . the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment . if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value , an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the goodwill . to determine the fair value of our reporting units , we generally use a present value technique ( discounted cash flow ) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate . Â   we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units . the discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses . we include in the projected cash flows an estimate of the revenue we believe the reporting unit would receive if the intellectual property developed by the reporting unit that is being used by other reporting units was licensed to an unrelated third party at its fair market value . these amounts are not necessarily the same as those included in segment operating results . we believe our estimates of fair value are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units . in times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy , the company Â ’ s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual . if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions , the impairment test results could differ , and we could be required to record impairment charges . Â   37 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations -- ( continued ) Â   the company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts . if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value , an impairment loss is recognized . fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values , as appropriate . the company tests long-lived assets , including amortizable intangible assets , for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances ( triggering events ) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable . once a triggering event has occurred , the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale . the impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group against the carrying value of the asset group . an asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments . if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows , an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the group Â ’ s long-lived assets and the carrying value of the group Â ’ s long-lived assets . the impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts , but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value . for assets held for sale , to the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset Â ’ s fair value less costs to sell , an impairment loss is recognized for the difference . determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions , including whether a triggering event has occurred , the identification of the asset groups , estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values . if we had established different asset groups or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions , the impairment test results could differ , and we could be required to record impairment charges . the company has cost and equity investments . the fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies , as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments . in assessing potential impairment of these investments , we consider these factors , as well as the forecasted financial performance of the investees and market values , where available . if these forecasts are not met or market values indicate an other-than-temporary decline in value , impairment charges may be required . allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business . in times of domestic or global economic turmoil , our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods . if our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low , costs and expenses may increase in future periods , and if it is too high , cost and expenses may decrease in future periods . contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and , as required , have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims . these estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results , assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies . it is possible , however , that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings . see note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information on litigation exposure . Â   38 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations -- ( continued ) Â   income tax audits as a matter of course , the company is regularly audited by federal , state and foreign tax authorities . Â   from time to time , these audits result in proposed assessments . Â   our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel where appropriate and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings ( or negotiations ) with taxing and legal authorities . the tax benefits ultimately realized by the company may differ from those recognized in our financial statements based on a number of factors , including the company Â ’ s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter , relevant legal precedents related to similar matters and the company Â ’ s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities . market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes , foreign currency fluctuations , commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments . policies and procedures in the normal course of business , we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company Â ’ s exposure to changes in interest rates , foreign currencies , commodities , and the fair market value of certain investments in debt and equity securities using a variety of financial instruments . our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs . to achieve these objectives , we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company Â ’ s portfolio of borrowings . by policy , the company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages . our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges . accordingly , the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the u . s . dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets , liabilities , commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses . the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable , but not firmly committed , transactions . the company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities . the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro , british pound , japanese yen and canadian dollar . cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to u . s . dollar denominated borrowings . by policy , the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years . the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the u . s . dollar equivalent value of the related exposures . our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes . the amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities , such as fuel oil and gasoline . it is the company Â ’ s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above . the company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes .

restructuring and impairment charges and a gain on the sale of an investment in two pay television services in latin america which together had a $ 0 . 07 negative impact on eps . seasonality the company Â ’ s businesses are subject to the effects of seasonality . consequently , the operating results for the quarter and six months ended april Â   3 , 2010 for each business segment , and for the company as a whole , are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year . media networks revenues are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels . in general , advertising revenues are somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months . affiliate revenues are typically collected ratably throughout the year . certain affiliate revenues at espn are deferred until annual programming commitments are met , and these commitments are typically satisfied during the second half of the company Â ’ s fiscal year which generally results in higher revenue recognition during that period . parks and resorts revenues fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities . peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods . studio entertainment revenues fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical , home entertainment , and television markets . release dates are determined by several factors , including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods . consumer products revenues are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior , which generally results in increased revenues during the company Â ’ s first fiscal quarter , and by the timing and performance of theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts . Â   23 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â – ( continued ) Â   interactive media revenues fluctuate due to the timing and performance of video game releases which are determined by several factors , including theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts , competition and the timing of holiday periods . revenues from certain of our internet and mobile operations are subject to similar seasonal trends . business segment results the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment operating income ,

Â   39 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â – ( continued ) Â   with respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast , the most sensitive factor affecting estimates of ultimate revenues is the program Â ’ s rating and the strength of the advertising market . program ratings , which are an indication of market acceptance , directly affect the company Â ’ s ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program . in addition , television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the eventual sale of the program rights in the syndication , international and home entertainment markets . alternatively , poor ratings may result in a television series cancellation , which would require the immediate write-off of any unamortized production costs . a significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates . we expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired movies , series and other programs based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired or on a straight-line basis over the useful life , as appropriate . amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings . the number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the program Â ’ s ratings in previous airings , expected advertising rates , and availability and quality of alternative programming . accordingly , planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary . rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements are amortized during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement . the estimated values of each year are based on our projection of revenues over the contract period which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue . if the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season Â ’ s relative value , we expense the related contractual payment during the applicable season . if planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly , amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed . costs of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs . the net realizable value of the television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology . a daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type . the company Â ’ s dayparts are : early morning , daytime , late night , primetime , news , children , and sports ( includes network and cable ) . the net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable channel . individual programs are written-off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program . estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions . if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections , film , television and programming cost write-downs may be required . revenue recognition the company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business . see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2009 annual report on form 10-k as amended on Â   form Â   8-k dated february Â   18 , 2010 for a summary of these revenue recognition policies . we reduce home entertainment and software product revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and for customer programs and sales incentives . these estimates are based upon historical return experience , current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products . if we underestimate the level of returns and concessions in a particular period , we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amount . conversely , if we overestimate the level of returns and concessions for a period , we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns and concessions are less than estimated . Â   40 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â – ( continued ) Â   revenues from advance theme park ticket sales are recognized when the tickets are used . for non-expiring , multi-day tickets , we recognize revenue over a three-year time period based on estimated usage , which is derived from historical usage patterns . if actual usage is different than our estimated usage , revenues may not be recognized in the periods the related services are rendered . in addition , a change in usage patterns would impact the timing of revenue recognition . pension and postretirement medical plan actuarial assumptions the company Â ’ s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions . two critical assumptions , the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets , are important elements of expense and / or liability measurement which we evaluate annually . refer to the 2009 annual report on form 10-k as amended on form 8-k dated february Â   18 , 2010 for estimated impacts of changes in these assumptions . other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns , mortality , turnover and rate of compensation increase . the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date . a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense . the guideline for setting this rate is high-quality long-term corporate bond rates that are currently available . the company Â ’ s discount rate is determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality corporate bonds . the resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves . to determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets , we consider the current and expected asset allocation , as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class . a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense . goodwill , intangible assets and investments the company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if current events or circumstances require an interim impairment assessment . goodwill is allocated to various reporting units , which are generally an operating segment or one reporting level below the operating segment . the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment . if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value , an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its goodwill . to determine the fair value of our reporting units , we generally use a present value technique ( discounted cash flow ) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate . Â   we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units . the discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses . we include in the projected cash flows an estimate of the revenue we believe the reporting unit would receive if the intellectual property developed by the reporting unit that is being used by other reporting units was licensed to an unrelated third party at its fair market value . these amounts are not necessarily the same as those included in segment operating results . we believe our estimates of fair value are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units . Â   41 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â – ( continued ) Â   in times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy , the company Â ’ s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual . if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions , the impairment test results could differ , and we could be required to record impairment charges . because of the way the accounting rules work , a relatively modest reduction in our estimate of the fair value of our broadcasting reporting unit could result in a significant goodwill impairment charge . the company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts . if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value , an impairment loss is recognized . fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values , as appropriate . the company has cost and equity investments . the fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies , as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments . in assessing the potential impairment for these investments , we consider these factors , as well as the forecasted financial performance of our investees and market values , where available . if these forecasts are not met or market values indicate an other-than-temporary decline in value , impairment charges may be required . allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectibility of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business . in times of domestic or global economic turmoil , our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectibility of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods . if our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low , costs and expenses may increase in future periods , and if it is too high , cost and expenses may decrease in future periods . contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and , as required , have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims . these estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results , assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies . it is possible , however , that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings . see note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information on litigation exposure . Â   42 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â – ( continued ) Â   income tax audits as a matter of course , the company is regularly audited by federal , state and foreign tax authorities . Â   from time to time , these audits result in proposed assessments . Â   our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax liabilities and benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel where appropriate and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings ( or negotiations ) with taxing and legal authorities . the tax liabilities or benefits ultimately realized by the company may differ from those recognized in our financial statements based on a number of factors , including the company Â ’ s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter , relevant legal precedents related to similar matters and the company Â ’ s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities . stock option compensation expense compensation expense for stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial valuation model . the weighted average assumptions used in the binomial valuation model during the six months ended april Â   3 , 2010 were 32 % for the expected volatility , 1 . 4 for the expected exercise multiple ( the multiple of exercise price to grant price at which exercises are expected to occur on average ) and 3 % for the expected termination rate . although the initial fair value of stock options is not adjusted after the grant date , changes in the company Â ’ s assumptions may change the estimated fair value of and therefore , the expense related to future stock option grants . the assumptions that cause the greatest variation in fair value in the binomial valuation model are the assumed volatility and expected exercise multiple . increases or decreases in either the assumed volatility or expected exercise multiple will cause the binomial option value to increase or decrease , respectively . the volatility assumption considers both historical and implied volatility and may be impacted by the company Â ’ s performance as well as changes in economic and market conditions . the expected exercise multiple may be influenced by the company Â ’ s future stock performance , stock price volatility and employee turnover rate . refer to the 2009 annual report on form 10-k as amended on form 8-k dated february Â   18 , 2010 for estimated impacts of changes in these assumptions . new accounting pronouncements see note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements . market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes , foreign currency fluctuations , commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments . policies and procedures in the normal course of business , we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company Â ’ s exposure to changes in interest rates , foreign currencies , commodities , and the fair market value of certain investments in debt and equity securities using a variety of financial instruments . our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs . to achieve these objectives , we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company Â ’ s portfolio of borrowings . by policy , the company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages . Â   43 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â – ( continued ) Â   our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges . accordingly , the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the u . s . dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets , liabilities , commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues . the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable , but not firmly committed , transactions . the company also uses forward contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities . the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro , british pound , japanese yen and canadian dollar . cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to u . s . dollar denominated borrowings . by policy , the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed five years . the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the u . s . dollar equivalent value of the related exposures . our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes . the amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities , such as fuel oil and gasoline . it is the company Â ’ s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above . the company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes .

Â   21 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â   Â – Â   ( continued ) Â   the current quarter included restructuring and impairment charges and a gain on the sale of an interest in a television service in europe in the current quarter , which together had a net adverse impact of $ 0 . 03 per share . the prior-year quarter included a gain on the sale of our investment in two pay television services in latin america which resulted in a benefit of $ 0 . 04 per share . seasonality the company Â ’ s businesses are subject to the effects of seasonality . consequently , the operating results for the quarter ended january Â   2 , 2010 for each business segment , and for the company as a whole , are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year . media networks revenues are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels . in general , advertising revenues are somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months . affiliate revenues are typically collected ratably throughout the year . certain affiliate revenues at espn are deferred until annual programming commitments are met , and these commitments are typically satisfied during the second half of the company Â ’ s fiscal year which generally results in higher revenue recognition during that period . parks and resorts revenues fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities . peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods . studio entertainment revenues fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical , home entertainment , and television markets . release dates are determined by several factors , including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods . consumer products revenues are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior , which generally results in increased revenues during the company Â ’ s first fiscal quarter , and by the timing and performance of theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts . interactive media revenues fluctuate due to the timing and performance of video game releases which are determined by several factors , including theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts , competition and the timing of holiday periods . revenues from certain of our internet and mobile operations are subject to similar seasonal trends .

million , to $ 4 . 2 billion , consisting of an 8 % increase , or $ 202 million , at the cable networks and a 5 % increase , or $ 70 million , at broadcasting . increased cable networks revenues were primarily due to growth of $ 172 million from affiliate fees and $ 54 million from advertising revenues . the increase in affiliate fees was primarily due to increases at espn and , to a lesser extent , the worldwide disney channels . the increase at espn was primarily due to higher contractual rates and subscriber growth , including growth from the launch of a new network in the united kingdom . the increase at the worldwide disney channels was due to subscriber growth internationally and contractual rate increases domestically . higher advertising revenue was due to an increase at espn driven by higher units sold , partially offset by lower rates .

Â   32 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â   Â – Â   ( continued ) Â   commitments and contingencies guarantees see note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company Â ’ s guarantees . tax matters as disclosed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2009 annual report on form 10-k , the company has exposure for certain tax matters . contractual commitments refer to note 15 in the consolidated financial statements in the 2009 annual report on form 10-k for information regarding the company Â ’ s contractual commitments . other matters accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies , which are important to our financial position and results of operations , require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management . for a summary of our significant accounting policies , including the accounting policies discussed below , see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2009 annual report on form 10-k . film and television revenues and costs we expense film and television production , participation and residual costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period Â ’ s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues ( ultimate revenues ) for each production . if our estimate of ultimate revenues decreases , amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated . conversely , if estimates of ultimate revenues increase , film and television cost amortization may be slowed . for film productions , ultimate revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial theatrical release . for television series , we include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode , or if still in production , five years from delivery of the most recent episode , if later . with respect to films intended for theatrical release , the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues ( and therefore affecting future film cost amortization and / or impairment ) is domestic theatrical performance . revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the domestic theatrical release ( e . g . the home video or international theatrical markets ) have historically been highly correlated with domestic theatrical performance . domestic theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film , the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort . upon a film Â ’ s release and determination of domestic theatrical performance , the company Â ’ s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends . the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues for released films is the extent of home entertainment sales achieved . home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home video products as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products . with respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast , the most sensitive factor affecting estimates of ultimate revenues is the program Â ’ s rating and the strength of the advertising market . program ratings , which are an indication of market acceptance , directly affect the company Â ’ s ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program . in addition , television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the eventual sale of the program rights in the syndication , international and home entertainment markets . alternatively , poor ratings may result in a television series cancellation , which would require the immediate write-off of any unamortized production costs . a significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates . Â   33 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â   Â – Â   ( continued ) Â   we expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired movies , series and other programs based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired or on a straight-line basis over the useful life , as appropriate . amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings . the number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the program Â ’ s ratings in previous airings , expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming . accordingly , planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary . rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements are amortized during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement . the estimated values of each year are based on our projection of revenues over the contract period which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue . if the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season Â ’ s relative value , we expense the related contractual payment during the applicable season . if planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly , amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed . costs of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs . the net realizable value of the television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology . a daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type . the company Â ’ s dayparts are : early morning , daytime , late night , primetime , news , children , and sports ( includes network and cable ) . the net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable channel . individual programs are written-off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program . estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions . if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections , film , television and programming cost write-downs may be required . revenue recognition the company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate for the circumstances of each business . see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2009 annual report on form 10-k for a summary of these revenue recognition policies . we reduce home entertainment and software product revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and for customer programs and sales incentives . these estimates are based upon historical return experience , current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products . if we underestimate the level of returns and concessions in a particular period , we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amount . conversely , if we overestimate the level of returns and concessions for a period , we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns and concessions are less than estimated . revenues from advance theme park ticket sales are recognized when the tickets are used . for non-expiring , multi-day tickets , we recognize revenue over a three-year time period based on estimated usage , which is derived from historical usage patterns . if actual usage is different than our estimated usage , revenues may not be recognized in the periods the related services are rendered . in addition , a change in usage patterns would impact the timing of revenue recognition . Â   34 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â   Â – Â   ( continued ) Â   pension and postretirement medical plan actuarial assumptions the company Â ’ s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions . two critical assumptions , the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets , are important elements of expense and / or liability measurement which we evaluate annually . refer to the 2009 annual report on form 10-k for estimated impacts of changes in these assumptions . other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns , mortality , turnover and rate of compensation increase . the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date . a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense . the guideline for setting this rate is high-quality long-term corporate bond rates that are currently available . the company Â ’ s discount rate is determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality corporate bonds . the resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves . to determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets , we consider the current and expected asset allocation , as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class . a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense . goodwill , intangible assets and investments the company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if current events or circumstances require an interim impairment assessment . goodwill is allocated to various reporting units , which are generally an operating segment or one reporting level below the operating segment . the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment . if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value , an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its goodwill . to determine the fair value of our reporting units , we generally use a present value technique ( discounted cash flow ) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate . Â   we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units . the discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses . we include in the projected cash flows an estimate of the revenue we believe the reporting unit would receive if the intellectual property developed by the reporting unit that is being used by other reporting units was licensed to an unrelated third party at its fair market value . these amounts are not necessarily the same as those included in segment operating results . we believe our estimates of fair value are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units . in times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy , the company Â ’ s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual . if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions , the impairment test results could differ , and we could be required to record impairment charges . because of the way the accounting rules work , a relatively modest reduction in our estimate of the fair value of our broadcasting reporting unit could result in a significant goodwill impairment charge . Â   35 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â   Â – Â   ( continued ) Â   the company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts . if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value , an impairment loss is recognized . fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values , as appropriate . the company has cost and equity investments . the fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies , as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments . in assessing the potential impairment for these investments , we consider these factors , as well as the forecasted financial performance of our investees and market values , where available . if these forecasts are not met or market values indicate an other-than-temporary decline in value , impairment charges may be required . allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectibility of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business . in times of domestic or global economic turmoil , our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectibility of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods . if our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low , costs and expenses may increase in future periods , and if it is too high , cost and expenses may decrease in future periods . contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and , as required , have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims . these estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results , assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies . it is possible , however , that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings . see note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure . income tax audits as a matter of course , the company is regularly audited by federal , state and foreign tax authorities . Â   from time to time , these audits result in proposed assessments . Â   our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel where appropriate and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings ( or negotiations ) with taxing and legal authorities . the tax benefits ultimately realized by the company may differ from those recognized in our financial statements based on a number of factors , including the company Â ’ s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter , relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the company Â ’ s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities . stock option compensation expense compensation expense for stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial valuation model . the weighted average assumptions used in the binomial valuation model during the quarter ended january Â   2 , 2010 were 31 % for the expected volatility , 1 . 4 for the expected exercise multiple ( the multiple of exercise price to grant price at which exercises are expected to occur on average ) and 8 % for the expected termination rate . although the initial fair value of stock options is not adjusted after the grant date , changes in the company Â ’ s assumptions may change the estimated fair value of and therefore , the expense related to future stock option grants . the assumptions that cause the greatest variation in fair value in the binomial valuation model are the assumed volatility and expected exercise multiple . increases or decreases in either the assumed volatility or expected exercise multiple will cause the binomial option value to increase or decrease , respectively . Â   36 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â   Â – Â   ( continued ) Â   the volatility assumption considers both historical and implied volatility and may be impacted by the company Â ’ s performance as well as changes in economic and market conditions . the expected exercise multiple may be influenced by the company Â ’ s future stock performance , stock price volatility and employee turnover rate . refer to the 2009 annual report on form 10-k for estimated impacts of changes in these assumptions . new accounting pronouncements see note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements . market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes , foreign currency fluctuations , commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments . policies and procedures in the normal course of business , we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company Â ’ s exposure to changes in interest rates , foreign currencies , commodities , and the fair market value of certain investments in debt and equity securities using a variety of financial instruments . our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs . to achieve these objectives , we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company Â ’ s portfolio of borrowings . by policy , the company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages . our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges . accordingly , the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the u . s . dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets , liabilities , commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues . the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable , but not firmly committed , transactions . the company also uses forward contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities . the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro , british pound , japanese yen and canadian dollar . cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to u . s . dollar denominated borrowings . by policy , the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed five years . the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the u . s . dollar equivalent value of the related exposures . our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes . the amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities , such as fuel oil and gasoline . it is the company Â ’ s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above . the company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes .

Â   21 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â   Â – Â   ( continued ) Â   the current quarter results also included restructuring charges totaling $ 0 . 01 per share while the prior-year quarter included an accounting gain related to the acquisition of the disney stores north america , a gain on the sale of movies . com , and the favorable resolution of certain prior-year income tax matters , which collectively benefited eps by $ 0 . 04 . nine-month results diluted earnings per share decreased 31 % for the nine months primarily due to lower operating results driven by lower broadcast and cable advertising sales , a decline in worldwide sales of dvd units , decreased guest spending and volumes at our domestic parks and disneyland paris , and higher programming costs and a bad debt charge at our broadcasting businesses . these decreases were partially offset by contractual rate increases on affiliate fees , principally at espn . the current nine months included restructuring and impairment charges , partially offset by a gain on the sale of our investment in two pay television services in latin america . collectively , these two items adversely affected eps by a net $ 0 . 07 . the prior year nine months eps included the gains and tax benefits totaling $ 0 . 04 per share as discussed above . seasonality the company Â ’ s businesses are subject to the effects of seasonality . consequently , the operating results for the quarter and nine months ended june Â   27 , 2009 for each business segment , and for the company as a whole , are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year . media networks revenues are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels . in general , advertising revenues are somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months . affiliate revenues are typically collected ratably throughout the year . certain affiliate revenues at espn are deferred until annual programming commitments are met , and these commitments are typically satisfied during the second half of the company Â ’ s fiscal year which generally results in higher revenue recognition during that period . parks and resorts revenues fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities . peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods . studio entertainment revenues fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical , home entertainment , and television markets . release dates are determined by several factors , including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods . consumer products revenues are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior and by the timing and performance of theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts . interactive media revenues fluctuate due to the timing and performance of video game releases which are determined by several factors , including theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts , competition and the timing of holiday periods . revenues from our internet and mobile operations are not subject to significant seasonal trends .

Â   36 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â   Â – Â   ( continued ) Â   commitments and contingencies legal matters as disclosed in note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial statements , the company has exposure for certain legal matters . guarantees see note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company Â ’ s guarantees . tax matters as disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2008 annual report on form 10-k , the company has exposure for certain tax matters . contractual commitments refer to note 14 in the consolidated financial statements in the 2008 annual report on form 10-k for information regarding the company Â ’ s contractual commitments . other matters accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies , which are important to our financial position and results of operations , require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management . for a summary of our significant accounting policies , including the accounting policies discussed below , see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2008 annual report on form 10-k as supplemented on form 8-k dated february Â   3 , 2009 . film and television revenues and costs we expense film and television production and participation costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period Â ’ s gross revenues to the estimated remaining total gross revenues ( ultimate revenues ) for each production . if our estimate of ultimate revenues decreases , amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated . conversely , if estimates of ultimate revenues increase , film and television cost amortization may be slowed . for film productions , ultimate revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years of the date of the initial theatrical release . for television series , we include revenues that will be earned within ten years of the delivery of the first episode , or if still in production , five years from the date of delivery of the most recent episode , if later . with respect to films intended for theatrical release , the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues ( and therefore affecting future film cost amortization and / or impairment ) is domestic theatrical performance . revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the domestic theatrical release ( e . g . the home video or international theatrical markets ) have historically been highly correlated with domestic theatrical performance . domestic theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film , the quality of competing films at the time of release , as well as the level of marketing effort . upon a film Â ’ s release and determination of domestic theatrical performance , the company Â ’ s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends . the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues for released films is the extent of home entertainment sales achieved . home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home video products as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products . Â   37 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â   Â – Â   ( continued ) Â   with respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast , the most sensitive factors affecting estimates of ultimate revenues is the program Â ’ s rating and the strength of the advertising market . program ratings , which are an indication of market acceptance , directly affect the company Â ’ s ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program . in addition , television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the eventual sale of the program rights in the syndication , international and home entertainment markets . alternatively , poor ratings may result in a television series cancellation , which would require the immediate write-off of any unamortized production costs . a significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates . we expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired movies , series and other programs based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired or on a straight-line basis over the useful life , as appropriate . amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings . the number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the program Â ’ s ratings in previous airings , expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming . accordingly , planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary . rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period Â ’ s gross revenues to ultimate revenues ( the projected revenue method ) or on a straight-line basis over the contract period , as appropriate . gross revenues include both advertising revenues and an allocation of affiliate fees . if the annual contractual payments related to each season over the term of a multi-year sports programming arrangement approximate each season Â ’ s rights cost based on the projected revenue method , we expense the related annual payments during the applicable season . if ultimate revenues change significantly from projections , amortization of the rights costs may be accelerated or slowed . costs of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs . the net realizable value of the television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology . a daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type . the company Â ’ s dayparts are : early morning , daytime , late night , primetime , news , children , and sports ( includes network and cable ) . the net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable channel . individual programs are written-off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program . estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions . if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections , film , television and programming cost write-downs may be required . revenue recognition the company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business . see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2008 annual report on form 10-k as supplemented on form 8-k dated february Â   3 , 2009 for a summary of these revenue recognition policies . we record reductions to home entertainment and software product revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and for customer programs and sales incentives . these estimates are based upon historical return experience , current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products . if we underestimate the level of returns and concessions in a particular period , we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amount . conversely , if we overestimate the level of returns and concessions for a period , we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns and concessions are less than estimated . Â   38 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â   Â – Â   ( continued ) Â   revenues from advance theme park ticket sales are recognized when the tickets are used . for non-expiring , multi-day tickets , we recognize revenue over a three-year time period based on estimated usage , which is derived from historical usage patterns . if actual usage is slower or faster than our estimated usage , revenues may not be recognized in the periods the related services are rendered . in addition , a change in usage patterns would impact the timing of revenue recognition . pension and postretirement medical plan actuarial assumptions the company Â ’ s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions . two critical assumptions , the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets , are important elements of expense and / or liability measurement which we evaluate annually . refer to the 2008 annual report on form 10-k for estimated impacts of changes in these assumptions . other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns , mortality , turnover and rate of compensation increase . the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date . a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense . the guideline for setting this rate is high-quality long-term corporate bond rates that are currently available . the company Â ’ s discount rate is determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality corporate bonds . the resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves . to determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets , we consider the current and expected asset allocation , as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class . a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense . goodwill , intangible assets and investments the company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if current events or circumstances require an interim impairment assessment . goodwill is allocated to various reporting units , which are generally one reporting level below the operating segment . the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment . if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value , an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its goodwill . to determine the fair value of our reporting units , we generally use a present value technique ( discounted cash flow ) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate . Â   we applied what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units . the discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses . we include in the projected cash flows an estimate of the revenue we believe the reporting unit would receive if the intellectual property developed by the reporting unit that is being used by other reporting units was licensed to an unrelated third party at its fair market value . these amounts are not necessarily the same as those included in segment operating results . in light of recent adverse economic conditions in the global economy , the company Â ’ s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual . if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions , the impairment test results could differ , and we could be required to record impairment charges . because of the way the accounting rules work , a relatively modest reduction in our estimate of the fair value of our broadcasting reporting unit could result in a significant goodwill impairment charge . the company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts . if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair Â   39 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â   Â – Â   ( continued ) Â   value , an impairment loss is recognized . fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values , as appropriate . the company has cost and equity investments . the fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies , as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments . in assessing potential impairment for these investments , we consider these factors as well as forecasted financial performance of our investees and market values , where available . if these forecasts are not met or market values indicate an other-than-temporary decline in value , impairment charges may be required . during the current year , the company evaluated the recoverability of certain intangible assets , investments and long-lived assets given the deterioration in the business climate and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $ 206 million including a $ 108 million write down of radio fcc licenses and a $ 49 million write-down of its investment in the utv group . the impairment charges related to the radio fcc licenses reflected overall market declines in the radio markets in which we operate . see note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impairment charge related to the utv group . allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectibility of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business . in light of the recent turmoil in the domestic and global economy that has affected many companies , our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectibility of our receivables from these companies have become subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods . if our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low , costs and expenses may increase in future periods and if it is too high , cost and expenses may decrease in future periods . contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and , as required , have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims . these estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results , assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies . it is possible , however , that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings . see note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure . income tax audits as a matter of course , the company is regularly audited by federal , state and foreign tax authorities . Â   from time to time , these audits result in proposed assessments . Â   our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel where appropriate and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings ( or negotiations ) with taxing and legal authorities . the tax benefits ultimately realized by the company may differ from those recognized in our financial statements based on a number of factors , including the company Â ’ s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter , relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the company Â ’ s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities . Â   40 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â   Â – Â   ( continued ) Â   stock option compensation expense compensation expense for stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial valuation model . the weighted average assumptions used in the binomial valuation model during the nine months ended june Â   27 , 2009 were 47 % for the expected volatility , 1 . 4 for the expected exercise multiple ( the multiple of exercise price to grant price at which exercises are expected to occur on average ) and 8 % for the expected termination rate . although the initial fair value of stock options is not adjusted after the grant date , changes in the company Â ’ s assumptions may change the estimated fair value of and therefore , the expense related to future stock option grants . the assumptions that cause the greatest variation in fair value in the binomial valuation model are the assumed volatility and expected exercise multiple . increases or decreases in either the assumed volatility or expected exercise multiple will cause the binomial option value to increase or decrease , respectively . the volatility assumption considers both historical and implied volatility and may be impacted by the company Â ’ s performance as well as changes in economic and market conditions . the expected exercise multiple may be influenced by the company Â ’ s future stock performance , stock price volatility and employee turnover rate . refer to the 2008 annual report on form 10-k for estimated impacts of changes in these assumptions . new accounting pronouncements see note 13 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements . market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes , foreign currency fluctuations , commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments . see notes 14 and 15 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information regarding the impact of derivative instruments on the company Â ’ s financial statements . policies and procedures in the normal course of business , we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company Â ’ s exposure to changes in interest rates , foreign currencies , commodities , and the fair market value of certain investments in debt and equity securities using a variety of financial instruments . our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs . to achieve these objectives , we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company Â ’ s portfolio of borrowings . by policy , the company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages . our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges . accordingly , the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the u . s . dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets , liabilities , commitments and forecasted foreign currency transactions . the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable , but not firmly committed , transactions . the company also uses forward contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities . the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro , british pound , japanese yen and canadian dollar . cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to u . s . dollar denominated borrowings . by policy , the company hedges its forecasted foreign Â   41 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Â   Â – Â   ( continued ) Â   currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed five years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure . the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the u . s . dollar equivalent value of the related exposures . our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes . the amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities , such as fuel oil and gasoline . it is the company Â ’ s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above . the company does not enter into these transactions or other hedging transactions for speculative purposes .

fiscal 2009 , we reported net earnings of $ 1 . 1 Â   billion and diluted earnings per share of $ 0 . 66 compared to net earnings of $ 1 . 2 Â   billion and diluted earnings per share of $ 0 . 71 for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 . for the first six months of fiscal 2009 , we reported net earnings of $ 1 . 6 Â   billion and diluted earnings per share of $ 0 . 96 compared to net earnings of $ 1 . 6 Â   billion and diluted earnings per share of $ 0 . 93 for the first six months of fiscal 2008 . our gross profit margin was 33 . 5 % and our operating margin was 9 . 6 % for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 . for the first six months of fiscal 2009 , our gross profit margin was 33 . 6 % and our operating margin was 8 . 0 % . the results for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2009 and 2008 reflect the impact of several strategic actions initiated in fiscal 2008 . these strategic actions include store rationalization charges related to the closing of 15 underperforming stores and the removal of approximately 50 stores from our new store opening pipeline , business rationalization charges related to the exit of our expo , thd design center , yardbirds and hd bath businesses ( the Â “ exited businesses Â ” ) and charges related to the restructuring of support functions ( collectively , the Â “ rationalization charges Â ” ) . these actions resulted in pretax rationalization charges of $ 20 Â   million and $ 18 Â   million for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 and 2008 , respectively , and $ 137 Â   million and $ 561 Â   million for the first six months of fiscal 2009 and 2008 , respectively . excluding these rationalization charges , diluted earnings per share were $ 0 . 67 for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to $ 0 . 72 for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 and were $ 1 . 01 for the first six months of fiscal 2009 compared to $ 1 . 13 for the first six months of fiscal 2008 . the results for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2009 also reflect a tax benefit of approximately $ 50 Â   million to net earnings arising from a favorable foreign tax settlement . this tax benefit positively impacted diluted earnings per share by approximately $ 0 . 03 for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2009 . table of contents net sales decreased 9 . 1 % to $ 19 . 1 Â   billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 from $ 21 . 0 Â   billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 . for the first six months of fiscal 2009 , net sales decreased 9 . 4 % to $ 35 . 2 Â   billion from $ 38 . 9 Â   billion for the first six months of fiscal 2008 . the slowdown in the global economy and weakness in the u . s . residential construction and home improvement markets negatively impacted our net sales for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2009 . our comparable store sales declined 8 . 5 % in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 driven by an 8 . 5 % decline in our comparable store average ticket to $ 52 . 23 . for our u . s . stores , comparable store sales declined 6 . 9 % and comparable store customer transactions increased by 0 . 4 % in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 . in the first six months of fiscal 2009 , we continued to focus on our core retail business , investing in our associates and stores and improving our customer service . the roll-out of our customer first training to all store associates and support staff in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 has brought simplification and focus across the business , and we are seeing the benefit of this in improved customer service ratings for the first six months of fiscal 2009 . we also made significant progress on our merchandising tools in the u . s . that helped us to better manage markdown and clearance activity and to better control inventory . at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2009 , our inventory had decreased by $ 1 . 1 Â   billion from the second quarter of fiscal 2008 . additionally , our average inventory per store decreased by 8 . 3 % at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to the second quarter of last year . we continued our supply chain transformation to improve product availability . as of august 18 , 2009 , we had eight rapid deployment centers ( Â “ rdcs Â ” ) operating that serve approximately 800 of our u . s . stores . we plan to open additional rdcs in fiscal 2009 and expect that they will serve approximately 1 , 000 of our u . s . stores by the end of fiscal 2009 . we remain committed to our overall rdc roll-out strategy , supporting our goal of increasing our central distribution penetration . we opened three new stores during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 and closed one store in china , bringing our total store count to 2 , 240 . as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2009 , a total of 266 stores , or approximately 12 % , were located in canada , mexico and china compared to 251 as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2008 . we generated $ 3 . 3 Â   billion of cash flow from operations in the first six months of fiscal 2009 . we used a portion of this cash flow to pay $ 762 Â   million of dividends and fund $ 353 Â   million in capital expenditures . at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2009 , our long-term debt-to-equity ratio was 50 . 4 % compared to 60 . 9 % at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2008 . our return on invested capital ( computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt , equity and net operating profit after tax for the trailing twelve months ) was 9 . 3 % for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to 10 . 7 % for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 . this decrease reflects the decline in our operating profit and the impact of the rationalization charges . excluding rationalization charges , our return on invested capital was 10 . 3 % for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to 11 . 6 % for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 . table of contents we

fiscal 2008 . total comparable store sales decreased 8 . 5 % for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to a decrease of 7 . 9 % for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 . for the first six months of fiscal 2009 , total comparable store sales decreased 9 . 3 % compared to a decrease of 7 . 2 % for the same period of fiscal 2008 . there were a number of factors that contributed to our comparable store sales decline . the u . s . residential construction and home improvement markets continued to be soft , and consumers were challenged due to a number of factors including higher unemployment . we saw relative strength in building materials , flooring , paint , plumbing and garden / seasonal as comparable store sales in these areas were above the company average for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2009 , with paint experiencing positive comparable store sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 . comparable store sales for lumber , hardware , electrical , kitchen / bath and millwork were below the company average for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2009 . in the first six months of fiscal 2009 , we also saw significant strengthening of the u . s . dollar against all currencies . fluctuating exchange rates negatively impacted our total company comparable store sales by approximately 160 basis points for the first six months of fiscal 2009 compared to the first six months of last year . gross profit decreased 8 . 3 % to $ 6 . 4 Â   billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 from $ 7 . 0 Â   billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 . gross profit decreased 9 . 2 % to $ 11 . 8 Â   billion for the first six months of fiscal 2009 from $ 13 . 0 Â   billion for the first six months of fiscal 2008 . gross profit as a percent of net sales increased 32 basis points to 33 . 5 % for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to 33 . 2 % for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 . for the first six months of fiscal 2009 , gross profit as a percent of net sales was 33 . 6 % compared with 33 . 5 % for the comparable period of fiscal 2008 , an increase of 8 basis points . our u . s . stores experienced gross margin expansion in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2009 driven by mix of products sold , lower markdowns than last year as we anniversaried certain promotions and clearance that we did not repeat and improved shrink performance . through our focused bay portfolio approach , our u . s . merchants continued to introduce new lower prices while growing overall gross margin . the u . s . gross margin expansion was partially offset by gross margin contraction arising from our non-u . s . businesses , principally canada . selling , general and administrative expense ( Â “ sg & a Â ” ) decreased 7 . 8 % to $ 4 . 1 Â   billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 from $ 4 . 5 Â   billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 . for the first six months of fiscal 2009 , sg & a decreased 12 . 9 % todepreciation and amortization decreased 4 . 0 % to $ 434 Â   million for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 from $ 452 Â   million for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 . for the first six months of fiscal 2009 , depreciation and amortization decreased 3 . 8 % to $ 862 Â   million from $ 896 Â   million for the same period of fiscal 2008 . depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 2 . 3 % for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to 2 . 2 % for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 , and was 2 . 4 % for the first six months of fiscal 2009 compared to 2 . 3 % for the same period in fiscal 2008 . the increase in depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales for both periods was primarily due to sales deleverage . operating income decreased 10 . 2 % to $ 1 . 8 Â   billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 from $ 2 . 0 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 . operating income was $ 2 . 8 Â   billion for the first six months of fiscal 2009 and 2008 . operating income as a percent of net sales was 9 . 6 % for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to 9 . 7 % for the second quarter of fiscal table of contents 2008 , and was 8 . 0 % for the first six months of fiscal 2009 compared to 7 . 1 % for the first six months of fiscal 2008 . excluding the rationalization charges , our operating income as a percent of net sales was 8 . 4 % for the first six months of fiscal 2009 compared to 8 . 6 % for the first six months of fiscal 2008 . in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 , we recognized $ 161 Â   million of net interest expense compared to $ 157 Â   million in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 . Â   we recognized $ 336 Â   million of net interest expense in the first six months of fiscal 2009 compared to $ 321 Â   million for the same period last year . net interest expense as a percentage of net sales was 0 . 8 % for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to 0 . 7 % for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 . for the first six months of fiscal 2009 , net interest expense as a percent of net sales was 1 . 0 % compared to 0 . 8 % for the same period last year . the increase in net interest expense as a percent of net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2009 was primarily due to sales deleverage . our combined effective income tax rate decreased to 34 . 2 % for the first six months of fiscal 2009 from 36 . 4 % for the comparable period of fiscal 2008 , reflecting a favorable foreign tax settlement . this settlement reduced tax expense by approximately $ 50 Â   million and provided an approximately $ 0 . 03 benefit to diluted earnings per share . diluted earnings per share were $ 0 . 66 and $ 0 . 96 for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2009 compared to $ 0 . 71 and $ 0 . 93 for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2008 , respectively . excluding the rationalization charges , diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 were $ 0 . 67 , a decrease of 6 . 9 % from the second quarter of fiscal 2008 . excluding the rationalization charges , diluted earnings per share for the first six months of fiscal 2009 were $ 1 . 01 , a decrease of 10 . 6 % from the first six months of fiscal 2008 . to provide clarity , internally and externally , about our operating performance for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2009 and 2008 , we supplemented our reporting with non-gaap financial measures to reflect adjustments for the rationalization charges as described more fully in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements , as well as the net sales from exited businesses during the period from closing announcement to actual closing . we believe that these non-gaap financial measures better enable management and investors to understand and analyze our performance by providing them with meaningful information relevant to events of unusual nature or frequency . however , this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures . the following reconciles the non-gaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap measures for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2009 and 2008 : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   three months ended august 2 , 2009 Â   six months ended august 2 , 2009amounts in millions , except per share data Â   as Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   non-gaap Â   Â   % of net Â   as Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   non-gaap Â   Â   % of Â   Â   reported Â   Â   adjustments Â   measures Â   Â   sales Â   reported Â   Â   adjustments Â   measures Â   Â   net salesnet sales Â   $ 19 , 071 Â   Â   $ -

$ 0 . 21 for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 . our gross profit margin was 33 . 7 % and our operating margin was 6 . 1 % for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to gross profit margin of 33 . 9

comparable store sales for our u . s . stores declined 8 . 6 % in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 . table of contents despite the continuing difficult economic environment in the first quarter of

out our new customer first training to all store associates and support staff in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 . this training has brought simplification and focus across the business , and we are seeing the benefit of this in improved customer service ratings . we also made significant progress on our merchandising tools in the u . s . that helped us manage markdown and clearance activity and better control inventory . at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2009 , our inventory had decreased by $ 1 . 2 Â   billion from the first quarter of fiscal 2008 . additionally , our average inventory per store decreased by 8 . 8 % at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to the first quarter of last year . we continued our supply chain transformation to improve product

first quarter of fiscal 2008 . our return on invested capital ( computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing twelve months ) was 10 . 0 % for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to 12 . 0 % for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 . this decrease reflects the decline in our operating profit , which includes the impact of the rationalization charges . excluding rationalization charges , our return on invested capital was 11 . 1 % for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to 13 . 0 % for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 . table of contents we

accordance with generally accepted accounting principles . table of contents results of operationsnet sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 decreased 9 . 7 % , or $ 1 . 7 Â   billion , to $ 16 . 2 Â   billion from $ 17 . 9 Â   billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 . the decrease in net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 reflects the impact of negative comparable store sales , partially offset by net sales of $ 220 Â   million from new stores . total comparable store sales decreased 10 . 2 % for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to a decrease of 6 . 5 % for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 . due to the 53rdthere were a number of factors that contributed to our comparable store sales decline . in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 , we saw significant strengthening of the u . s . dollar against all currencies . fluctuating exchange rates negatively impacted our total company comparable store sales by approximately 190 basis points compared to last year , partially offset by a 30 basis point benefit arising from comparable store sales growth outside of the u . s . the u . s . residential construction and home improvement markets continued to be soft , and consumers were challenged due to higher unemployment and an across-the-board tightening of consumer credit availability . we saw relative strength in building materials , flooring , paint , plumbing and garden / seasonal as comparable store sales in these areas were above the company average for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 . comparable store sales for lumber , hardware , electrical , kitchen / bath and millwork were below the company average for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 . softness in construction and discretionary categories as well as the stronger u . s . dollar negatively impacted average ticket , which decreased 8 . 2 % to $ 52 . 67 for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 . gross profit decreased 10 . 2 % to $ 5 . 5 Â   billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 from $ 6 . 1 Â   billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 . gross profit as a percent of net sales decreased 22 basis points to 33 . 7 % for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to 33 . 9 % for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 . our u . s . stores reported 29 basis points of gross margin expansion in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 driven by gross margin improvements in certain commodity classes , some shift in sales penetration and improved shrink performance . through our focused bay portfolio approach , our u . s . merchants continued to introduce new lower prices while growing overall gross margin . the u . s . gross profit margin expansion was offset by markdowns taken in connection with closing our exited businesses , which negatively impacted gross profit as a percent of net sales by 24 basis points . additionally , we realized 27 basis points of gross margin contraction arising from our non-u . s . businesses , principally canada . selling , general and administrative expense ( Â “ sg & a Â ” ) decreased 17 . 5 % to $ 4 . 0 Â   billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 from $ 4 . 9 Â   billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 . as a percent of net sales , sg & a was 25 . 0 % for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to 27 . 4 % for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 . excluding the rationalization charges , sg & a as a percent of net sales was 24 . 4 % , an increase of five basis points over the adjusted prior year period . this increase reflects expense deleverage in the negative comparable store sales environment , offset by a lower cost of credit associated with the private label credit card program and solid expense control . depreciation and amortization decreased 3 . 6 % to $ 428 Â   million for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 from $ 444 Â   million for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 . depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 2 . 6 % for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and 2 . 5 % for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 . excluding the rationalization charges , depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales increased by 18 basis points from last year , primarily due to sales deleverage . operating income increased 34 . 6 % to $ 980 Â   million for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 from $ 728 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 . operating income as a percent of net sales was 6 . 1 % for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to 4 . 1 % for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 . excluding the rationalization charges , our operating income as a percent of net sales was 6 . 9 % for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to 7 . 1 % for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 . in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 , we recognized $ 175 Â   million of net interest expense compared to $ 164 Â   million in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 . net interest expense as a percent of net sales was 1 . 1 % for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and 0 . 9 % for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 . the increase in net interest expense as a percent of net sales was primarily due to sales deleverage . our combined effective income tax rate decreased to 36 . 1 % for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 from 36 . 9 % for the comparable period of fiscal 2008 , reflecting lower foreign effective tax rates . table of contents diluted earnings per share were $ 0 . 30 for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to diluted earnings per share of $ 0 . 21 for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 . excluding the rationalization charges , diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 were $ 0 . 35 , a decrease of 14 . 6 % from the first quarter of fiscal 2008 . to provide clarity , internally and externally , about our operating performance in the first quarters of fiscal 2009 and 2008 , we supplemented our reporting with non-gaap measurements to reflect adjustments for the rationalization charges as described more fully in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements , as well as the net sales from exited businesses during the period from closing announcement to actual closing . this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measurements . we believe these non-gaap measurements provide management and investors with meaningful information to understand and analyze our performance . the following reconciles the non-gaap measurements to the reported gaap information for the first quarters of fiscal 2009 and 2008 : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â

fiscal 2009 , net cash provided by operating activities was $ 1 . 7 Â   billion compared to $ 2 . 1 Â   billion for the same period of fiscal 2008 . this change was primarily a result of changes in net working capital . net cash used in investing activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 was $ 83 Â   million compared to $ 438 Â   million for the same period of fiscal 2008 . the decrease was primarily the result of $ 277 million less in capital expenditures in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to the same period last year . net cash provided by financing activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 was $ 43 Â   million compared to net cash used in financing activities of $ 1 . 4 Â   billion for the same period of fiscal 2008 . this change was the result of $ 1 . 2 Â   billion in repayments of short-term borrowings in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 . we have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $ 3 . 25 Â   billion . in connection with the programs , we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $ 3 . 25 Â   billion . as of may Â   3 , 2009 , there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility . the credit facility , which expires in december Â   2010 , contains various restrictive covenants , with all of which we are in compliance . none of the covenants are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources . as of may Â   3 , 2009 , we had $ 2 . 2 Â   billion in cash and short-term investments . we believe that our current cash position , access to the debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years . in addition , we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing for other requirements . we intend to use cash flow generated by operations to repay the $ 1 . 8 Â   billion in debt coming due in fiscal 2009 . table of contents

quarter of 2011 , we completed the acquisitions of mcafee , inc . and the wireless solutions ( wls ) Â   business of infineon , which combined contributed approximately $ 500 Â   million to our first quarter revenue . our 2nd generation intel Â ® tmgross margin in the first quarter of 2011 declined 3 . 2 Â   percentage points compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 due to higher 22nm start-up costs , higher platform ( microprocessor and chipset ) unit costs , and the impact of the acquisitions . these impacts were partially offset by the benefit from higher platform average selling prices compared to the fourth quarter . the charges to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our intel Â ® Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) we began 2011 with great momentum and we expect to add to that momentum as we invest in developing new products for smartphones and tablets , such as the launch of the intel Â ® tmthe cash-generating power of our business was evident in the first quarter of 2011 with $ 4 . 0 billion of cash from operations . from a financial condition perspective , we ended the first quarter of 2011 with an investment portfolio of $ 11 . 5 Â   billion , consisting of cash and cash equivalents , short-term investments , and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets . during the first quarter of 2011 , net cash used for acquisitions was $ 8 . 2 Â   billion , we purchased $ 2 . 7 Â   billion in capital assets , repurchased $ 4 . 0 Â   billion of common stock through our common stock repurchase program , and returned $ 1 . 0 Â   billion to stockholders through dividends ( a per share increase of 15 % from the fourth quarter ) . strategyour goal is to be the preeminent computing solutions company that powers the worldwide digital economy . we believe that the proliferation of the internet and cloud computing have driven fundamental changes in the computing industry . we are transforming from a company with a primary focus on the design and manufacture of semiconductor chips for pcs and servers to a computing company that delivers complete solutions in the form of hardware and software platforms and supporting services . the number and variety of devices connected to the internet is growing , and computing is becoming an increasingly personal experience . end users value consistency across devices that connect seamlessly and effortlessly to the internet and to each other . we will help to enable this experience by innovating around three pillars of computing : energy-efficient performance , connectivity , and security . Â   Â • Â   energy-efficient performance . Â   Â • Â   connectivity . Â ® Â ® Â   Â • Â   security . to succeed in the changing computing environment , we have the following key objectives : Â   Â • Â   strive to ensure that intel technology remains the best choice for the pc as well as cloud computing and the data center . Â   Â • Â   expand platforms into adjacent market segments to bring compelling new solutions to the smartphone , the tablet , the tv , the car , and the embedded world . Â   Â • Â   enable devices that connect to the internet and to each other to create a continuum of personal computing . this continuum would give consumers a set of secure , consistent , and personalized computing experiences . Â   Â • Â   positively impact the world through our actions and the application of our energy-efficient technology . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) we will use our core assets to meet these objectives . our core assets include our silicon and process technology , our architecture and platforms , our global presence , our strong relationships across the industry , and our brand recognition . we believe that applying these core assets to our key focus areas provides us with the scale , capacity , and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to customers Â ’ needs quickly . some of our core assets and key focus areas are : Â   Â • Â   silicon and manufacturing technology leadership . Â   Â • Â   architecture and platforms . Â ® Â   Â • Â   software . Â ® tm Â   Â • Â   customer orientation . Â   Â • Â   strategic investments . Â   Â • Â   stewardship . our continued investment in developing our assets and execution on key focus areas will strengthen our competitive position as we enter and expand into new market segments . we believe that these new market segments will result in demand that is incremental to that of microprocessors designed for notebook and desktop computers . we also believe that increased internet traffic and use of cloud computing create a need for greater server infrastructure , including server products optimized for energy-efficient performance and virtualization . critical accounting estimatesthe methods , estimates , and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated condensed financial statements . some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments , often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain . our most critical accounting estimates include : Â   Â • Â   the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments , which impact gains ( losses ) Â   on equity method investments , net , or gains ( losses ) Â   on other equity investments , net when we record impairments ; Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   Â • Â   the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets ( property , plant and equipment ; goodwill ; and identified intangibles ) , which impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization ; Â   Â • Â   the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes ( including the measurement of uncertain tax positions ) , which impact our provision for taxes ; Â   Â • Â   the valuation of inventory , which impacts gross margin ; and Â   Â • Â   the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies , which impact gross margin or operating expenses when we recognize a loss contingency , revise the estimate for a loss contingency , or record an asset impairment . below , we discuss these policies further , as well as the estimates and judgments involved . non-marketable equity investmentswe regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies , which range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models . the carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio , excluding equity derivatives , totaled $ 2 . 7 Â   billion as of april Â   2 , 2011 ( $ 2 . 6 Â   billion as of december Â   25 , 2010 ) . the majority of this balance as of april 2 , 2011 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment . our flash memory market segment investments include our investment in im flash technologies , llc ( imft ) Â   and im flash singapore , llp ( imfs ) Â   of $ 1 . 4 Â   billion ( $ 1 . 5 Â   billion as of december Â   25 , 2010 ) . for further information , see Â “ note 10 : equity method and cost method investments Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q . our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using the cost method or the equity method of accounting , depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment . our non-marketable equity investments are classified within other long-term assets on the consolidated condensed balance sheets . non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky , and their success is dependent on product development , market acceptance , operational efficiency , other key business factors , and the ability of the investee companies to raise additional funds in financial markets that can be volatile . the companies could fail or not be able to raise additional funds when needed , or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than previous financings . these events could cause our investments to become impaired . in addition , financial market volatility could negatively affect our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings , mergers , and private sales . for further information about our investment portfolio risks , see Â “ risk factors Â ” in part Â   ii , item Â   1a of this form 10-q . we determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments quarterly for disclosure purposes ; however , the investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized . we determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using the market and income approaches . the market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies , such as projected revenues , earnings , and comparable performance multiples . the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors , including comparable companies Â ’ sizes , growth rates , industries , development stages , and other relevant factors . the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model , which may include one or multiple discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates for the investee : revenue , based on assumed market segment size and assumed market segment share ; expenses , capital spending , and other costs ; and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies . estimates of market segment size , market segment share , expenses , capital spending , and other costs are developed using historical data and available market data . the valuation of our non-marketable equity investments also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets , recent financing activities by the investees , the investees Â ’ capital structure , and the terms of the investees Â ’ issued interests . for non-marketable equity investments , the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment , such as : Â   Â • Â   the investee Â ’ s revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business prospects ; Â   Â • Â   the technological feasibility of the investee Â ’ s products and technologies ; Â   Â • Â   the general market conditions in the investee Â ’ s industry or geographic area , including adverse regulatory or economic changes ; Â   Â • Â   factors related to the investee Â ’ s ability to remain in business , such as the investee Â ’ s liquidity , debt ratios , and the rate at which the investee is using its cash ; and Â   Â • Â   the investee Â ’ s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) if the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value , we determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis , which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal . if the investment is considered to be other than temporarily impaired , we write down the investment to its fair value . impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $ 14 Â   million in the first quarter of 2011 . over the past 12 quarters , including the first quarter of 2011 , impairments of non-marketable equity investments ranged from $ 11 Â   million to $ 896 Â   million per quarter . this range included impairments of $ 896 Â   million during the fourth quarter of 2008 , primarily related to a $ 762 Â   million impairment charge on our investment in clearwire communications , llc . imft / imfsimft and imfs are variable interest entities that are designed to manufacture and sell nand products to intel and micron technology , inc . at manufacturing cost . we determine the fair value of our investment in imft / imfs using the income approach based on a weighted average of multiple discounted cash flow scenarios of our nand solutions group business , which requires the use of unobservable inputs . unobservable inputs that require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments are the estimates for projected revenue and discount rate . changes in management estimates for these unobservable inputs have the most significant effect on the fair value determination . we have not had an other-than-temporary impairment of our investment in imft / imfs . long-lived assetsproperty , plant and equipmentwe assess property , plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable . factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations , significant negative industry or economic trends , and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets . we measure the recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows . if an asset grouping Â ’ s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows , the asset grouping is considered to be impaired . the impairment is measured by comparing the difference between the asset grouping Â ’ s carrying value and its fair value . property , plant and equipment is considered a non-financial asset and is recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized . impairments are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows . due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity , we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings . in addition , as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions , we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets , primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements . when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated , we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets Â ’ new , shorter useful lives . over the past 12 quarters , including the first quarter of 2011 , impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets ranged from $ 10 Â   million to $ 95 million per quarter . goodwillgoodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired . goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on relative fair value of the future benefit of the purchased operations to our existing business units as well as the acquired business unit . we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year , or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist , to determine if the carrying value of the recorded goodwill is impaired . our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to its carrying value . reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment , referred to as a component . our reporting units are consistent with the operating segments identified in Â “ note 25 : operating segment information Â ” in part Â   i , item Â   1 of this form 10-q . if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit , goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing . if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit , then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit Â ’ s goodwill . if the carrying value of a reporting unit Â ’ s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value , we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions . our impairment review process uses the income method to estimate the reporting unit Â ’ s fair value and is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the following reporting unit estimates : revenue , based on assumed market segment growth rates and intel Â ’ s assumed market segment share ; estimated costs ; and appropriate discount rates based on the reporting units Â ’ weighted average cost of capital as determined by considering the observable weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies . our estimates of market segment growth , our market segment share and costs are based on historical data , various internal estimates and a variety of external sources , and are developed as part of our routine long-range planning process . the same estimates are also used in planning for our long-term manufacturing and assembly and test capacity needs as part of our capital budgeting process and for both long-term and short-term business planning and forecasting . we test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data . in determining the carrying value of the reporting unit , we must include an allocation of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets because of the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and test capacity . this allocation is based on each reporting unit Â ’ s relative percentage utilization of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets . during the fourth quarter of each of the prior two fiscal years , we completed our annual impairment reviews and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in either of these years . identified intangibleswe make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist . recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate . we review indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment quarterly and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable . recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate . if it is determined that an individual asset is impaired , the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset . the assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective . they can be affected by various factors , including external factors such as industry and economic trends , and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines . based on our impairment reviews of our intangible assets , we have not recognized any impairment charges in 2011 or 2010 . income taxeswe must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement purposes . these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits , benefits , and deductions , and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes , as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions . significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period . we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets . if recovery is not likely , we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable . we believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated condensed balance sheets . however , should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets , our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely . recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by management Â ’ s plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments ; therefore , changes in management Â ’ s plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations . we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process . the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit , including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes , if any . if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit , the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 % likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement . it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts , as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes . we re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis . this evaluation is based on factors such as changes in facts or circumstances , changes in tax law , new audit activity , and effectively settled issues . determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment . such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision . inventorythe valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality . the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products . the estimate of future demand is compared to work-in-process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount , if any , of obsolete or excess inventory . as of april Â   2 , 2011 , we had total work-in-process inventory of $ 1 . 8 billion and total finished goods inventory of $ 1 . 7 Â   billion . the demand forecast is included in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions . product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base , the stage of the product life cycle of our products , consumer confidence , and customer acceptance of our products , as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost . if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly , we could be required to write off inventory , which would negatively impact our gross margin . in order to determine what costs can be included in the valuation of inventory , we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities , based on historical loadings compared to total available capacity . if the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level , a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory , and therefore would be recognized as cost of sales in that period , which would negatively impact our gross margin . we refer to these costs as excess capacity charges . over the past 12 quarters , excess capacity charges ranged from zero to $ 680 Â   million per quarter . loss contingencieswe are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings and asserted and potential claims , accruals related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product errata , as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments ( loss contingencies ) that arise in the ordinary course of business . an estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated based on the best information available at that time . a loss contingency is disclosed when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred . the outcomes of legal and administrative proceedings and claims , and the estimation of product warranties and asset impairments , are subject to significant uncertainty . significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable . with respect to estimating the losses associated with repairing and replacing parts in connection with product errata , we make judgments with respect to customer return rates , costs to repair or replace parts , and where the product is in our customer Â ’ s manufacturing process . at least quarterly , we review the status of each significant matter , and we may revise our estimates as additional information becomes available . these revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position .

Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) liquiditycash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity . as of april Â   2 , 2011 , cash and cash equivalents , short-term investments , and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets totaled $ 11 . 5 Â   billion ( $ 21 . 5 Â   billion as of december Â   25 , 2010 ) . the majority of the decrease from the fourth quarter of 2010 is due to the cash required to fund our acquisition of mcafee in the first quarter of 2011 . in addition to the $ 11 . 5 Â   billion , we have $ 2 . 7 Â   billion in loans receivable and other long-term investments that we include when assessing our investment portfolio . substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with a / a2 or better rated issuers , and a substantial majority of the issuers are rated aa- / aa3 or better . our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity . we have an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $ 3 . 0 Â   billion , including through the issuance of commercial paper . maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during the first quarter of 2011 were $ 200 Â   million , although no commercial paper remained outstanding as of april Â   2 , 2011 . our commercial paper was rated a-1 + by standard & poor Â ’ s and p-1 by moody Â ’ s as of april Â   2 , 2011 . we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec , pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt , equity , and other securities . we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet our business requirements for the next 12 Â   months , including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test ; working capital requirements ; and potential dividends , common stock repurchases , and acquisitions or strategic investments . fair value of financial instrumentswhen determining fair value , we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact , and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability . see Â “ note 4 : fair value Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q . credit risk is factored into the valuation of financial instruments that we measure and record at fair value on a recurring basis . when fair value is determined using pricing models , such as a discounted cash flow model , the issuer Â ’ s credit risk and / or intel Â ’ s credit risk is factored into the calculation of the fair value , as appropriate . marketable debt instrumentsas of april Â   2 , 2011 , our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 12 . 6 Â   billion of marketable debt instruments . of these instruments , $ 1 . 4 Â   billion was classified as level 1 , $ 10 . 8 Â   billion as level 2 , and $ 302 Â   million as level 3 . our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 was classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets . management judgment was required to determine the levels for the frequency of transactions that should be met for a market to be considered active . our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into consideration the number of days each individual instrument trades over a specified period . of the $ 10 . 8 Â   billion balance of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2 , approximately 40 % of the balance was classified as level 2 due to the usage of a discounted cash flow model and approximately 60 % due to the use of non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data . our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes . when observable market data is not available , we corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes using unobservable data , if available . equity securitiesas of april Â   2 , 2011 , our portfolio of assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 1 . 5 Â   billion of marketable equity securities . substantially all of these securities were classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets . our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period .

forward-looking statements . in addition , any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance , our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses , and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements . such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in the Â “ business outlook Â ” section ( see also Â “ risk factors Â ” in part Â   ii , item Â   1a of this form 10-q ) . our actual results may differ materially , and these forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures , mergers , acquisitions , or other business combinations , including our definitive agreements with mcafee , inc . and infineon technologies ag as discussed in Â “ note 14 : proposed acquisitions Â ” in the notes to the consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q ,

revenue despite softness in the consumer segments of mature markets . our record revenue coupled with record quarterly operating income helped us achieve operating income as a percent of revenue of 37 . 3 % , our highest in over ten years . this metric highlights the strength of our product lineup , strong execution from our factory network , and progress on improving our cost structure . our third quarter revenue of $ 11 . 1 Â   billion increased 3 % from the second quarter and 18 % from the third quarter of 2009 . we achieved record microprocessor unit sales in the third quarter on strength in corporate demand and emerging markets . microprocessor average selling prices remained flat from the second to the third quarter . our revenue growth from the second quarter was below average seasonal trends as a result of weakness in the consumer segments of europe and north america . we expect our revenue growth in the fourth quarter to continue below seasonal trends on continued weakness in the consumer segments of mature markets and a reduction in customer inventories in anticipation of the launch of 2nd Â ® tmour gross margin percentage for the third quarter declined slightly from the second quarter , primarily from inventory write-offs of 2nd Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) our Â “ tick-tock Â ” technology

the third quarter of 2010 with an investment portfolio of $ 20 . 3 Â   billion , consisting of cash and cash equivalents , short-term investments , and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets . we generated $ 3 . 6 Â   billion in cash from operations during the third quarter , purchased $ 1 . 4 Â   billion in capital assets , and returned $ 877 million to stockholders through dividends . in september , our board of directors declared a dividend of $ . 1575 per common share to be paid in december . during the third quarter , we announced definitive agreements to acquire mcafee , inc . , for approximately $ 7 . 68 Â   billion , and infineon Â ’ s wireless solutions ( wls ) Â   business from infineon technologies ag , for approximately $ 1 . 4 Â   billion . for further information , see Â “ note 14 : proposed acquisitions Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q . the transactions are subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions . on november Â   2 , 2010 , the ftc publicly announced the final approval to a settlement between intel and the ftc that fully resolves the ftc Â ’ s 2009 lawsuit against intel . strategyour goal is to be the preeminent computing solutions company that powers the worldwide digital economy . we believe that the proliferation of the internet and cloud computing have driven fundamental changes in the computing industry . we are transforming from a company with a primary focus on the design and manufacture of semiconductor chips for pcs and servers to a computing company that delivers complete solutions in the form of hardware and software platforms and supporting services . the number and variety of devices connected to the internet is increasing and computing is becoming an increasingly personal experience . end users value consistency across devices that connect seamlessly and effortlessly to the internet and to each other . we will enable this experience by innovating around three pillars of computing : energy efficient performance , security , and connectivity . Â   Â • Â   energy-efficient performance . Â   Â   Â • Â   internet connectivity . Â ® Â ® Â   Â   Â • Â   security . to succeed in the changing computing environment , we have the following key objectives : Â   Â • Â   strive to ensure that intel technology remains the best choice for the pc as well as cloud computing and the datacenter . Â   Â   Â • Â   expand platforms into adjacent market segments to bring new compelling solutions to the smartphone , the tablet , the tv , the car , and the rest of the embedded world . Â   Â   Â • Â   enable devices that connect to the internet and to each other to create a continuum of personal computing . this continuum would give consumers a set of secure , consistent and personalized computing experiences . Â   Â   Â • Â   positively impact the world through our actions and the application of our energy-efficient technology . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) we will use our core assets to meet these objectives . our core assets include our silicon and process technology , our architecture and platforms , our global presence , our strong relationships across the industry , and our brand recognition . we believe that applying these core assets to our key focus areas provides us with the scale , capacity , and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to customers Â ’ needs quickly . some of our core assets and key focus areas are : Â   Â • Â   silicon and manufacturing technology leadership . Â   Â   Â • Â   architecture and platforms . Â ® Â   Â   Â • Â   software . Â ® tm Â   Â   Â • Â   customer orientation . Â   Â   Â • Â   strategic investments . Â   Â   Â • Â   stewardship . our continued investment in developing our assets and execution on key focus areas will strengthen our competitive position as we enter and expand into these new market segments . we believe that these new market segments will result in demand that is incremental to that of microprocessors designed for notebook and desktop computers . we also believe that increased internet traffic and the increasing use of cloud computing creates a need for greater server infrastructure , including server products optimized for energy-efficient performance and virtualization . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) critical accounting estimatesthe methods , estimates , and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated condensed financial statements . some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments , often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain . our most critical accounting estimates include : Â   Â • Â   the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments , which impact gains ( losses ) Â   on equity method investments , net , or gains ( losses ) Â   on other equity investments , net when we record impairments ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets , which impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes ( including the measurement of uncertain tax positions ) , which impact our provision for taxes ; and Â   Â   Â • Â   the valuation of inventory , which impacts gross margin . below , we discuss these policies further , as well as the estimates and judgments involved . non-marketable equity investmentswe regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies , which range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models . the carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio , excluding equity derivatives , totaled $ 2 . 7 Â   billion as of september Â   25 , 2010 ( $ 3 . 4 Â   billion as of december Â   26 , 2009 ) . the majority of this balance as of september Â   25 , 2010 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment . our flash memory market segment investments include our investment in im flash technologies , llc ( imft ) Â   and im flash singapore , llp ( imfs ) Â   of $ 1 . 5 Â   billion ( $ 1 . 6 Â   billion as of december Â   26 , 2009 ) . for further information , see Â “ note 10 : equity method and cost method investments Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q . our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using the cost method or the equity method of accounting , depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment . our non-marketable equity investments are classified within other long-term assets on the consolidated condensed balance sheets . non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky , and their success is dependent on product development , market acceptance , operational efficiency , other key business factors , and the ability of the investee companies to raise additional funds in financial markets that can be volatile . the companies could fail , or not be able to raise additional funds when the funds are needed or they may receive lower valuations , with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings . these events could cause our investments to become impaired . in addition , financial market volatility could negatively affect our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings , mergers , and private sales . for further information about our investment portfolio risks , see Â “ risk factors Â ” in part Â   ii , item Â   1a of this form 10-q . we determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments quarterly for disclosure purposes ; however , the investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized . we determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using the market and income approaches . the market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies , such as projected revenues , earnings , and comparable performance multiples . the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors , including comparable companies Â ’ sizes , growth rates , industries , development stages , and other relevant factors . the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model , which may include one or multiple discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates for the investee : revenue , based on assumed market segment size and assumed market segment share ; expenses , capital spending , and other costs ; and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies . estimates of market segment size , market segment share , expenses , capital spending , and other costs are developed by the investee and / or intel using historical data and available market data . the valuation of our non-marketable investments also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets , recent financing activities by the investees , the investees Â ’ capital structure , and differences in seniority and rights associated with the investees Â ’ capital structure . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) for non-marketable equity investments , the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment , such as : Â   Â • Â   the investee Â ’ s revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business prospects ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the technological feasibility of the investee Â ’ s products and technologies ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the general market conditions in the investee Â ’ s industry or geographic area , including adverse regulatory or economic changes ; Â   Â   Â • Â   factors related to the investee Â ’ s ability to remain in business , such as the investee Â ’ s liquidity , debt ratios , and the rate at which the investee is using its cash ; and Â   Â   Â • Â   the investee Â ’ s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation . if the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value , we determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis , which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal . if the investment is considered to be other than temporarily impaired , we write down the investment to its fair value . impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $ 32 Â   million in the third quarter of 2010 ( $ 95 Â   million in the first nine months of 2010 ) . over the past 12 quarters , including the third quarter of 2010 , impairments of non-marketable equity investments ranged from $ 11 Â   million to $ 896 Â   million per quarter . this range included impairments of $ 896 million during the fourth quarter of 2008 , primarily related to a $ 762 Â   million impairment charge on our investment in clearwire communications , llc ( clearwire llc ) . imft / imfsimft and imfs are variable interest entities that are designed to manufacture and sell nand products to intel and micron technology , inc . at manufacturing cost . we determine the fair value of our investment in imft / imfs using the income approach based on a weighted average of multiple discounted cash flow scenarios of our nand solutions group business , which requires the use of unobservable inputs . unobservable inputs that require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments are the estimates for projected revenue and discount rate . changes in management estimates for these unobservable inputs have the most significant effect on the fair value determination . we have not had an other-than-temporary impairment on our investment in imft / imfs . it is reasonably possible that the estimates used in the fair value determination could change in the near term , which could result in an impairment of our investment . long-lived assetswe assess the impairment of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable . factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations , significant negative industry or economic trends , and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets . we measure the recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows . if an asset grouping Â ’ s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows , the asset grouping is considered to be impaired . the impairment is measured by comparing the difference between the asset grouping Â ’ s carrying value and its fair value . fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date . long-lived assets such as goodwill ; intangible assets ; and property , plant and equipment are considered non-financial assets , and are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized . impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows . due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity , we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings . in addition , as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions , we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets , primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements . when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated , we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets Â ’ new , shorter useful lives . over the past 12 quarters , including the third quarter of 2010 , impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets ranged from $ 10 Â   million to $ 300 million per quarter . income taxeswe must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement purposes . these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits , benefits , and deductions , and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes , as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions . significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets . if recovery is not likely , we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable . we believe that we will ultimately recover a majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated condensed balance sheets . however , should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets , our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely . recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by management Â ’ s plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments ; therefore , changes in management Â ’ s plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes . the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations . we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process . the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit , including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes , if any . if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit , the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 % likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement . it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts , as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes . we re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis . this evaluation is based on factors such as changes in facts or circumstances , changes in tax law , new audit activity , and effectively settled issues . determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment . such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision . inventorythe valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality . the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products . the estimate of future demand is compared to work-in-process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount , if any , of obsolete or excess inventory . as of september Â   25 , 2010 , our work-in-process inventory totaled $ 1 . 6 billion and finished goods inventory totaled $ 1 . 4 Â   billion . the demand forecast is included in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions . product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base , the stage of the product life cycle of our products , consumer confidence , and customer acceptance of our products , as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost . if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly , we could be required to write off inventory , which would negatively impact our gross margin . in order to determine what costs can be included in the valuation of inventory , we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities , based on historical loadings of wafers compared to total available capacity . if the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level , a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory , and therefore would be recognized as cost of sales in that period , which would negatively impact our gross margin . we refer to these costs as excess capacity charges . over the past 12 quarters , excess capacity charges ranged from zero to $ 680 Â   million per quarter . accounting changes and recent accounting standardsfor a description of accounting changes and recent accounting standards , including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects , if any , on our consolidated condensed financial statements , see Â “ note 2 : accounting changes Â ” and Â “ note 3 : recent accounting standards Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q .

measure and record at fair value on a recurring basis . when fair value is determined using pricing models , such as a discounted cash flow model , the issuer Â ’ s credit risk and / or intel Â ’ s credit risk is factored into the calculation of the fair value , as appropriate . marketable debt instrumentsas of september Â   25 , 2010 , our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 23 . 5 Â   billion of marketable debt instruments . of these instruments , $ 5 . 3 Â   billion was classified as level 1 , $ 17 . 9 Â   billion as level 2 , and $ 341 Â   million as level 3 . our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 was classified as such due to the usage of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets . management judgment was required to determine the levels for the frequency of transactions that should be met for a market to be considered active . our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into consideration activity of each individual instrument , including the number of days each individual instrument trades over a specified period . of the $ 17 . 9 Â   billion balance of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2 , approximately 45 % of the balance was classified as level 2 due to the usage of a discounted cash flow model and approximately 55 % due to the usage of non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data . our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes . when observable market data is not available , we corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes using unobservable data , if available . all of our investments in asset-backed securities were classified as level 3 , and substantially all of them were valued using non-binding market consensus prices that we were not able to corroborate with observable market data due to the lack of transparency in the market for asset-backed securities . equity securitiesas of september Â   25 , 2010 , our portfolio of assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 1 . 5 Â   billion of marketable equity securities ( including marketable equity securities receivable ) . of these securities , $ 818 Â   million was classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets . our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one-month period prior to the valuation date for individual securities , including the number of days individual equity securities trade and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding shares of that security . the remaining marketable equity securities of $ 721 Â   million were classified as level 2 because their valuations were either based on quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets or adjusted for security-specific restrictions . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) contractual obligationsin the third quarter of 2010 , we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all outstanding common shares of mcafee , inc . for $ 48 . 00 per share in cash to be paid to the stockholders of mcafee . as of the date we entered into the agreement , the transaction had an approximate value of $ 7 . 68 Â   billion . for further information , see Â “ note 14 : proposed acquisitions Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q . the transaction is subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions . in the third quarter of 2010 , we entered into a definitive agreement with infineon technologies ag to acquire infineon Â ’ s wireless solutions ( wls ) Â   business for approximately $ 1 . 4 Â   billion in cash . the transaction is subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions .

provided in addition to the accompanying consolidated condensed financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations , financial condition , and cash flows . md & a is organized as follows : Â   Â • Â   overview Â   Â   Â • Â   strategy Â   Â   Â • Â   critical accounting estimates Â   Â   Â • Â   results of operations Â   Â   Â • Â   liquidity and capital resources Â   Â   Â • Â   business outlookthe various sections of this md & a contain a number of forward-looking statements . words such as Â “ expects , Â ” Â “ goals , Â ” Â “ plans , Â ” Â “ believes , Â ” Â “ continues , Â ” Â “ may , Â ” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements . in addition , any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance , our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses , and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements . such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in the Â “ business outlook Â ” section ( see also Â “ risk factors Â ” in part Â   ii , item Â   1a of this form 10-q ) . our actual results may differ materially , and these forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures , mergers , acquisitions , or other business combinations that had not been completed as of october Â   27 , 2008 . overviewour goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide digital economy . our primary component-level products include microprocessors , chipsets , and flash memory . net revenue , gross margin , operating income , and net income for the second and third quarters of 2008 and the third quarter of 2007 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   q32008 Â   Â   q22008 Â   Â   q32007 Â   net revenue Â   $ 10 , 217 Â   Â   $ 9 , 470 Â   Â   $ 10 , 090 Â   gross margin Â   $ 6 , 019 Â   Â   $ 5 , 249 Â   Â   $ 5 , 171 Â   operating income Â   $ 3 , 098 Â   Â   $ 2 , 255 Â   Â   $ 2 , 144 Â   net income Â   $ 2 , 014 Â   Â   $ 1 , 601 Â   Â   $ 1 , 791 Â   the third quarter of 2008 showed strong financial results . while the economic outlook is uncertain , our competitive position , manufacturing process technologies , cash flow from operations , and balance sheet remain strong . additionally , over the last two years we have focused on improving efficiency and reducing spending as a percentage of revenue . revenue for the third quarter of 2008 was up 8 % from the second quarter as we saw continued growth in our microprocessor and chipset unit sales , particularly in the mobile market segment . compared to the third quarter of 2007 , revenue was approximately flat , as higher revenue from microprocessors and chipsets was mostly offset by the impacts of divestitures . our overall gross margin dollars for the third quarter of 2008 increased 15 % compared to the second quarter of 2008 , and increased 16 % compared to the third quarter of 2007 . our overall gross margin percentage for the third quarter of 2008 was 58 . 9 % , compared to 55 . 4 % in the second quarter of 2008 and 51 . 2 % in the third quarter of 2007 . lower microprocessor unit costs and increases in microprocessor revenue contributed to the gross margin percentage increase compared to the second quarter of 2008 . compared to the third quarter of 2007 , our gross margin percentage increased due to lower microprocessor and chipset unit costs , higher microprocessor unit sales , and the impact of the divestitures of lower gross margin products lines . these increases were partially offset by lower microprocessor average selling prices . operating income for the third quarter of 2008 increased 37 % compared to the second quarter of 2008 and 44 % compared to the third quarter of 2007 . we continue to strengthen our competitive position by entering new market segments . our intel Â ® tm Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) historically , our sales of microprocessors have been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year . consumer purchases of pcs have been higher in the second half of the year , primarily due to back-to-school and holiday demand . in addition , purchases from businesses have also tended to be higher in the second half of the year . while our microprocessor sales generally have followed this seasonal trend , there can be no assurance that this trend will continue . our revenue outlook for the fourth quarter of 2008 includes a wider than typical range due to the uncertainty of how the current economic environment will impact our business . the low end of the range would result in revenue being slightly lower than the third quarter of 2008 and the high end of the range would result in an increase that is at the lower end of our seasonal trends . while we currently believe our inventory levels are appropriate , the economic uncertainty may result in lower than expected demand . this in turn may require us to write off excess inventory and would negatively impact our gross margin if we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly . additionally , demand is impacted by possible changes in our customers Â ’ desired inventory levels as they manage their business through the current economic uncertainty . we continue to monitor the inventory levels of our customers and are seeing some customers build microprocessor and chipset inventory . the higher chipset revenue we experienced in the third quarter would normally be a sign that customers are building ahead of a strong fourth quarter . however , with the current macroeconomic environment , it is hard to discern what demand will be for the fourth quarter of 2008 . in the third quarter of 2008 we recorded a $ 250 Â   million impairment on our investment in numonyx due to a decline in the nor flash memory market segment . in the nand flash memory market segment , we are expecting to record restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 2008 of approximately $ 200 million relating to our joint decision with micron to discontinue the supply of nand flash memory from a facility within the imft manufacturing network . additionally , the imfs planned fabrication facility in singapore has been placed on hold as we continue to take actions to reduce supply in light of current market conditions . the majority of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio balance is concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment . therefore , continued declines in this market segment or changes in management Â ’ s plans with respect to our investments in this market segment could result in charges . from a financial condition perspective , we ended the third quarter of 2008 with an investment portfolio valued at $ 15 . 6 Â   billion , consisting of cash and cash equivalents , fixed-income trading assets , and short- and long-term investments . in addition , we generated $ 8 . 3 Â   billion from cash from operations in the first nine months of the year . the credit quality of our investment portfolio remains high during this difficult credit environment , with other-than-temporary impairments on our available-for-sale investments in debt instruments limited to $ 32 Â   million during the first nine months of 2008 . our ability to access funds through the credit markets , including through the issuance of commercial paper , remains unchanged . in addition , we have not seen any change in our ability to invest in high quality debt instruments , and earn a return on those investments . with the exception of a limited amount of investments for which we have recognized other-than-temporary impairments , as well as our investment in the reserve primary fund of $ 250 Â   million , we have not seen liquidation delays and we have received the full par value of our original debt investments when they matured . see Â “ liquidity and capital resources Â ” for additional details on our investment portfolio . during the first nine months of 2008 , we repurchased $ 7 . 1 Â   billion of stock through our stock repurchase program and paid $ 2 . 3 Â   billion to stockholders as dividends . strategyour goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide digital economy . as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment , we use our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits , as well as our financial resources , global presence , and brand recognition . we believe that we have the scale , capacity , and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to customers Â ’ needs quickly . some of our key focus areas are listed below : Â   Â • Â   customer orientation . Â   Â   Â • Â   energy-efficient performance . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   Â • Â   design and manufacturing technology leadership . Â   Â   Â • Â   strategic investments . Â   Â   Â • Â   business environment and softwarewe believe that the proliferation of the internet , including user demand for premium content and rich media , is the primary driver of the need for greater performance in pcs and servers . a growing number of older pcs are increasingly incapable of handling the tasks that users are demanding , such as streaming video , uploading photos , and online gaming . as these tasks become even more demanding and require more computing power , we believe that users will need and want to buy new pcs to perform everyday tasks on the internet . we also believe that increased internet traffic is creating a need for greater server infrastructure , including server products optimized for energy-efficient performance . the trend of mobile microprocessor unit growth outpacing the growth in desktop microprocessor units has continued , and shipments of our mobile microprocessors exceeded our desktop microprocessors for the first time in the second quarter of 2008 . we believe that the demand for mobile microprocessors will result in the increased development of products with form factors and uses that require low-power microprocessors . with our research and development ( r & d ) expenditures , we are investing in areas in which we believe the application of highly integrated intel Â ® Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) strategy by operating segmentwe completed a reorganization in the second quarter of 2008 that transferred the revenue and costs associated with a portion of the digital home group Â ’ s consumer pc components business to the digital enterprise group . the digital home group now focuses on the consumer electronics components business . the strategy by operating segment presented below is based on the new organizational structure . our digital enterprise group the strategy for our mobility group the strategy for our nand products group the flash memory group the strategy for our digital home group the strategy for our digital health group the strategy for our software and services group critical accounting estimatesthe methods , estimates , and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our financial statements . some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments , often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain . our most critical accounting estimates include : Â   Â • Â   the valuation and recognition of non-marketable equity investments , which impacts net gains ( losses ) Â   on equity investments when we record impairments ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the valuation and recognition of investments in debt instruments , which impacts our investment portfolio balance when we assess fair value , and interest and other , net when we record impairments ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets , which primarily impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation ; Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   Â • Â   the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes ( including the measurement of uncertain tax positions ) , which impact our provision for taxes ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the valuation of inventory , which impacts gross margin ; and Â   Â   Â • Â   the valuation and recognition of share-based compensation , which impact gross margin ; r & d expenses ; and marketing , general and administrative expenses . below , we discuss these policies further , as well as the estimates and judgments involved . we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies , such as those for revenue recognition , including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors ; however , these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective . non-marketable equity investmentswe regularly invest in the non-marketable equity instruments of private companies , which range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models . the carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio , excluding equity derivatives , totaled $ 4 . 2 Â   billion as of september Â   27 , 2008 ( $ 3 . 4 Â   billion as of december Â   29 , 2007 ) . the majority of the balance as of september Â   27 , 2008 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment , including our investments in im flash technologies , llc ( imft ) Â   of $ 2 . 0 Â   billion ( $ 2 . 2 Â   billion as of december Â   29 , 2007 ) , our investment in im flash singapore , llp ( imfs ) Â   of $ 346 Â   million ( $ 146 Â   million as of december Â   29 , 2007 ) , and our investment in numonyx of $ 503 Â   million ( see Â “ note 16 : equity investments Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q ) . our non-marketable equity investments are classified in other long-term assets on the consolidated condensed balance sheets . for further information about investment portfolio risks , including those specific to our investments in the flash memory market segment , see Â “ risk factors Â ” in part Â   ii , item Â   1a of this form 10-q . non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky , and a number of these companies are likely to fail . their success is dependent on product development , market acceptance , operational efficiency , and other factors . in addition , depending on their future prospects and on market conditions , they may not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations , with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings , and our investments would likely become impaired . we review our investments quarterly for indicators of impairment ; however , for non-marketable equity investments , the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would significantly harm the fair value of the investment . the indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances primarily include : Â   Â • Â   the investee Â ’ s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the technological feasibility of the investee Â ’ s products and technologies ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the general market conditions in the investee Â ’ s industry or geographic area , including adverse regulatory or economic changes ; Â   Â   Â • Â   factors related to the investee Â ’ s ability to remain in business , such as the investee Â ’ s liquidity , debt ratios , and the rate at which the investee is using its cash ; and Â   Â   Â • Â   the investee Â ’ s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation . investments that we identify as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired , in which case we write down the investment to its estimated fair value . beginning in the first quarter of 2008 , the assessment of fair value for non-marketable investments is based on the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards ( sfas ) Â   no . Â   157 , Â “ fair value measurements Â ” ( sfas no . Â   157 ) . non-marketable investments that are considered impaired are classified as level 3 instruments ( see Â “ note 3 : fair value Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q ) , as we use unobservable inputs to value these investments that are significant to the fair value measurement and the valuation requires management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices , inherent lack of liquidity , and the long-term nature of such investments . we measure fair value using financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies and / or a discounted cash flow approach . the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors including comparable companies Â ’ sizes , growth rates , products and service lines , development stage , and other relevant factors . the discounted cash flow approach includes the following significant estimates for the investee : revenue , based on assumed market segment growth rates and assumed market segment share ; estimated costs ; and appropriate discount rates based on the investee Â ’ s weighted average cost of capital , as determined by considering the observable weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies . estimates of market segment growth , market segment share , and costs are developed by the investee and / or intel in consideration of historical data and available market data . the valuation of our non-marketable investments also takes into account movements of the equity and venture capital markets , recent financing activities by the investees , changes in the interest rate environment , the investee Â ’ s capital structure , liquidation preferences for the investee Â ’ s capital , and other economic variables . see Â “ note 3 : fair value Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q for further discussion on the adoption of sfas no . Â   157 . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) approximately $ 527 Â   million of our non-marketable equity investments as of september Â   27 , 2008 were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis due to the recording of other-than-temporary impairment charges . other-than-temporary impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $ 281 million in the third quarter of 2008 ( $ 325 Â   million in the first nine months of 2008 ) . over the past 12 quarters , including the third quarter of 2008 , impairments of non-marketable equity investments have averaged $ 47 Â   million per quarter ( ranging from $ 10 Â   million to $ 281 Â   million per quarter ) . investments in debt instrumentsfair valuein the current market environment , the assessment of the fair value of debt instruments can be difficult and subjective . the volume of trading activity of certain debt instruments has declined , and the rapid changes occurring in today Â ’ s financial markets can lead to changes in the fair value of financial instruments in relatively short periods of time . sfas no . Â   157 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value ( see Â “ note 3 : fair value Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q ) . each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value . level 1 instruments generally represent quoted prices in active markets . therefore , determining fair value for level 1 instruments generally does not require significant management judgment , and the estimation is not difficult . level 2 instruments include observable inputs other than level 1 prices such as quoted prices for identical instruments in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions ( less active markets ) ; non-binding market consensus prices that can be corroborated with observable market data ; model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities ; or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities . these level 2 instruments require more management judgment and subjectivity compared to level 1 instruments , including : Â   Â • Â   determining which instruments are most similar to the instrument being priced requires management to identify a sample of similar securities based on the coupon rates , maturity , issuer , credit rating , and instrument type , and subjectively select an individual security or multiple securities that are deemed most similar to the security being priced . Â   Â   Â • Â   determining whether a market is considered active requires management judgment . our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one month period prior to the valuation date of each individual instrument , including the number of days each individual instrument trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding amount of the issued instrument . approximately 15 % of our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2 instruments were classified as such due to the usage of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in less active markets . Â   Â   Â • Â   determining which model-derived valuations to use in determining fair value . when observable market prices for identical securities or similar securities are not available , we price our marketable debt instruments using : non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data ; or pricing models , such as discounted cash flow approaches , with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data . in addition , the credit ratings for issuers of debt instruments in which we are invested could change , which could lead to lower fair values . as of september Â   27 , 2008 , we had an investment of $ 250 Â   million in the reserve primary fund . this fund did not meet redemption requests and received approval from the securities and exchange commission to temporarily suspend payments to investors . we reclassified our investment in the reserve primary fund from level 1 to level 2 because the temporary suspension of redemptions in the reserve primary fund was in place as of as september Â   27 , 2008 , therefore there was not an active market to meet the criteria for level 1 classification . we have valued our investment in the reserve primary fund at $ 1 . 00 per share . we redeemed these shares for $ 1 . 00 per share prior to the end of the third quarter ; however , we have not yet received the distribution of our redemption . to the extent that the proceeds we receive are less than $ 1 . 00 per share , we would incur a loss . level 3 instruments include unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities . the determination of fair value for level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity . most of our marketable debt instruments classified as level 3 are valued using a non-binding market consensus price or a non-binding broker quote , both of which we corroborate with unobservable data . non-binding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary models of pricing providers or brokers that utilize observable market data as valuation inputs and are also based on the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers . adjustments to the fair value of instruments priced using non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes , and classified as level 3 instruments , were not significant in the first , second , or third quarters of 2008 . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) other-than-temporary impairmentafter determining the fair value of our available-for-sale debt instruments , gains or losses on these securities are recorded to other comprehensive income , until either the security is sold or we determine that the decline in value is other-than-temporary . determining whether the decline in fair value is other-than-temporary requires management judgment based on the specific facts and circumstances of each investment . for investments in debt instruments , these judgments primarily consider : a ) the financial condition and liquidity of the issuer , the issuer Â ’ s credit rating , and any specific events which may cause us to believe the debt instrument will not mature and be paid in full ; and b ) our ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity . given the current market conditions , these judgments could prove to be wrong , and companies with relatively high credit ratings and solid financial conditions may not be able to fulfill their obligations . in addition , a decision by management to no longer hold an investment until maturity may result in the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment . as of september Â   27 , 2008 , our investments included $ 11 . 9 Â   billion of available-for-sale debt instruments . during the third quarter of 2008 , we recognized $ 14 Â   million in other-than-temporary impairments on our available-for-sale debt instruments ( $ 32 Â   million in the nine months ended september Â   27 , 2008 ) . as of september Â   27 , 2008 , our cumulative unrealized losses related to debt instruments classified as available-for-sale was approximately $ 120 Â   million ( approximately $ 55 million as of december Â   29 , 2007 ) . these unrecognized losses could be recognized in the future if our other-than-temporary assessment changes . long-lived assetswe assess the impairment of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable . factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations , significant negative industry or economic trends , and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets . recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows . if an asset grouping Â ’ s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows , the asset grouping is considered to be impaired . the impairment is measured by comparing the difference between the asset grouping Â ’ s carrying amount and its fair value , based on the best information available , including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis . impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows . due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity , we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings . in addition , as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions , we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets , primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements . when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated , we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets Â ’ new , shorter useful lives . over the past 12 quarters , including the third quarter of 2008 , impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets have ranged between $ 1 Â   million and $ 320 Â   million per quarter . the restructuring related asset impairments have ranged between zero and $ 317 Â   million per quarter since the program began in the third quarter of 2006 . over the past 12 quarters , other asset impairments have ranged between $ 1 Â   million and $ 26 Â   million per quarter . long-lived assets such as goodwill , intangible assets , and property , plant , and equipment , are considered non-financial assets , and are only measured at fair value when indicators of impairment exist . the accounting and disclosure provisions of sfas no . Â   157 will not be effective for these assets until the first quarter of 2009 . see Â “ note 2 : recent accounting pronouncements and accounting changes Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q for further discussion . income taxeswe must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes . these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits , benefits , and deductions , and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities , which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes , as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions . significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period . we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets . if recovery is not likely , we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable . we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated condensed balance sheets . however , should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets , our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations . in accordance with financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) interpretation no . Â   48 , Â “ accounting for uncertainty in income taxes Â – an interpretation of sfas no . 109 Â ” ( fin 48 ) , and related guidance , we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process . the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit , including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes , if any . if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit , then the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 % likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement . it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts , as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes . we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis . this evaluation is based on factors including , but not limited to , changes in facts or circumstances , changes in tax law , effectively settled issues under audit , and new audit activity . such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision . inventorythe valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality . the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products . the demand forecast is included in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions . product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base , the stage of the product life cycle of our products , consumer confidence , and customer acceptance of our products , as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost . if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly , or if we fail to forecast the demand accurately , we could be required to write off inventory , which would negatively impact our gross margin . share-based compensationtotal share-based compensation was $ 197 Â   million during the third quarter of 2008 and $ 659 Â   million for the first nine months of 2008 ( $ 227 Â   million in the third quarter of 2007 and $ 748 Â   million in the first nine months of 2007 ) . determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock purchase plans at the date of grant require judgment . we use the black-scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of these share-based awards consistent with the provisions of sfas no . Â   123 ( revised 2004 ) , Â “ share-based payment Â ” ( sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) ) . option pricing models , including the black-scholes model , also require the use of input assumptions , including expected volatility , expected life , expected dividend rate , and expected risk-free rate of return . the assumptions for expected volatility and expected life are the two assumptions that significantly affect the grant date fair value . changes in the expected dividend rate and expected risk-free rate of return do not significantly impact the calculation of fair value , and determining these inputs is not highly subjective . we use implied volatility based on freely traded options in the open market , as we believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility . in determining the appropriateness of implied volatility , we considered the following : Â   Â • Â   the volume of market activity of freely traded options , and determined that there was sufficient market activity ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the ability to reasonably match the input variables of freely traded options to those of options granted by the company , such as the date of grant and the exercise price , and determined that the input assumptions were comparable ; and Â   Â   Â • Â   the term of freely traded options used to derive implied volatility , which is generally one to two years , and determined that the length of term was sufficient . due to significant differences in the vesting terms and contractual life of current option grants compared to the majority of our historical grants , management does not believe that our historical share option exercise data provides us with sufficient evidence to estimate expected life . therefore , we use the simplified method of calculating expected life described in the sec Â ’ s staff accounting bulletin 107 ( sab 107 ) , as amended by staff accounting bulletin 110 ( sab 110 ) . we will continue to use the simplified method until we have the historical data necessary to provide a reasonable estimate of expected life , in accordance with sab 107 , as amended by sab 110 . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) higher volatility and longer expected lives result in an increase to share-based compensation determined at the date of grant . the effect that changes in the volatility and the expected life would have on the weighted average fair value of option awards and the increase in total fair value is as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   q32008 Â   Â   ytd 2008 Â   Â   Â   weighted Â   Â   increase in total Â   Â   weighted Â   Â   increase in total Â   Â   Â   average Â   Â   fair value1 Â   Â   average Â   Â   fair value1 Â   Â   Â   fair value Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   Â   fair value Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   as reported Â   $ 6 . 10 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   $ 5 . 82 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   hypothetical : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   increase expected volatility by 5 Â   percentage points2 Â   $ 6 . 86 Â   Â   $ Â — Â   Â   $ 6 . 63 Â   Â   $ 16 Â   increase expected lives by 1 Â   year Â   $ 6 . 51 Â   Â   $ Â — Â   Â   $ 6 . 24 Â   Â   $ 8 Â   Â   1 Â   amounts represent the hypothetical increase in the total fair value determined at the date of grant , which would be amortized over the service period , net of estimated forfeitures . Â   2 Â   for example , an increase from 36 % reported volatility for q3 2008 to a hypothetical 41 % volatility . since the adoption of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) , reported volatility has ranged from 25 % to 38 % . in addition , sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share-based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover . quarterly adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on reported share-based compensation , as we recognize the cumulative effect of the rate adjustments for all expense amortization after january Â   1 , 2006 in the period the estimated forfeiture rates are adjusted . we estimate and adjust forfeiture rates based on a quarterly review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover . if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate , we make an adjustment that will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements . if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate , we make an adjustment that will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements . these adjustments affect our gross margin ; r & d expenses ; and marketing , general and administrative expenses . the effect of forfeiture adjustments in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2008 was not significant . we record cumulative adjustments to the extent that the related expense is recognized in the financial statements , beginning with implementation of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) in the first quarter of 2006 . adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates could also cause changes in the amount of expense that we recognize in future periods .

Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) digital enterprise groupthe revenue and operating income for the digital enterprise group operating segment for the first nine months of 2008 and the first nine months of 2007 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   ytd 2008 Â   Â   ytd 2007 Â   microprocessor revenue Â   $ 12 , 413 Â   Â   $ 11 , 456 Â   chipset , motherboard , and other revenue Â   Â   3 , 719 Â   Â   Â   3 , 887 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   net revenue Â   $ 16 , 132 Â   Â   $ 15 , 343 Â   operating income Â   $ 5 , 242 Â   Â   $ 3 , 113 Â   net revenue for the deg operating segment increased by $ 789 Â   million , or 5 % , in the first nine months of 2008 compared to the first nine months of 2007 . the increase in microprocessor revenue was due to higher microprocessor unit sales , and to a lesser extent , higher microprocessor average selling prices . a higher mix of enterprise microprocessor unit sales also had a positive impact on total average selling prices within the deg operating segment . the decrease in chipset , motherboard , and other revenue was primarily due to lower motherboard unit sales and lower chipset average selling prices , partially offset by higher chipset unit sales . operating income increased by $ 2 . 1 Â   billion , or 68 % , in the first nine months of 2008 compared to the first nine months of 2007 . the increase in operating income was primarily due to higher microprocessor revenue and lower microprocessor and chipset unit costs . lower startup costs of approximately $ 360 Â   million , approximately $ 180 Â   million of lower factory underutilization charges related to chipset production , and lower operating expenses were partially offset by sales in the first nine months of 2007 of desktop microprocessors that had been previously written off . mobility groupthe revenue and operating income for the mobility group operating segment for the first nine months of 2008 and the first nine months of 2007 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   ytd 2008 Â   Â   ytd 2007 Â   microprocessor revenue Â   $ 8 , 855 Â   Â   $ 7 , 671 Â   chipset and other revenue Â   Â   3 , 292 Â   Â   Â   2 , 903 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   net revenue Â   $ 12 , 147 Â   Â   $ 10 , 574 Â   operating income Â   $ 4 , 265 Â   Â   $ 3 , 928 Â   net revenue for the mg operating segment increased by $ 1 . 6 Â   billion , or 15 % , in the first nine months of 2008 compared to the first nine months of 2007 . the increase in microprocessor revenue was due to significantly higher microprocessor unit sales , which were partially offset by significantly lower microprocessor average selling prices . the increase in chipset and other revenue was primarily due to higher chipset unit sales , which were partially offset by lower revenue from the sale of cellular baseband products . we are winding down the sales from the manufacturing agreement entered into as part of the divesture of the cellular baseband business . operating income increased by $ 337 Â   million , or 9 % , in the first nine months of 2008 compared to the first nine months of 2007 . higher microprocessor and chipset revenue and lower microprocessor unit costs were partially offset by higher operating expenses . operating expensesoperating expenses for the first nine months of 2008 and the first nine months of 2007 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   ytd 2008 Â   Â   ytd 2007 Â   research and development Â   $ 4 , 406 Â   Â   $ 4 , 274 Â   marketing , general and administrative Â   $ 4 , 195 Â   Â   $ 3 , 953 Â   restructuring and asset impairment charges Â   $ 459 Â   Â   $ 282 Â   Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) research and development . marketing , general and administrativer & d , combined with marketing , general and administrative expenses , were 29 % of net revenue in the first nine months of 2008 ( 30 % of net revenue in the first nine months of 2007 ) . restructuring and asset impairment charges .

Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) we estimate that employee severance and benefit charges to date will result in gross annual savings of approximately $ 1 . 1 Â   billion , a portion of which we began to realize as early as q3 2006 . we are realizing these savings within marketing , general and administrative expenses , cost of sales , and r & d . our outlook for q4 2008 is for additional restructuring and asset impairment charges of $ 250 million , which includes charges related our joint decision with micron to discontinue the supply of nand flash memory from a facility within the imft manufacturing network ( see Â “ note 16 : equity investments Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q for further information ) . we may incur additional restructuring charges in the future for employee severance and benefit arrangements , as well as facility-related or other exit activities . gains ( losses ) on equity investments , interest and other , and provision for taxesgains ( losses ) Â   on equity investments , net ; interest and other , net ; and provision for taxes for the first nine months of 2008 and the first nine months of 2007 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   ytd 2008 Â   Â   ytd 2007 Â   gains ( losses ) Â   on equity investments , net Â   $ ( 564 ) Â   $ 176 Â   interest and other , net Â   $ 466 Â   Â   $ 560 Â   provision for taxes Â   $ ( 2 , 259 ) Â   $ ( 1 , 200 ) gains ( losses ) Â   on equity investments , net , for the first nine months of 2008 was a net loss of $ 564 million compared to a net gain of $ 176 Â   million in the first nine months of 2007 . we recognized higher impairment charges , higher equity method losses , and lower gains on sales of equity investments in the first nine months of 2008 compared to the first nine months of 2007 . in addition , the first nine months of 2007 included approximately $ 110 Â   million of dividend income from one of our investments . impairment charges in the first nine months of 2008 included a $ 250 Â   million impairment charge on our investment in numonyx and $ 97 Â   million of impairment charges on our investment in micron . the impairment charges on our investment in numonyx was due to a general decline in the nor flash memory market segment . the impairment charges on our investment in micron reflect the difference between our cost basis and the fair value of our investment in micron at the end of the quarter and were principally based on our assessment of micron Â ’ s financial results and the competitive environment , particularly for nand memory products . our equity method losses were primarily related to net losses recognized on our investment in clearwire ( $ 118 Â   million in the first nine months of 2008 and $ 31 Â   million in the first nine months of 2007 ) and numonyx ( $ 68 million in the first nine months of 2008 ) . the net loss of $ 31 Â   million recognized on our investment in clearwire in the first nine months of 2007 included a gain of $ 39 Â   million from q1 2007 as a result of clearwire Â ’ s initial public offering . interest and other , net decreased to $ 466 Â   million in the first nine months of 2008 compared to $ 560 million in the first nine months of 2007 . lower interest income and fair value losses experienced in the first nine months of 2008 on our trading assets were partially offset by higher gains on divestitures ( $ 59 Â   million in the first nine months of 2008 and $ 21 Â   million in the first nine months of 2007 ) . interest income was lower in the first nine months of 2008 compared to the first nine months of 2007 as a result of lower interest rates , partially offset by higher average investment balances . for details of our net losses recognized within gains ( losses ) Â   on equity investments , net and interest and other , net , attributable to financial instruments categorized as level 3 under the sfas no .

Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) liquidity and capital resourcescash , short-term investments , marketable debt instruments included in trading assets , and debt at the end of each period were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   sept .

Â   159 , Â “ the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities Â — including an amendment of fasb statement no . Â   115 Â ” ( sfas no . Â   159 ) . investing activitiesinvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures , net investment purchases , maturities , and disposals , and investments in non-marketable and other equity investments . the decrease in cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of 2008 , compared to the first nine months of 2007 , was primarily due to a decrease in purchases and an increase in maturities of available-for-sale debt investments . lower investments in non-marketable equity investments ( primarily related to our investments in imft and imfs ) and lower capital spending also contributed to less cash used for investing activities in the first nine months of 2008 compared to the first nine months of 2007 . due to the adoption of sfas no . Â   159 , purchases and maturities for marketable debt instruments classified as trading assets are included in investing activity for the first nine months of 2008 , which caused an increase in cash outflows from investing activities in the first nine months of 2008 compared to the first nine months of 2007 , as the related cash outflows were previously included as operating activities . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) financing activitiesfinancing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases and retirement of common stock , payment of dividends to stockholders , and proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans . the higher cash used in financing activities in the first nine months of 2008 , compared to the first nine months of 2007 , was primarily due to an increase in repurchases and retirement of common stock and lower proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee equity incentive plans . for the first nine months of 2008 , we repurchased $ 7 . 2 Â   billion of common stock compared to $ 1 . 3 Â   billion repurchased in the first nine months of 2007 . as of september Â   27 , 2008 , $ 7 . 4 Â   billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization of $ 25 Â   billion . we base our level of stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions , and this level may fluctuate . for the first nine months of 2008 , proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee equity incentive plans were $ 1 . 1 Â   billion compared to $ 2 . 2 Â   billion during the first nine months of 2007 as a result of a lower volume of employee exercises of stock options . for the first nine months of 2008 , we paid $ 2 . 3 Â   billion in cash dividends , higher than the $ 2 . 0 Â   billion paid in the same period of the prior year , due to increases in quarterly cash dividends per common share . the higher dividend payments were offset by the $ 250 Â   million of commercial paper outstanding as of september 27 , 2008 ( none outstanding in 2007 ) . liquiditycash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity . as of september Â   27 , 2008 , we also had an investment portfolio valued at $ 15 . 6 Â   billion , consisting of cash and cash equivalents , marketable debt instruments included in trading assets , and short- and long-term investments . our investment policy requires all investments with original maturities up to 6 Â   months to be rated at least a-1 / p-1 by standard & poor Â ’ s / moody Â ’ s , and specifies a higher minimum rating for investments with longer maturities . for instance , investments with maturities beyond three years require a minimum rating of aa- / aa3 . government regulations imposed on investment alternatives of our non-u . s . subsidiaries , or the absence of a rated counterparties in certain countries , result in some minor exceptions , which are reviewed annually by the finance committee of our board of directors . substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with a / a2 or better rated issuers , and the majority of the issuers are rated aa- / aa2 or better . additionally , we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our periodic analysis of that counterparty Â ’ s relative credit standing . as of september Â   27 , 2008 , the total credit exposure to any single counterparty did not exceed $ 500 Â   million . credit rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for investments . the amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the amounts , if any , by which a counterparty Â ’ s obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty . we also enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions . the credit quality of our investment portfolio remains high during this difficult credit environment , with other-than-temporary impairments on our available-for-sale debt instruments limited to $ 32 Â   million during the first nine months of 2008 . in addition , we have not seen any change in our ability to invest in high quality debt investments , and earn a return on those investments . with the exception of a limited amount of investments for which we have recognized other-than-temporary impairments , as well as our investment in the reserve primary fund of $ 250 million , we have not seen significant liquidation delays and we have received the full par value of our original debt investments when they matured . we have the intent and ability to hold our debt investments that have unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amounts invested . as of september Â   27 , 2008 , $ 10 . 3 Â   billion of our portfolio had a remaining maturity of less than one year . as of september Â   27 , 2008 , our cumulative unrealized losses , net of corresponding hedging activities , related to debt instruments classified as trading assets was approximately $ 65 Â   million ( approximately $ 25 Â   million as of december Â   29 , 2007 ) . as of september Â   27 , 2008 , our cumulative unrealized losses related to debt instruments classified as available-for-sale was approximately $ 120 Â   million ( approximately $ 55 Â   million as of december Â   29 , 2007 ) . substantially all of our unrealized losses can be attributed to fair value fluctuations in an unstable credit environment that resulted in a decrease in the market liquidity for debt instruments . our portfolio includes $ 1 . 3 Â   billion of asset-backed securities as of september Â   27 , 2008 . approximately one-third of these securities were collateralized by first-lien mortgages , and the remaining were collateralized by student loans , credit card debt , or auto loans . during the first nine months of 2008 , our asset-backed securities experienced net unrealized fair value declines totaling $ 48 Â   million , of which $ 46 Â   million was recognized in our consolidated condensed statements of income . as of september Â   27 , 2008 , the expected weighted average remaining maturity was less than two years . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) we continually monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and mitigate our credit and interest rate exposures in accordance with the policies approved by our board of directors . we intend to continue to closely monitor future developments in the credit markets and make appropriate changes to our investment policy as deemed necessary . based on our ability to liquidate our investment portfolio and our expected operating cash flows , we do not anticipate any liquidity constraints as a result of either the current credit environment or potential investment fair value fluctuations . our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity . we have an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $ 3 . 0 Â   billion , including through the issuance of commercial paper . maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during the third quarter of 2008 were approximately $ 1 . 3 Â   billion , and $ 250 Â   million of commercial paper remained outstanding as of september Â   27 , 2008 . our commercial paper was rated a-1 + by standard & poor Â ’ s and p-1 by moody Â ’ s as of september Â   27 , 2008 . despite the recent tightening of the credit markets , our ability to access funds through the credit markets , including through the issuance of commercial paper , remains unchanged . we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt , equity , and other securities . we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 Â   months , including capital expenditures for the expansion or upgrading of worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test capacity , working capital requirements , and potential dividends , stock repurchases , and acquisitions or strategic investments . off-balance sheet arrangementsduring the second quarter of 2008 , we guaranteed the repayment of $ 275 Â   million in principal of numonyx Â ’ s payment obligations under its senior credit facility , as well as accrued unpaid interest , expenses of the lenders and penalties . see Â “ note 16 : equity investments Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q for further discussion . contractual obligationsduring the second quarter of 2008 , clearwire and sprint nextel corporation entered into an agreement to reorganize clearwire into a new company . we have agreed to invest $ 1 . 0 Â   billion in this new company . see Â “ note 16 : equity investments Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q for further discussion . the requirement to make the $ 1 . 0 Â   billion investment is subject to certain closing conditions . fair valuebeginning in the first quarter of 2008 , the assessment of fair value for our financial instruments is based on the provisions of sfas no . Â   157 . sfas no . Â   157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value . observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party , whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability . a financial instrument Â ’ s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement . credit risk is factored into the valuation of financial instruments that we measure at fair value on a recurring basis . when fair value is determined using observable market prices , the credit risk is incorporated into the market price of the financial instrument . when fair value is determined using pricing models , such as a discounted cash flow approach , the issuer Â ’ s credit risk as well as intel Â ’ s credit risk is factored into the calculation of the fair value . during the third quarter of 2008 and the first nine months of 2008 , the valuation of our liabilities measured at fair value as well as our derivative instruments in a net liability position were not impacted by changes in our credit risk . the deterioration of the credit ratings of certain of our counterparties did not have a significant impact on the valuation of either our marketable debt instruments or derivative instruments in a net asset position . when values are determined using inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the values of the instruments being measured , we classify those instruments as level 3 under the sfas no . Â   157 hierarchy . as of september Â   27 , 2008 , our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 16 . 4 Â   billion of assets , of which $ 2 . 0 Â   billion ( 12 % ) were classified as level 3 instruments . in addition , our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 357 Â   million of liabilities , of which $ 145 Â   million ( 41 % ) were classified as level 3 instruments . in the first nine months of 2008 , we transferred approximately $ 675 Â   million of assets from level 3 to level 2 , due to a greater availability of observable market data . these assets primarily consisted of floating-rate notes . during the first nine months of 2008 , we recognized an insignificant amount of losses on these instruments . during the first nine months of 2008 , the level 3 assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis experienced net unrealized fair value declines totaling $ 71 Â   million . of these declines , $ 43 Â   million were recognized in our consolidated condensed statements of income . we believe the remaining $ 28 Â   million , included in other comprehensive income , represents a temporary decline in the fair value of available-for-sale investments . we did not experience any significant realized gains ( losses ) Â   related to the level 3 assets or liabilities in our portfolio . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) marketable debt instrumentsas of september Â   27 , 2008 , our assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 15 . 4 billion of marketable debt instruments . of these instruments , approximately $ 1 . 5 Â   billion were classified as level 1 , approximately $ 11 . 9 Â   billion were classified as level 2 , and approximately $ 2 . 0 Â   billion were classified as level 3 . when available , we use observable market prices for identical securities to value our marketable debt instruments . if observable market prices are not available , we use non-binding market consensus prices that we seek to corroborate with observable market data , if available , or non-observable market data . when prices from multiple sources are available for a given instrument , we use observable market quotes to price our instruments , in lieu of prices from other sources . our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 instruments were classified as such due to the usage of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets . marketable debt instruments in this category generally include certain of our floating-rate notes , corporate bonds , and money market fund deposits . management judgment was required to determine our policy that defines the levels at which sufficient volume and frequency of transactions are met for a market to be considered active . our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one month period prior to the valuation date of each individual instrument , including the number of days each individual instrument trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding amount of the issued instrument . approximately 15 % of our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2 instruments were classified as such due to the usage of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in less active markets . when observable market prices for identical securities are not available , we price our marketable debt instruments using : non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data ; quoted market prices for similar instruments ; or pricing models , such as a discounted cash flow approach , with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data . non-binding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary models of pricing providers or brokers that utilize observable market data as valuation inputs and are also based on the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers . these models incorporate a number of valuation inputs including non-binding and binding broker quotes ; observable market prices for identical and / or similar securities ; and proprietary valuation methodologies using observable market inputs and to a lesser degree non-observable market inputs . we corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices with observable market prices using statistical models when observable market prices exist . the discounted cash flow approach uses observable market inputs , such as libor-based yield curves , currency spot and forward rates , and credit ratings . approximately 40 % of our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2 instruments were classified as such due to the usage of a discounted cash flow approach , approximately 40 % due to the usage of non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data , and approximately 5 % due to the usage of quoted market prices for similar instruments . marketable debt instruments classified as level 2 instruments generally include commercial paper , bank time deposits , municipal bonds , certain of our money market fund deposits , and a majority of floating-rate notes and corporate bonds . our marketable debt instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3 instruments were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes . when observable market data is not available , we corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes using unobservable data . marketable debt instruments in this category generally include asset-backed securities and certain of our floating-rate notes and corporate bonds . all of our investments in asset-backed securities were classified as level 3 , and substantially all of them were valued using non-binding market consensus prices that we were not able to corroborate with observable market data due to the lack of transparency in the market for asset-backed securities . money market fund depositsas of september Â   27 , 2008 , our marketable debt instruments included $ 1 . 7 Â   billion of money market fund deposits . of these money market fund deposits , $ 1 . 4 Â   billion were classified as level 1 and $ 250 Â   million were classified as level 2 . our money market fund deposits classified as level 2 consisted of our investment in the reserve primary fund . the reserve primary fund did not meet redemption requests and received approval from the securities and exchange commission to temporarily suspend payments to investors . we reclassified our investment in the reserve primary fund from level 1 to level 2 because the temporary suspension of redemptions in the reserve primary fund was in place as of as september Â   27 , 2008 ; therefore there was not an active market to meet the criteria for level 1 classification . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) equity securitiesas of september Â   27 , 2008 , our portfolio of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 401 Â   million of marketable equity securities . of these securities , $ 304 Â   million were classified as level 1 because their valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets . our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one month period prior to the valuation date for each individual security , including the number of days each individual equity security trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding shares of that security . the fair value of our investment in vmware , inc . ( $ 276 Â   million ) constituted most of the fair values of the marketable equity securities that we classified as level 1 . our investment in vmware was reclassified from level 2 to level 1 during the third quarter of 2008 due to the expiration of our transfer restriction on vmware Â ’ s stock . the remaining $ 97 Â   million of our marketable equity securities were classified as level 2 because their valuations were either based on quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets or adjusted for security specific restrictions . the fair value of our investment in micron ( $ 76 million ) constituted a substantially majority of the fair values of the marketable equity securities that we classified as level 2 . in measuring the fair value of our investment in micron , our valuation reflects a discount from the quoted market price of micron Â ’ s stock due to our investment being in a form of rights exchangeable into unregistered micron stock . as of september Â   27 , 2008 , our portfolio of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis included $ 409 Â   million of equity securities offsetting deferred compensation . all of these securities were classified as level 1 because their valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets . business outlookour future results of operations and the topics of other forward-looking statements contained in this form 10-q , including this md & a , involve a number of risks and uncertainties Â — in particular , current economic uncertainty , including the tightening of credit markets , as well as future economic conditions ; our goals and strategies ; new product introductions ; plans to cultivate new businesses ; pending divestitures or investments ; revenue ; pricing ; gross margin and costs ; capital spending ; depreciation ; r & d expenses ; marketing , general and administrative expenses ; potential impairment of investments ; our effective tax rate ; pending legal proceedings ; net gains ( losses ) from equity investments ; and interest and other , net . the current uncertainty in global economic conditions makes it particularly difficult to predict product demand , and other related matters and makes it more likely that our actual results could differ materially from our expectations . we are focusing on efforts to improve operational efficiency and reduce spending that may result in several actions that could have an impact on expense levels and gross margin . in addition to the various important factors discussed above , a number of other important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations . see the risks described in Â “ risk factors Â ” in part Â   ii , item Â   1a of this form 10-q . our expectations for the remainder of 2008 are as follows : q4 2008 Â   Â • Â   revenue : Â   Â   Â • Â   gross margin : Â   Â   Â • Â   depreciation : Â   Â   Â • Â   total spending ( research and development plus marketing , general and administrative expenses ) : Â   Â   Â • Â   restructuring and asset impairment charges : Â   Â   Â • Â   net gains ( losses ) Â   from equity investments and interest and other : Â   Â   Â • Â   tax rate : fiscal year 2008 Â   Â • Â   capital spending : Â   Â   Â • Â   r & d spending : Â   Â   Â • Â   total spending ( research and development plus marketing , general and administrative expenses ) : Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) status of business outlook and scheduled business updatewe expect that our corporate representatives will , from time to time , meet privately with investors , investment analysts , the media , and others , and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the Â “ business outlook Â ” section and elsewhere in this form 10-q , including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this form 10-q . at the same time , we will keep this form 10-q and our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site at www . intc . comas a result of the uncertainty in the current economic environment , we intend to publish a mid-quarter business update on december Â   4 , 2008 . from the close of business on november Â   28 , 2008 until publication of the update , we will observe a Â “ quiet period Â ” during which the business outlook and other forward-looking statements published in our form 8-k filed on october Â   14 , 2008 , as reiterated or updated , as applicable , in this form 10-q , should be considered historical , speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update . during the quiet period , our representatives will not comment on the business outlook or our financial results or expectations . a quiet period operating in a similar fashion with regards to the business outlook and our sec filings will begin at the close of business on december Â   12 , 2008 until our quarterly earnings release is published , presently scheduled for january Â   15 , 2009 . the exact timing and duration of our announced quiet periods , and any others that we utilize from time to time , may vary at our discretion .

Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) our overall gross margin dollars for the second quarter of 2007 decreased 8 % compared to the first quarter of 2007 and decreased 2 % compared to the second quarter of 2006 . our overall gross margin percentage for the second quarter of 2007 was 46 . 9 % , compared to 50 . 1 % in the first quarter of 2007 and 52 . 1 % in the second quarter of 2006 . the gross margin in the second quarter of 2007 decreased compared to the first quarter of 2007 primarily due to gross margin declines in the mobility group and digital enterprise group operating segments . unit sales for the second quarter of 2007 exceeded our expectations , however , gross margin came in below expectations primarily due to lower than expected average selling prices for microprocessors , chipsets , and flash memory . additionally , demand in the nor flash memory market segment was weaker than expected . the gross margin decreased compared to the second quarter of 2006 primarily due to gross margin declines in the digital enterprise group and flash memory group operating segments . overall gross margin decreased primarily due to lower microprocessor average selling prices and higher start-up costs , partially offset by higher microprocessor unit sales and lower microprocessor unit costs . chipset unit sales were strong in the second quarter of 2007 , a leading indicator of microprocessor orders in the third quarter of 2007 , and a solid second half demand environment . growth in our chipset unit sales occurred within the desktop , server , and mobile market segments . our notebook and server revenue increased by double digit percentages compared to the second quarter of 2006 . our server revenue also increased by a double digit percentage compared to the first quarter of 2007 . we have experienced , and expect to continue to experience , an overall shift in sales mix from desktop processors to mobile microprocessors . due to the wide price differences among mobile , desktop , and server microprocessors , the mix and types of performance capabilities of microprocessors sold affect the average selling price of our products and have a substantial impact on our revenue . in the server market , our quad-core intel Â ® Â ® results for the second quarter of 2007 include restructuring and asset impairment charges of $ 82 million as we continue to implement plans to increase our business efficiencies to reduce costs . our headcount has decreased by 12 , 200 employees compared to the second quarter of 2006 . spending as a percentage of revenue has decreased from 39 % in the second quarter of 2006 to 30 % in the second quarter of 2007 . additionally , our operating income has increased by 26 % from the second quarter of 2006 . our efficiency efforts have also contributed to faster factory throughput times , higher yields , and improved equipment utilization . improvements in our equipment utilization have allowed us to lower our future capital spending outlook for fiscal 2007 . improved throughput times allow us to meet customer demands with lower inventory on hand . due in part to these efficiencies and to higher unit demand , our raw materials , work in progress , and finished goods inventory levels were all down compared to the first quarter of 2007 . from a financial condition perspective , we ended the second quarter of 2007 with $ 8 . 9 Â   billion in cash and short-term investments , and returned $ 500 Â   million to stockholders through stock repurchases and $ 1 . 3 Â   billion as dividends during the first half of 2007 . other highlights & product releases Â   Â • Â   intel , stmicroelectronics n . v . and francisco partners l . p . announced an agreement to form a new independent company by combining intel Â ’ s nor flash memory business and stmicroelectronics Â ’ nor and nand flash businesses . see Â “ note 13 : pending divestiture Â ” for further discussion .

Â   Â   Â • Â   business environment Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid advances in technology and new product introductions . our ability to compete depends on our ability to improve our products and processor technologies faster than our competitors , anticipate changing customer requirements , develop and launch new products with features that customers want , and invest in technologies that will enhance our product offerings . see the risks described in Â “ risk factors Â ” in part Â   ii , item Â   1a of this form 10-q for additional discussion . strategy by business segmentthe digital enterprise group the strategy for the mobility group the strategy for the flash memory group the strategy for the digital home group the strategy for the digital health group Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) critical accounting estimatesthe methods , estimates , and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements . some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments , often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain . our most critical accounting estimates include : Â   Â • Â   the valuation of non-marketable equity investments , which impacts net gains ( losses ) Â   on equity investments when we record impairments ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities , which impact our tax provision ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets , which primarily impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record impairments of assets or accelerate their depreciation ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the valuation of inventory , which impacts gross margin ; and Â   Â   Â • Â   the valuation and recognition of share-based compensation , which impact gross margin , research and development expenses , and marketing , general and administrative expenses . below , we discuss these policies further , as well as the estimates and judgments involved . we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies , such as those for revenue recognition , including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors ; however , these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective . non-marketable equity investments . in the first quarter of 2007 , clearwire corporation became a public company and therefore is no longer considered a non-marketable equity investment . our investment in clearwire remains classified under other long-term assets . see Â “ note 8 : equity investments Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q for further discussion . non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky , and a number of these companies are likely to fail . their success is dependent on product development , market acceptance , operational efficiency , and other factors . in addition , depending on their future prospects and market conditions , they may not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations , with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings , and our investments would likely become impaired . we review our investments quarterly for indicators of impairment ; however , for non-marketable equity investments , the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would significantly harm the fair value of the investment . the indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances include : Â   Â • Â   the investee Â ’ s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the technological feasibility of the investee Â ’ s products and technologies ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the general market conditions in the investee Â ’ s industry or geographic area , including regulatory or economic changes ; Â   Â   Â • Â   factors related to the investee Â ’ s ability to remain in business , such as the investee Â ’ s liquidity , debt ratios , and the rate at which the investee is using its cash ; and Â   Â   Â • Â   the investee Â ’ s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) investments identified as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired , in which case we write down the investment to its estimated fair value . when an investee is not considered viable from a financial or technological point of view , we write off the investment , since we consider the estimated fair value to be nominal . if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount or requires a new round of equity funding to stay in operation and the new funding does not appear imminent , we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired , unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise . impairments of investments in our portfolio of non-marketable equity investments were $ 44 Â   million in the second quarter of 2007 and $ 80 Â   million for the first half of 2007 ( $ 10 Â   million in the second quarter of 2006 and $ 33 Â   million for the first half of 2006 ) . over the past twelve quarters , including the second quarter of 2007 , impairments of investments in our portfolio of non-marketable equity investments have ranged between $ 10 Â   million and $ 44 Â   million per quarter . income taxes . we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes . these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits , benefits , and deductions , and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities , which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes , as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions . significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period . we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets . if recovery is not likely , we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable . we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated condensed balance sheets . however , should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets , our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery is not probable . in addition , the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations . as a result of the implementation of fin 48 , we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process prescribed within the interpretation . the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit , including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes , if any . the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 % likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement . it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts , as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes . we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis . this evaluation is based on factors including , but not limited to , changes in facts or circumstances , changes in tax law , effectively settled issues under audit , and new audit activity . such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period . long-lived assets . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows . due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity , we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings . in addition , as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions , we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets , primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements . when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated , and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the assets , we accelerate the rate of depreciation charges in order to depreciate the assets over their new shorter useful lives . impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets were $ 14 Â   million during the second quarter of 2007 and $ 70 Â   million for the first half of 2007 ( less than $ 15 Â   million in the second quarter of 2006 and the first half of 2006 ) . over the past twelve quarters , including the second quarter of 2007 , impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets have ranged between $ 1 Â   million and $ 320 Â   million per quarter . this range includes restructuring charges for asset impairments occurring since the fourth quarter of 2006 . inventory . share-based compensation . we use implied volatility based on freely traded options in the open market , as we believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility . in determining the appropriateness of implied volatility , we considered the following : Â   Â • Â   the volume of market activity of freely traded options , and determined that there was sufficient market activity ; Â   Â • Â   the ability to reasonably match the input variables of freely traded options to those of options granted by the company , such as the date of grant and the exercise price , and determined that the input assumptions were comparable ; and Â   Â • Â   the term of freely traded options used to derive implied volatility , which is generally one to two years , and determined that the length of term was sufficient . we use the simplified calculation of expected life described in the u . s . securities and exchange commission Â ’ s staff accounting bulletin 107 ( sab 107 ) , due to differences in the vesting terms and contractual life of current option grants compared to our historical grants . if we determined that another method used to estimate expected volatility or expected life was more reasonable than our current methods , or if another method for calculating these input assumptions was prescribed by authoritative guidance , the fair value calculated for share-based awards could change significantly . in addition , the simplified calculation of expected life is only allowed under sab 107 through the end of fiscal 2007 , after which time we will use an alternate method for estimating the useful life of options granted . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) higher volatility and longer expected lives result in an increase to share-based compensation determined at the date of grant . the effect that changes in the volatility and the expected life would have on the weighted average fair value of grants and the increase in total fair value during the second quarter and the first half of 2007 is as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   q22007 Â   Â   first half 2007 Â   Â   Â   weighted Â   Â   increase in total Â   Â   weighted Â   Â   increase in total Â   Â   Â   average Â   Â   fair value1 Â   Â   average Â   Â   fair value1 Â   Â   Â   fair value Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   Â   fair value Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   as reported Â   $ 5 . 18 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   $ 5 . 24 Â   Â   Â   Â   hypothetical : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   increase expected volatility by 5 Â   percentage points2 Â   $ 5 . 93 Â   Â   $ 13 Â   Â   $ 6 . 01 Â   Â   $ 14increase expected lives by 1 Â   year Â   $ 5 . 64 Â   Â   $ 8 Â   Â   $ 5 . 70 Â   Â   $ 8 Â   Â   Â   1 Â   amounts represent the hypothetical increase in the total fair value determined at the date of grant , which is amortized over the vesting period , net of estimated forfeitures . Â   Â   2 Â   for example , an increase from 25 % as reported volatility for q2 2007 to a hypothetical 30 % volatility . in addition , sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share-based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover . quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported share-based compensation , as we recognize the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after january Â   1 , 2006 in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed . we estimate and adjust forfeiture rates based on a quarterly review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover . if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate , we make an adjustment that will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements . if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate , we make an adjustment that will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements . these adjustments affect our gross margin ; research and development expenses ; and marketing , general and administrative expenses . the effect of forfeiture adjustments in the second quarter and the first half of 2007 was insignificant . we record cumulative adjustments to the extent that the related expense is recognized in the financial statements , beginning with implementation of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) in the first quarter of 2006 . therefore , the potential impact from cumulative forfeiture adjustments will increase in future periods . the expense that we recognize in future periods could also differ significantly from the current period and from our forecasts due to adjustments in the assumed forfeiture rates .

Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) digital enterprise groupthe revenue and operating income for the digital enterprise group operating segment for the first half of 2007 and the first half of 2006 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   ytd 2007 Â   Â   ytd 2006microprocessor revenue Â   $ 7 , 026 Â   Â   $ 7 , 230chipset , motherboard , and other revenue Â   Â   2 , 371 Â   Â   Â   2 , 538 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   net revenue Â   $ 9 , 397 Â   Â   $ 9 , 768operating income Â   $ 1 , 748 Â   Â   $ 1 , 926net revenue for the digital enterprise group operating segment decreased by $ 371 Â   million , or 4 % , in the first half of 2007 compared to the first half of 2006 . the decrease in microprocessor revenue was due to lower desktop average selling prices in a competitive pricing environment , partially offset by an increase in server average selling prices and higher microprocessor unit sales . the decrease in chipset , motherboard , and other revenue was due to a decrease in communications infrastructure revenue , and to a lesser extent , lower motherboard unit sales and lower chipset revenue . operating income decreased by $ 178 Â   million , or 9 % , in the first half of 2007 compared to the first half of 2006 . the decrease in operating income was primarily due to the revenue decline . approximately $ 400 Â   million of higher start-up costs , primarily related to our 45-nanometer process technology , as well as approximately $ 180 Â   million of higher factory underutilization charges , were offset by lower operating expenses . sales of desktop microprocessor inventory that had been previously written off further offset the effect of the revenue decline . mobility groupthe revenue and operating income for the mobility group operating segment for the first half of 2007 and the first half of 2006 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   ytd 2007 Â   Â   ytd 2006microprocessor revenue Â   $ 4 , 839 Â   Â   $ 4 , 305chipset and other revenue Â   Â   1 , 764 Â   Â   Â   1 , 363 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   net revenue Â   $ 6 , 603 Â   Â   $ 5 , 668operating income Â   $ 2 , 631 Â   Â   $ 1 , 901net revenue for the mobility group operating segment increased by $ 935 Â   million , or 16 . 5 % , in the first half of 2007 compared to the first half of 2006 . microprocessor revenue increased by $ 534 million , or 12 % , in the first half of 2007 compared to the first half of 2006 , while chipset and other revenue increased significantly by $ 401 Â   million , or 29 % , in the first half of 2007 compared to the first half of 2006 . the increase in microprocessor revenue was due to higher unit sales , partially offset by lower average selling prices . the substantial majority of the increase in chipset and other revenue was due to higher revenue from sales of chipsets and cellular baseband processors , and to a lesser extent , higher revenue from sales of wireless connectivity products . operating income increased significantly by $ 730 Â   million , or 38 % , in the first half of 2007 compared to the first half of 2006 . the substantial majority of the increase in operating income was due to higher revenue . lower operating expenses were more than offset by approximately $ 200 million of higher start-up costs , primarily related to our 45-nanometer process technology . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) flash memory groupthe revenue and operating loss for the flash memory group operating segment for the first half of 2007 and the first half of 2006 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   ytd 2007 Â   Â   ytd 2006net revenue Â   $ 963 Â   Â   $ 1 , 080 Â   operating loss Â   $ ( 574 ) Â   $ ( 294 ) net revenue for the flash memory group operating segment decreased by $ 117 Â   million , or 11 % , in the first half of 2007 compared to the first half of 2006 . the decrease in revenue was due to lower average selling prices of nor flash memory products and lower nor royalties , partially offset by higher nand revenue . operating loss increased from $ 294 Â   million in the first half of 2006 to $ 574 million in the first half of 2007 . the operating loss increase was driven by lower overall revenue and higher costs related to our new nand flash memory business , partially offset by lower nor flash memory unit costs . share-based compensationshare-based compensation decreased by $ 185 Â   million to $ 521 Â   million in the first half of 2007 from $ 706 Â   million in the first half of 2006 . there were fewer options vesting in the first half of 2007 compared to the first half of 2006 . additionally , the weighted average fair value of vesting options was lower in the first half of 2007 compared to the first half of 2006 mainly attributable to a lower weighted average volatility rate and shorter option vesting life . these decreases were partially offset by lower share-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory . operating expensesoperating expenses for the first half of 2007 and the first half of 2006 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   ytd 2007 Â   Â   ytd 2006research and development Â   $ 2 , 753 Â   Â   $ 3 , 058marketing , general and administrative Â   $ 2 , 561 Â   Â   $ 3 , 237restructuring and asset impairment charges Â   $ 157 Â   Â   $ Â — amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs Â   $ 11 Â   Â   $ 29research and development . marketing , general and administrativeresearch and development along with marketing , general and administrative expenses were 30 % of net revenue in the first half of 2007 ( 37 % of net revenue in the first half of 2006 ) .

Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) interest and other , net increased to $ 349 Â   million in the first half of 2007 compared to $ 298 million in the first half of 2006 due to higher interest income as a result of higher rates and higher average investment balances . our effective income tax rate for the first half of 2007 was 14 . 3 % , compared to 28 . 3 % for the first half of 2006 . the rate for the first half of 2007 includes the reversal of previously accrued taxes of $ 481 Â   million relating to settlements with the u . s . internal revenue service ( irs ) . see Â “ note 15 : taxes Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q for further discussion . the tax rate for the first half of 2007 was also positively impacted by higher domestic manufacturing deduction benefits , research and development credits , and expected higher profits in low tax jurisdictions ; however , this was partially offset by the elimination of the tax benefit for export sales . the rate for the first half of 2006 includes a tax benefit related to non-u . s . research and development tax credits . liquidity and capital resourcesour financial condition remains strong . cash , short-term investments , fixed income debt instruments included in trading assets , and debt at the end of each period were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   june 30 , Â   Â   dec . 30 , Â   ( dollars in millions ) Â   2007 Â   Â   2006 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   cash , short-term investments and fixed income debt instruments included in trading assets Â   $ 10 , 182 Â   Â   $ 9 , 552 Â   short-term and long-term debt Â   $ 2 , 069 Â   Â   $ 2 , 028 Â   debt as % of stockholders Â ’ equity Â   Â   5 . 2 % Â   Â   5 . 5 % in summary , our cash flows were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   six months ended Â   Â   Â   june 30 , Â   Â   july 1 , Â   ( in millions ) Â   2007 Â   Â   2006 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   net cash provided by operating activities Â   $ 3 , 969 Â   Â   $ 3 , 638 Â   net cash used for investing activities Â   Â   ( 5 , 596 ) Â   Â   ( 2 , 723 ) net cash used for financing activities Â   Â   ( 262 ) Â   Â   ( 4 , 803 ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   net increase ( decrease ) Â   in cash and cash equivalents Â   $ ( 1 , 889 ) Â   $ ( 3 , 888 ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   operating activitiescash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities . the increase in cash provided by operating activities for the first half of 2007 compared to the first half of 2006 was primarily due to an increase in inventory that occurred in the first half of 2006 and higher net income for the first half of 2007 partially offset by higher purchases of trading assets for the first half of 2007 . inventories as of june Â   30 , 2007 decreased slightly compared to december Â   30 , 2006 levels , primarily due to lower microprocessor inventory partially offset by higher chipset inventory . trading assets increased compared to december Â   30 , 2006 , primarily due to purchases exceeding maturities . additionally , accounts receivable as of june 30 , 2007 decreased compared to december Â   30 , 2006 , due to lower revenue in the second quarter of 2007 . for the first half of 2007 , our two largest customers accounted for 34 % of net revenue , with one of these customers accounting for 18 % of revenue and another customer accounting for 16 % . for the first half of 2006 , these two largest customers accounted for 36 % of net revenue . additionally , these two largest customers accounted for 45 % of net accounts receivable at june Â   30 , 2007 ( 44 % at july Â   1 , 2006 ) . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) investing activitiesinvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures , the proceeds from investment maturities and disposals , and purchases and investments in non-marketable and other equity investments . the increase in cash used in investing activities in the first half of 2007 , compared to the first half of 2006 , was primarily due to an increase in purchases and a decrease in sales and maturities of available-for-sale investments , partially offset by lower capital spending . purchases and investments in non-marketable equity investments for the first half of 2007 included $ 511 Â   million for our investment in imft ( $ 790 Â   million in the first half of 2006 ) and $ 67 Â   million for our investment in im flash singapore , llp ( imfs ) . financing activitiesfinancing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases and retirement of common stock and payment of dividends to stockholders , partially offset by proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans . the lower cash used in financing activities in the first half of 2007 , compared to the first half of 2006 , was primarily due to a decrease in repurchases and retirement of common stock and an increase in proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans . for the first half of 2007 , we purchased 23 . 8 Â   million shares of common stock for $ 500 million compared to 192 . 8 Â   million shares for $ 3 . 9 Â   billion in the first half of 2006 . we base our level of stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions and this level may fluctuate from quarter to quarter . at june Â   30 , 2007 , $ 16 . 8 Â   billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization . for the first half of 2007 , proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee equity incentive plans were $ 1 . 4 Â   billion compared to $ 494 Â   million during the first half of 2006 as a result of a higher volume of employee exercises of stock options . our dividend payments were $ 1 . 3 Â   billion in the first half of 2007 , higher than the $ 1 . 2 Â   billion paid in the same period of the prior year , due to an increase from $ 0 . 10 to $ 0 . 1125 in quarterly cash dividends per common share effective for the first quarter of 2007 . liquidityduring the first half of 2007 , our level of cash declined as our cash provided by operations was less than our cash used for investing and financing activities . we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity . another potential source of liquidity is authorized borrowings , including commercial paper of up to $ 3 . 0 Â   billion . there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program during the first half of 2007 . we also have a shelf registration on file with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) Â   pursuant to which we may offer an indeterminate amount of debt , equity , and other securities . we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 Â   months , including capital expenditures for the expansion or upgrading of worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test capacity , working capital requirements , the dividend program , potential stock repurchases and potential future acquisitions or strategic investments , and cash payments associated with our restructuring plan . contractual obligationsas a result of the adoption of fin 48 , we reclassified unrecognized tax benefits to long-term income taxes payable . long-term income taxes payable includes uncertain tax positions , reduced by the associated federal deduction of state taxes and foreign tax credits , and may also include other certain long-term tax liabilities . as of june Â   30 , 2007 , we have $ 1 . 2 Â   billion of income tax liabilities . we expect to settle / make payments on approximately $ 300 Â   million of these income tax liabilities during 2007 . most of the remaining balance is expected to be settled / paid one to three years after december Â   28 , 2007 . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) business outlookour future results of operations and the other forward-looking statements contained in this form 10-q , including this md & a , involve a number of risks and uncertainties Â — in particular , the statements regarding our goals and strategies , new product introductions , plans to cultivate new businesses , pending divestitures , future economic conditions , revenue , pricing , gross margin and costs , capital spending , depreciation , research and development expenses , potential impairment of investments , the tax rate , and pending legal proceedings . our future results of operations may also be affected by the amount , type , and valuation of share-based awards granted as well as the amount of awards cancelled due to employee turnover and the timing of award exercises by employees . we are focusing on efforts to improve operational efficiency and reduce spending that may result in several actions that could have an impact on expense levels and gross margin . in addition to the various important factors discussed above , a number of other important factors could cause actual results to differ significantly from our expectations . see the risks described in Â “ risk factors Â ” in part Â   ii , item Â   1a of this form 10-q . for the third quarter of 2007 , we expect revenue to be between $ 9 . 0 Â   billion and $ 9 . 6 Â   billion , compared to our second quarter revenue of $ 8 . 7 Â   billion . the midpoint of this range would be a sequential increase of 7 % , which is consistent with seasonal patterns . our microprocessor business generally has followed a seasonal trend ; however , there can be no assurance that this trend will continue . historically , our sales of microprocessors have been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year . consumer purchases of pcs have been higher in the second half of the year , primarily due to back-to-school and holiday demand . in addition , technology purchases from businesses have tended to be higher in the second half of the year . our financial results are substantially dependent on sales of microprocessors . revenue is partly a function of the mix of types and performance capabilities of microprocessors sold , as well as the mix of chipsets , flash memory and other semiconductor products sold , all of which are difficult to forecast . because of the wide price differences among mobile , desktop , and server microprocessors , the mix of types and performance levels of microprocessors sold affects the average selling price that we will realize and has a large impact on our revenue and gross margin . revenue is affected by the timing of new intel product introductions and the demand for and market acceptance of our products ; actions taken by our competitors , including new product offerings and introductions , marketing programs and pricing pressures , and our response to such actions ; our ability to respond quickly to technological developments and to incorporate new features into our products ; and the availability of sufficient components from suppliers to meet demand . factors that could cause demand to be different from our expectations include customer acceptance of our products and our competitors products ; changes in customer order patterns , including order cancellations ; changes in the level of inventory at customers ; and changes in business and economic conditions . we expect the gross margin percentage in the third quarter of 2007 to be approximately 52 % , plus or minus a couple of points . the 52 % midpoint is higher than the gross margin of 46 . 9 % in the second quarter , primarily due to lower start-up costs related to our 45-nanometer process technology , lower microprocessor unit costs , and higher unit volumes from microprocessors and chipsets . we expect the increases to our gross margin percentage to be partially offset by lower microprocessor average selling prices and higher inventory write-offs related to pre-production of products not yet qualified for sale . our gross margin expectation for 2007 is 51 % , plus or minus a few points . our gross margin varies primarily with revenue levels . variability of other factors will also continue to affect cost of sales and the gross margin percentage , including product mix and pricing ; capacity utilization ; variations in inventory valuation , including variations related to the timing of qualifying products for sale ; excess or obsolete inventory ; manufacturing yields ; changes in unit costs ; impairment of long-lived assets , including manufacturing , assembly and test , and intangible assets ; and the timing and execution of the manufacturing ramp and associated costs , including start-up costs . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) we have continued to expand our semiconductor manufacturing and assembly and test capacity over the last few years , and we continue to plan capacity based on our overall strategy and the acceptance of our products in specific market segments . we currently expect that capital spending in 2007 will be approximately $ 4 . 9 Â   billion , plus or minus $ 200 Â   million , which is lower than our previous expectations of $ 5 . 5 Â   billion . the majority of the decrease in capital spending expectations is due to capital efficiencies from various projects , including more efficient use of tools and better yields . this capital-spending plan is dependent on expectations regarding production efficiencies and delivery times of various machinery and equipment , and construction schedules . if the demand for our products does not grow and continue to move toward higher performance products in the various market segments , revenue and gross margin would be harmed , manufacturing and assembly and test capacity would be underutilized , and the rate of capital spending could be reduced . we could be required to record an impairment of our manufacturing or assembly and test equipment and facilities , or factory-planning decisions may cause us to record accelerated depreciation . in addition , if demand for our products is reduced or we fail to accurately forecast demand , we could be required to write off inventory , which would have a negative impact on our gross margin . however , in the long term , revenue and gross margin may also be affected if we do not add capacity fast enough to meet market demand . we expect depreciation expense to be approximately $ 1 . 1 Â   billion for the third quarter of 2007 . we expect deprecation expense for the full year 2007 to be approximately $ 4 . 6 Â   billion , plus or minus $ 100 Â   million , which is lower than the previous expectation of $ 4 . 8 Â   billion due to suspended depreciation for nor flash manufacturing assets that are being held for sale . see Â “ note 13 : pending divestiture Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q for further discussion . spending on research and development , plus marketing , general and administrative expenses ( total spending ) in the third quarter of 2007 is expected to be between $ 2 . 7 Â   billion and $ 2 . 8 Â   billion , slightly higher compared to $ 2 . 6 Â   billion in the second quarter of 2007 . research and development spending in 2007 is expected to be approximately $ 5 . 7 Â   billion , which is higher than our previous expectation of approximately $ 5 . 6 Â   billion . marketing , general and administrative expenses in 2007 are expected to be approximately $ 5 . 1 Â   billion . we continue to focus on controlling our total spending through cost-saving actions . restructuring and asset impairment charges in the third quarter of 2007 are expected to be approximately $ 150 Â   million . expenses , particularly certain marketing and compensation expenses vary depending on the level of demand for our products , the level of revenue and profit , and impairments of long-lived assets . we expect the net gains from equity investments and interest and other for the third quarter of 2007 to be approximately $ 320 Â   million . our expectations for gains ( losses ) Â   from equity investments include our expectations for mergers , stock offerings , equity method income / loss , and impairment charges on public and private equity investments , and are based on our experience . it is not possible to know at the present time whether specific investments are likely to be impaired or the extent or timing of individual impairments . in addition , our expectations for gains or losses from equity investments and interest and other could vary depending on equity market levels and volatility ; gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities ; gains or losses from equity method investments ; impairment charges related to marketable , non-marketable and other investments ; interest rates , cash balances , and changes in the fair value of derivative instruments . the tax rate for the third and fourth quarters is expected to be approximately 29 % , lower than the previous expectation of approximately 31 % . the estimated effective tax rate is based on tax law in effect at june Â   30 , 2007 and current expected income . the tax rate may also be affected by the closing of acquisitions or divestitures ; changes in estimates of credits , benefits , and deductions ; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities , including payment of interest and penalties ; and the ability to realize deferred tax assets . we believe that we have the product offerings and introductions , facilities , personnel , and competitive and financial resources for continued business success , but future revenue , costs , gross margin , and profits are all influenced by a number of factors , including those discussed above , all of which are inherently difficult to forecast . Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) status of business outlook and scheduled business updatewe expect that our corporate representatives will , from time to time , meet privately with investors , investment analysts , the media and others , and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the business outlook section and elsewhere in this form 10-q , including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this form 10-q . at the same time , we will keep this form 10-q and our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site ( www . intc . com ) . the public can continue to rely on the business outlook published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered , unless we publish a notice stating otherwise . the statements in the business outlook and other forward-looking statements in this form 10-q are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and sec filings and at other times . from the close of business on september Â   14 , 2007 until our quarterly earnings release is published , presently scheduled for october Â   16 , 2007 , we will observe a Â “ quiet period . Â ” during the quiet period , the business outlook and other forward-looking statements first published in our form 8-k filed on july Â   17 , 2007 , as reiterated or updated as applicable should be considered historical , speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update . during the quiet period , our representatives will not comment on the business outlook or our financial results or expectations . the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period , and any others that we utilize , from time to time , may vary at our discretion .

< date > 2006-07-01 < / date > < price > 19 . 00 < / price > < company > intc < / company > we begin management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( md & a ) with a discussion on our use of non-gaap financial measures . we then discuss intel Â ’ s overall strategy and the strategy for our major operating segments to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the direction in which our business and products are moving . the strategy section is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results . we then discuss our results of operations , beginning with an Â “ overview . Â ” following the analysis of our results , we provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows , and discuss our financial condition in the section entitled Â “ liquidity and capital resources . Â ” we then conclude this md & a with our business outlook section , discussing our outlook for 2006 and the third quarter of 2006 . the various sections of this md & a contain a number of forward-looking statements . words such as Â “ expects , Â ” Â “ goals , Â ” Â “ plans , Â ” Â “ believes , Â ” Â “ continues , Â ” Â “ may , Â ” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements . in addition , any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance , our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses , and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements . such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in the Â “ business outlook Â ” section ( also see item Â   1a Â “ risk factors Â ” in part Â   ii of this form 10-q ) . our actual results may differ materially , and these forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures , mergers , acquisitions or other business combinations that had not been completed as of july Â   31 , 2006 . non-gaap financial measuresin addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with united states ( u . s . ) generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ) , this md & a contains non-gaap financial measures that exclude the effects of share-based compensation and the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards ( sfas ) Â   no . Â   123 ( revised 2004 ) , Â “ share-based payment Â ” ( sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) ) . the non-gaap financial measures used by management and disclosed by the company exclude the income statement effects of all forms of share-based compensation and the effects of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) upon the number of diluted common shares used in calculating non-gaap earnings per share . the non-gaap financial measures disclosed by the company should not be considered a substitute for , or superior to , financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap , and the financial results calculated in accordance with gaap and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated . the non-gaap financial measures used by the company may be calculated differently from , and therefore may not be comparable to , similarly titled measures used by other companies . the company has provided reconciliations of the non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures . the company applied the modified prospective method of adoption of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) , under which the effects of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) are reflected in the company Â ’ s gaap financial statement presentations for and after the first quarter 2006 , but are not reflected in results for prior periods . in managing the company Â ’ s business on a consolidated basis , consistent with how we managed the business prior to implementation of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) , management develops an annual budget that includes all components of the income statement , exclusive of share-based compensation . gross margin , expenses ( research and development and marketing , general and administrative ) , operating income , income taxes , net income and diluted earnings per share ( eps ) Â   are the primary consolidated financial measures management uses for planning and forecasting future periods that are affected by share-based compensation . the company Â ’ s budget and planning process commences with a segment-level evaluation which excludes share-based compensation , and culminates with the preparation of a consolidated annual and / or quarterly budget that includes these non-gaap financial measures . this budget , once finalized and approved , serves as the basis for the allocation of resources and management of operations . the number of full-time equivalent employees working in manufacturing , research and development and marketing , general and administrative related roles is determined through the budgeting process exclusive of share-based compensation . segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation charges and therefore the budget and planning process , which involves headcount planning , excludes the effects of share-based compensation . in addition , our tax strategies are determined on a consolidated basis exclusive of the expenses and related tax benefit relating to share-based compensation . the accounting expense impact of share-based compensation is not discussed nor considered when assessing and determining the appropriate level of budgeted expenses for gross margin , research and development , and marketing , general and administrative expenses . accordingly , such 19 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) amounts are also excluded from the budgeted operating income , net income and earnings per share . gaap-basis financial statements which include the effects of share-based compensation are only reviewed and analyzed for purposes of external reporting where gaap-basis financial statements are necessary . under our budget and planning process , consistent with our practice prior to the adoption of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) , when we seek to reduce unit costs with the goal of increasing gross margin , management does not consider the effects of share-based compensation . when assessing the level of research and development efforts currently or prospectively , consistent with our practice prior to the adoption of sfas no . 123 ( r ) , management does not consider the effects of share-based compensation . when making decisions about project spending , administrative budgets , or marketing programs , management does not consider the effects of share-based compensation . in addition to using the budget process for planning and resource allocation , on a quarterly basis we analyze the performance of our business on a consolidated basis by comparing our gross margin , expenses ( research and development and marketing , general and administrative ) , operating income , net income and diluted earnings per share , each excluding share-based compensation , to the prior period and forecasted amounts developed during the budget and planning process , also excluding share-based compensation . we use these quarterly assessments to evaluate the performance of the business against prior periods and budget and to develop our business outlook which we communicate to investors . consistent with our practice prior to the adoption of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) , the company Â ’ s share-based compensation programs are established and managed on a company-wide basis , including specification of grant types and amount ranges for employees by category and grade . our philosophy relative to share-based compensation programs is built on the principle that equity compensation should seek to align employees Â ’ actions and behaviors with stockholders Â ’ interest ; be market competitive ; be able to attract , motivate and retain the best employees ; and support intel Â ’ s belief in a broad-based approach . share based compensation granted to employees is in addition to , not in lieu of , cash compensation . accordingly , our share-based compensation programs are evaluated separately from the cost of our other compensation programs . specifically , our share-based compensation programs are carefully evaluated from the perspective of the resulting dilution and other metrics , and not from the resulting expense to be recorded . for example , our goal has been to keep the potential incremental dilution related to our equity incentive plans ( stock options and restricted stock units ) to a long-term average of less than 2 % annually . the dilution percentage is calculated using the new equity-based awards , net of equity-based awards cancelled due to employees leaving the company and expired stock options , divided by the total outstanding shares at the beginning of the year . further , as noted above , segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation charges , and these charges do not impact their business unit Â ’ s operating income ( loss ) . accordingly , share-based compensation charges also are excluded from the company Â ’ s measure of segment profitability ( operating income ) . therefore , when evaluating segment and operating income , management and the board of directors exclude share-based compensation . operating income and net income , both on a per-share basis , are calculated excluding share-based compensation for purposes of evaluating profit-dependent cash incentive compensation paid to employees , including senior management . for example , for 2006 the executive compensation cash incentive plan formula measures eps as the greater of ( x ) Â   intel Â ’ s operating income or ( y ) Â   intel Â ’ s net income ( in both cases excluding the effect of share-based compensation ) , divided by intel Â ’ s weighted average diluted common shares outstanding , excluding the effects of share-based compensation . the calculation of diluted common shares outstanding , excluding the effects of share-based compensation , excludes the proceeds from the remaining unamortized share-based compensation , and adjusts the proceeds from tax benefits by excluding the effects of share-based compensation . the calculation of diluted common shares outstanding , excluding the effects of share-based compensation , is similar to the calculation of diluted common shares outstanding , as reported , prior to the adoption of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) . accordingly , when budgeting for the company Â ’ s profit-dependent cash incentives , the company applies the formula above to calculate earnings per share excluding share-based compensation so as to be able to factor the appropriate amount of profit dependent cash incentive into the budget . 20 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) the company discloses this non-gaap information to the public to enable investors who wish to more easily assess the company Â ’ s performance on the same basis applied by management and to ease comparison on both a gaap and non-gaap basis to our prior period results . in particular , as the company begins to apply sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) , the company believes that it is useful to investors to understand how the expenses and other adjustments associated with the application of sfas no . 123 ( r ) are being reflected on the company Â ’ s income statements . management believes gross margin , excluding share-based compensation , research and development , excluding share-based compensation , and marketing , general , and administrative expense , excluding share-based compensation , are useful information for investors because the gaap measure when compared in isolation with 2005 would indicate a level of increase in those expenses inconsistent with actual performance . we believe that the non-gaap measures serve to provide a baseline for investors in this first year of adoption to compare actual results for the current year , excluding share-based compensation , to the prior year gaap amounts , which exclude share-based compensation . we believe this comparison also is useful to allow investors to more easily evaluate our results from a period-to-period comparability perspective . management believes operating income and net income , excluding share-based compensation , is useful information to investors because it assists investors in evaluating operating income and net income consistent with how management evaluates performance and to understand the basis for the company Â ’ s profit dependent cash incentive plan . especially in this first year of applying the provisions of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) , we believe operating and net income as reported in our income statement are not comparable to prior year period amounts , and may lead investors to believe business has declined more significantly than would be caused by actual changes in the business ( as opposed to changes in accounting treatment between years ) . when presenting net income , excluding share-based compensation , we believe it appropriate to exclude the related tax benefit recognized in the financial statements for purposes of presenting net income or eps , excluding share-based compensation . providing diluted earnings per share , excluding share-based compensation assists investors in evaluating diluted earnings per share compared to prior periods . especially in this first year of applying the provisions of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) , we believe diluted earnings per share as reported in our income statement is not comparable to prior year amounts . the basis for the company Â ’ s decision to use these non-gaap measures excluding share-based compensation is that management has determined in this first year of adoption of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) to continue to evaluate the business on the same basis as prior to the implementation of sfas no . 123 ( r ) until there is greater familiarity with its effects and until the second year after adoption of sfas unlike other forms of compensation , share-based compensation was not recognized prior to january Â   1 , 2006 when we adopted the provisions of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) . additionally , when management determines the annual merit and promotional budget for compensation , the effects of share-based compensation on the company Â ’ s financial statements are not considered . rather share-based awards are generally granted via a fixed formula depending on position and level of the employee . in addition , segment managers are held accountable for other forms of compensation , and as such those compensation charges are included in the segments Â ’ results and in the budget and planning processes of our reporting segments . 21 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) a material limitation associated with the use of these measures as compared to the related gaap measures is that they may reduce comparability with other companies who may use different types of equity incentive awards , or whose compensation structures may use share-based compensation to a greater or lesser extent as part of their overall compensation . these differences may cause our non-gaap measures excluding share-based compensation to not be comparable to other companies Â ’ non-gaap measures excluding share-based compensation . other material limitations associated with the use of these measures as compared to the gaap comparable measure include : gross margin , excluding share-based compensation , does not include all costs related to the cost of inventory sold during the period ; research and development , excluding share-based compensation , does not include all costs related to the research and development needed to bring new products to the market ; marketing , general and administrative expenses , excluding share-based compensation , does not include all costs related to the marketing , general and administrative efforts required to manage our company and sell our products . a material limitation with using operating income , excluding share-based compensation , net income , excluding share-based compensation , and diluted earnings per share , excluding share-based compensation , is that they do not include all costs typically included in the presentation of the comparable gaap measure , and they may not include all costs related to hiring and retaining qualified employees . although these non-gaap financial measures adjust cost , expenses and diluted share items to exclude the accounting treatment of share-based compensation , they should not be viewed as a pro forma presentation reflecting the elimination of the underlying share-based compensation programs . thus , our non-gaap presentations are not intended to present , and should not be used , as a basis for assessing what our operating results might be if we were to eliminate our share-based compensation programs . our equity incentive plans are an important element of the company Â ’ s compensation structure and gaap indicates that all forms of share-based payments should be valued and included as appropriate in results of operations . because of the foregoing limitations , management does not intend to use the non-gaap financial measures when assessing the company Â ’ s performance against that of other companies . the company manages its share-based compensation programs in the aggregate against certain metrics rather than reviewing financial statement impacts by financial statement line item . specifically , our goal has been to keep the potential incremental dilution related to our equity incentive plans ( stock options and restricted stock units ) to a long-term average of less than 2 % annually . the dilution percentage is calculated using the new equity-based awards , net of equity-based awards cancelled due to employees leaving the company and expired stock options , divided by the total outstanding shares at the beginning of the year . strategyour goal is to be the preeminent provider of silicon chips and platform solutions to the worldwide digital economy . as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment , we use our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits , as well as

end-user solution than if the ingredients were used separately . our platforms consist of various products based on standards and initiatives ; hardware and software that may include technologies such as hyper-threading technology ( ht technology ) , intel Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® 22 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) we also believe that users of computing and communications systems and devices want improved overall performance and / or improved performance per watt . improved overall performance can include faster processing performance and / or other improved capabilities such as multithreading and / or multitasking , and improved connectivity , security , manageability , utilization , reliability , ease of use and / or interoperability among devices . improved performance per watt involves balancing the addition of these types of improved performance factors with the power consumption of the platform . lower power consumption may reduce system heat output , provide power savings , and reduce the total cost of ownership for the end user . it is our goal to incorporate these improvements in our various products and platforms to meet end-user demands . in line with these efforts , we are focusing our efforts on multi-core microprocessors . multi-core microprocessors contain two or more processor cores , rather than just one processor core , which enables improved multitasking with improved performance per watt . in line with our efforts to improve overall performance , we will continue to invest in developing next-generation microarchitectures for microprocessors . the recent development of our new intel Â ® tmwe make equity investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives , including investments through our intel capital program . we generally focus on investing in companies and initiatives to stimulate growth in the

on intel Â ’ s worldwide presence and success in global markets by accelerating channel growth . in addition , the channel platforms group is developing unique platform solutions designed to meet local market needs in certain geographies . critical accounting estimatesthe methods , estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements , which we discuss under the heading Â “ results of operations Â ” following this section of our md & a . some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments , often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain . our most critical accounting estimates include the valuation of non-marketable equity securities , which impacts net gains ( losses ) Â   on equity securities when we record impairments ; recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities , which impact our tax provision ; assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets , which primarily impacts gross margin when we impair manufacturing assets or accelerate their depreciation ; valuation of inventory , which impacts gross margin ; and valuation and recognition of share-based compensation , which impacts gross margin , research and development expenses , and marketing , general and administrative expenses . below , we discuss these policies further , as well as the estimates and judgments involved . we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies , such as policies for revenue recognition , including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors ; however , these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective . non-marketable equity securities . 26 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) investments in non-marketable equity securities are inherently risky , and a number of these companies are likely to fail . their success is dependent on product development , market acceptance , operational efficiency and other key business success factors . in addition , depending on their future prospects , they may not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations , with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings , and the investments would likely become impaired . we review our investments quarterly for indicators of impairment ; however , for non-marketable equity securities , the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment . the indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances include ( a ) Â   the investee Â ’ s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects , ( b ) Â   the technological feasibility of the investee Â ’ s products and technologies , ( c ) Â   the general market conditions in the investee Â ’ s industry or geographic area , including adverse regulatory or economic changes , ( d ) Â   factors related to the investee Â ’ s ability to remain in business , such as the investee Â ’ s liquidity , debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash , and ( e ) Â   the investee Â ’ s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation . to assess indicators of impairment related to our investment in imft we generally apply the above indicators to our nand business versus only the investee . investments identified as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired , in which case we write the investment down to its estimated fair value . when an investee is not considered viable from a financial or technological point of view , we write down the entire investment since we consider the estimated fair market value to be nominal . if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount or requires a new round of equity funding to stay in operation and the new funding does not appear imminent , we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired , unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise . with respect to our investment in imft , if indicators of impairment exist , we would determine the fair value of our nand business using the income method which is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses assumptions we believe marketplace participants would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows . our estimates are based on historical data , various internal estimates and a variety of external sources , and are developed as part of our routine long-range planning process . impairments of investments in our portfolio of non-marketable equity securities were $ 10 Â   million in the second quarter of 2006 and $ 33 Â   million for first half of 2006 ( $ 28 Â   million in the second quarter of 2005 and $ 43 Â   million for first half of 2005 ) . over the past twelve quarters , impairments of investments in our portfolio of non-marketable equity securities have ranged between $ 10 Â   million and $ 92 million per quarter . income taxes . we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets . if recovery is not likely , we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable . we believe that a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be recovered . however , should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets , our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely . in addition , the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations . we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the u . s . and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether , and the extent to which , additional tax payments are probable . if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary , we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary . we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be . 27 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) in june Â   2006 , the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) Â   issued fasb interpretation number 48 ( fin 48 ) , Â “ accounting for uncertainty in income taxes Â – an interpretation of sfas no . Â   109 . Â ” the interpretation contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no . Â   109 . the provisions are effective beginning in the first quarter of 2007 . we are currently evaluating the impact fin 48 will have on our consolidated financial statements . see Â “ note 2 : recent accounting pronouncements Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q for further discussion . long-lived assets . impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows . due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity , we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings . in addition , as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions , we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets , primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements . when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated , and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the assets , we accelerate the rate of depreciation charges in order to fully depreciate the assets over their new shorter useful lives . impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets were less than $ 15 Â   million during the second quarter of 2006 and the first half of 2006 , and for the same periods during 2005 . over the past twelve quarters , impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets have ranged between $ 2 Â   million and $ 45 Â   million per quarter . inventory . share-based compensation . determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock purchase plans at the date of grant requires judgment . we use the black-scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of these share-based awards consistent with the provisions of sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) . option pricing models , including the black-scholes model , also require the use of input assumptions , including expected volatility , expected life , expected dividend rate , and expected risk-free rate of return . the assumptions for expected volatility and expected life are the two assumptions that significantly affect the grant date fair value . the expected dividend rate and expected risk-free rate of return are not significant to the calculation of fair value . 28 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) we use implied volatility based on options freely traded in the open market as we believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility . in determining the appropriateness of implied volatility , we considered : the volume of market activity of freely traded options , and determined there was sufficient market activity ; the ability to reasonably match the input variables of options freely traded to those of options granted by the company , such as date of grant and the exercise price , and determined the input assumptions were comparable ; and the length of term of freely traded options used to derive implied volatility , which is generally 1 to 2 Â   years , and determined the length of term was sufficient . we use the simplified calculation of expected life described in the securities and exchange commission Â ’ s ( sec ) Â   staff accounting bulletin 107 , due to changes in the vesting terms and contractual life of current option grants compared to our historical grants . if we determined another method to estimate expected volatility or expected life was more reasonable than our current methods , or if another method for calculating these input assumptions was prescribed by authoritative guidance , the fair value calculated for share-based awards could change significantly . higher volatility and expected lives result in an increase to share-based compensation determined at the date of grant . the effect that changes in the volatility and expected lives would have on the weighted average fair value of grants and the increase in total fair value during the second quarter and the first half of 2006 is as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   q22006 Â   Â   first half 2006 Â   Â   Â   weighted Â   Â   increase in total Â   Â   weighted Â   Â   increase in total Â   Â   Â   average Â   Â   fair value1 Â   Â   average Â   Â   fair value1 Â   Â   Â   fair value Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   Â   fair value Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   as reported Â   $ 5 . 07 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   $ 5 . 15 Â   Â   Â   Â   hypothetical : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   increase expected volatility by 5 Â   percentage points2 Â   $ 5 . 74 Â   Â   $ 24 Â   Â   $ 5 . 84 Â   Â   $ 29increase expected lives by 1 Â   year Â   $ 5 . 53 Â   Â   $ 17 Â   Â   $ 5 . 62 Â   Â   $ 20 Â   1 Â   amounts represent the hypothetical increase in the total fair value determined at the date of grant , which is amortized over the vesting period , net of estimated forfeitures . Â   2 Â   for example , an increase from 27 % as reported volatility for q2 2006 to a hypothetical 32 % volatility . in addition , sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share-based awards which will be forfeited due to employee turnover . quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported share-based compensation , as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after january Â   1 , 2006 is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed . if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate , then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate , which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements . if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate , then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate , which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements . these adjustments affect our gross margin , research and development expenses , and marketing , general , administrative expenses . the effect of forfeiture adjustments in the second quarter and the first half of 2006 was insignificant . cumulative adjustments are only recorded to the extent the related expense is recognized in the financial statements , beginning with implementation in the first quarter of 2006 . therefore , we expect the potential impact from cumulative forfeiture adjustments to increase in future periods . the expense we recognize in future periods could also differ significantly from the current period and / or our forecasts due to adjustments in the assumed forfeiture rates . 29 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) results of operationsoverviewin the second quarter of 2006 , revenue declined 10 % compared to the first quarter of 2006 , and declined 13 % from the second quarter of 2005 . in addition , our gross margin dollars have declined to $ 4 . 2 Â   billion in the second quarter of 2006 , compared to $ 4 . 9 Â   billion in the first quarter of 2006 and $ 5 . 2 Â   billion in the second quarter of 2005 . these declines were primarily due to significantly lower average selling prices and a slightly softer overall market for microprocessors in a strong competitive environment . in addition , we believe sales in the second quarter were negatively impacted by our customers working through excess inventories . a substantial majority of our revenue and gross margin continues to be dependent on the sale of microprocessors . in response to the competitive environment , we have significantly lowered the pricing on our microprocessors . with the transition to our new intel core microarchitecture lineup , we believe we are well positioned to remain competitive , improve our competitive position and our overall business . we are currently shipping desktop , mobile , and server microprocessors based on this new microarchitecture , which use our industry-leading 65-nanometer process technology on 300-millimeter wafers . these new processors are showing top benchmarking results in performance per watt over the competition . the ramp of these products and their higher unit costs have contributed to a significant increase in our inventory dollars , however , we believe that the inventory levels are appropriate for the business based on our current forecasts . looking forward to the second half we believe our customers have reduced their inventory levels and we are looking for approximately seasonal increases in revenue . in addition , we continue our focus on reducing spending and increasing our efficiency . we have finalized our plans to reduce 2006 spending by a billion dollars and are continuing the comprehensive structural review of our company that we announced in april . in line with these efforts , we have announced the planned sale of our applications processor business to marvell , and recently announced the elimination of 1 , 000 management positions throughout the company . we plan to continue announcing further actions as the review progresses . these plans and the resulting reduction in spending have not affected our plans for our next generation of processes and products including our next generation 45-nanometer process technology . second quarter of 2006 compared to second quarter of 2005the

significantly lower microprocessor average selling prices . lower microprocessor unit sales also contributed to the decrease . revenue in our asia-pacific region decreased 14 % , revenue in our europe region decreased 24 % and revenue in our americas region decreased 8 % compared to q2 2005 . japan revenue increased 3 % compared to q2 2005 . there were declines in q2 2006 compared to q2 2005 in both the emerging and mature markets with most of the decrease in both markets occurring in the asia-pacific and europe regions . 31 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition

percentage decreased to 52 . 1 % in q2 2006 , down from 56 . 4 % in q2 2005 . the gross margin percentage for the mobility group and the digital enterprise group were lower in q2 2006 compared to q2 2005 . additionally , gross margin in q2 2006 includes the impact of share-based compensation . a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars and operating profit in q2 2006 and q2 2005 was derived from the sale of microprocessors . see Â “ business outlook Â ” for a discussion of gross margin expectations . digital enterprise groupthe revenue and operating income for the digital

average selling prices and lower desktop microprocessor unit sales each contributed equally to the decrease in microprocessor revenue . lower chipset revenue and significantly lower motherboard unit sales each contributed equally to the decrease in chipset , motherboard , and other revenue . microprocessors within the digital enterprise group include microprocessors designed for the desktop and enterprise computing market segments as well as embedded microprocessors . revenue from network processors , which are based on our intel xscale technology , is included in Â “ chipset , motherboard and other revenue Â ” above . operating income decreased significantly by $ 1 . 1 Â   billion , or 54 % , in q2 2006 compared to q2 2005 . a substantial majority of the decrease was due to lower microprocessor revenue . higher operating expenses in q2 2006 were more than offset by approximately $ 270 Â   million of lower start-up costs in q2 2006 . mobility groupthe revenue and operating income for the mobility group operating segment for the second quarter of 2006 and 2005 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   q22006 Â   Â   q22005 Â

microprocessor unit sales , and to a lesser extent , higher revenue from sales of chipsets in q2 2006 . these increases were largely offset by lower microprocessor average selling prices . revenue from applications processors , which are based on our intel xscale technology , is included in Â “ chipset and other revenue Â ” above . in the second quarter of 2006 , we entered into an agreement to sell the business line that includes application and cellular baseband processors used in handheld devices . see Â “ note 12 : pending divestitures Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial

loss Â   $ ( 149 ) Â   $ ( 80 ) net revenue for the flash memory group operating segment was approximately flat in q2 2006 compared to q2 2005 with higher unit sales partially offset by lower average selling prices . we began shipping nand flash memory products manufactured by imft in 2006 . operating loss increased from $ 80 million in q2 2005 to $ 149 Â   million in q2 2006 . the increase was primarily due to higher operating expenses and spending related to nand products . the effect of lower average selling prices was offset by lower unit costs . share-based compensationshare-based compensation totaled $ 332 Â   million in q2 2006 , compared to zero in q2 2005 . we adopted the modified prospective transition method under sfas no . Â   123 ( r ) , effective beginning in the first quarter 2006 . prior to adoption of sfas no .

Â   25 , Â “ accounting for stock issued to employees Â ” ( apb 25 ) , and related interpretations . accordingly , no share-based compensation , other than insignificant amounts of acquisition-related share-based compensation , was recognized in net income . as of july Â   1 , 2006 , there was $ 1 . 7 Â   billion of unrecognized share-based compensation costs related to stock options . the unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1 . 1 Â   years . in the second quarter of 2006 , we began issuing restricted stock units to employees . as of july Â   1 , 2006 , there was $ 420 Â   million of unrecognized compensation costs related to restricted stock units . the unrecognized compensation cost related to

operations ( continued ) research and development spending increased $ 320 Â   million , or 27 % , in q2 2006 compared to q2 2005 . this increase was due to share-based compensation of $ 126 Â   million , higher headcount , and higher development costs for next-generation process technology . marketing , general and administrative expenses increased $ 251 Â   million , or 19 % , in q2 2006 compared to q2 2005 due to share-based compensation of $ 140 Â   million and higher headcount . research and development along with marketing , general and administrative expenses were 39 % of net revenue in q2 2006 ( 27 % of net revenue in q2 2005 ) . amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs was $ 10 Â   million in q2 2006 compared to $ 36 Â   million in q2 2005 , as a portion of the intangibles related to prior acquisitions became fully amortized . gains ( losses ) on equity securities , interest and other and taxesgains ( losses ) Â   on equity securities , net , interest and other , net and taxes for the second quarter of 2006 and 2005 were as follows : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( in millions ) Â   q22006 Â   Â   q22005 Â   gains ( losses ) Â   on equity securities , net Â   $ 37 Â   Â   $ ( 22 ) interest and other , net Â   $ 144 Â   Â   $ 127 Â   provision for taxes Â   $ 368 Â   Â   $ 716 Â   net gains on equity securities and certain equity derivatives for q2 2006 were $ 37 Â   million compared to net losses of $ 22 Â   million for q2 2005 . the net gain in q2 2006 was primarily due to lower impairment charges on investments of equity securities ( $ 10 Â   million in q2 2006 and $ 133 Â   million in q2 2005 ) . the impairment charges in 2005 primarily represent a $ 105 Â   million impairment charge on our investment in micron reflecting the difference between the cost basis of the investment and the price of micron Â ’ s stock at the end of the second quarter of 2005 . the impairment was principally based on our assessment during the second quarter of 2005 of micron Â ’ s financial results and the fact that the market price of micron Â ’ s stock had been below our cost basis for an extended period of time , as well as the competitive pricing environment for dynamic random access memory ( dram ) products . gains on equity transactions more than offset the impairments in 2006 and partially offset the impairments in 2005 . interest and other , net increased to $ 144 Â   million in q2 2006 compared to $ 127 Â   million in q2 2005 , reflecting higher interest income as a result of higher rates , partially offset by lower cash balances . our effective income tax rate for q2 2006 was 29 . 4 % , compared to 26 . 0 % for q2 2005 . the rate for q2 2005 included a reduction in the effective tax rate for a reversal of previously accrued taxes of $ 125 Â   million primarily related to an increase in estimated u . s . research and development tax credits from years prior to 2005 . to a lesser extent , two items increased the rate for q2 2006 : the suspension of the u . s . research and development credit and the impact of share-based compensation . these increases were partially offset by a higher percentage of profits in lower tax jurisdictions in 2006 compared to 2005 . the impact on the tax rate related to the tax benefits for export sales which is being phased-out through the end of 2006 , was not significant given the decrease in income before taxes . 34 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) results of operations Â – first

was due to significantly lower microprocessor average selling prices . to a lesser extent , lower microprocessor unit sales also contributed to the decrease . the first half of 2006 included 26 Â   weeks in contrast to 27 Â   weeks in the first half of 2005 . revenue in our europe region decreased 21 % , revenue in our asia-pacific region decreased 8 % and revenue in our americas region decreased 6 % compared to the first half of 2005 . these decreases were partially offset by revenue in japan , which increased 6 % compared to the first half of 2005 . there were declines in the first half of 2006 compared to the first half of 2005 in both the emerging and mature markets . the decrease within mature markets occurred within the europe and asia-pacific regions . our overall gross margin dollars decreased to $ 9 . 1 Â   billion for the first half of 2006 , a decrease of 16 % compared to $ 10 . 8 Â   billion for the first half of 2005 . our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 53 . 8 % for the first half of 2006 , down from 57 . 9 % for the first half of 2005 . the gross margin percentage for the digital enterprise group and the mobility group were both lower in the first half of 2006 compared to the first half of 2005 . partially offsetting these decreases , the overall gross margin percentage was positively affected by a mix shift of our total revenue to the mobility group , which has a higher gross margin percentage . a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars and operating profit in the first half of 2006 and the first half of 2005 was derived from the sale of microprocessors . see Â “ business outlook Â ” for a discussion of gross margin expectations . digital enterprise groupthe revenue and operating income for deg for the

microprocessor unit sales and lower microprocessor average selling prices each contributed equally to the significant decline in microprocessor revenue . a substantial majority of the decline in chipset , motherboard , and other revenue was attributable to significantly lower motherboard unit sales . to a lesser extent , lower chipset revenue also contributed to the decrease . 36 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) operating income decreased significantly by $ 2 . 1 Â   billion , or 48 % , in the first half of 2006 compared to the first half of 2005 . a substantial majority of the decrease was due to lower revenue . to a lesser extent , increased write-downs of chipset inventory also contributed to the decrease . higher operating expenses were more than offset by approximately $ 460 Â   million of lower startup costs in the first half of 2006 . mobility groupthe revenue and operating income for mg

revenue for the mobility group operating segment increased by $ 612 Â   million , or 12 % , in the first half of 2006 compared to the first half of 2005 . this increase in microprocessor revenue was primarily due to higher unit sales , partially offset by lower average selling prices . the majority of the increase in chipset and other revenue was due to higher revenue from sales of chipsets , and to a lesser extent , higher revenue from sales of wireless connectivity products . sales of these products increased primarily due to the success of intel centrino mobile technology . revenue from application processors , which are based on our intel xscale technology , is included in Â “ chipset and other revenue Â ” above . in the second quarter of 2006 , we entered into an agreement to sell the business line that includes application and cellular baseband processors used in handheld devices . see Â “ note 12 : pending divestitures Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q . this business line does not have a significant impact on the results of operations of the mobility group . operating income decreased $ 250 Â   million , or 11 % , in the first half of 2006 compared to the first half of 2005 . the decline was primarily caused by an increase in operating expenses , and to a lesser extent , higher write-down of inventory . a majority of the decline was offset by the effects of higher revenue , and to a lesser extent , by approximately $ 170 Â   million of lower start up costs in the first half of 2006 . flash memory groupthe

slightly by $ 25 Â   million , or 2 % , in the first half of 2006 compared to first half of 2005 . this decrease was primarily due to lower average selling prices , partially offset by higher unit sales and higher royalty receipts . we began shipping nand flash memory products manufactured by imft in the first half of 2006 . operating loss increased from $ 112 Â   million in the first half of 2005 to $ 253 Â   million in the first half of 2006 . the increase was primarily due to higher operating expenses . higher spending related to nand products also contributed to the increase . the effect of lower average selling prices was offset by lower unit costs . 37 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) share-based

of 2006 included impairments of $ 33 Â   million . the net loss for the first half of 2005 included impairments of $ 148 Â   million , primarily due to a $ 105 Â   million impairment charge on our investment in micron . gains on equity transactions more than offset the impairments for the first half of 2006 and partially offset the impairments for the first half of 2005 . interest and other , net increased to $ 298 Â   million in the first half of 2006 compared to $ 242 million in the first half of 2005 , reflecting higher interest income as a result of higher interest rates , partially offset by lower cash balances . our effective income tax rate remained relatively flat at 28 . 3 % for the first half of 2006 , compared to 28 . 6 % for the first half of 2005 . factors reducing the rate in the first half of 2006 included a higher percentage of profits in lower tax jurisdictions , and an increase in non-u . s . research and development tax credits . mostly offsetting these factors was the impact of the reversal of previously accrued taxes of $ 125 Â   million . to a lesser extent , the suspension of the u . s . research and development credit and the impact of share-based compensation increased the rate in the first half of 2006 . the impact on the tax rate related to the tax benefits for export sales , which is being phased-out through the end of 2006 ,

the first half of 2005 , the largest contribution to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was from lower net income , partially offset by the impacts of share-based compensation , and the timing and changes in the amount of estimated tax payments . inventories increased compared to december Â   2005 levels as we continue to ramp new products , primarily related to microprocessors on the 65 nanometer process and associated chipsets . additionally , accounts receivable decreased compared to december Â   31 , 2005 , primarily driven by lower revenue . for the first half of 2006 ,

15 % . for the first half of 2005 , these two largest customers accounted for approximately 35 % of net revenue . additionally , these two largest customers accounted for approximately 44 % of net accounts receivable at july Â   1 , 2006 ( approximately 42 % at december Â   31 , 2005 ) . investing activitiesinvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures , the proceeds from investment maturities and payment for investments acquired . the increase in cash used in investing activities in the first half of 2006 , compared to the first half of 2005 , was primarily due to our investment in imft . during the first half of 2006 , we paid $ 790 Â   million in cash for our investment in imft . our remaining $ 291 Â   million in notes and additional $ 115 Â   million owed in cash to imft have been reflected as a non-cash item on the statement of cash flows . net maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments were lower in the first half of 2006 compared to the first half of 2005 as result of lower overall investment balances primarily due to lower cash from operations . capital spending increased to $ 3 . 5 Â   billion in the first half of 2006 compared to $ 3 . 2 Â   billion in the first half of 2005 , primarily driven by investments in 45 nanometer construction and 65 nanometer production equipment . capital spending for 2006 is expected to be $ 6 . 2 Â   billion , plus or minus $ 200 Â   million , primarily for investments in 45 nanometer construction and production equipment . other investing activities for the first half of 2006 included the purchase of intellectual property assets from micron , concurrent with the formation of imft , for $ 230 Â   million . financing activitiesfinancing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases and retirement of common stock and payment of dividends to stockholders . the lower cash used in financing activities in the first half of 2006 , compared to the first half of 2005 , was primarily due to lower repurchases and retirement of common stock . for the first half of 2006 , we purchased 192 . 8 Â   million shares of common stock for $ 3 . 9 billion compared to 206 . 8 Â   million shares for $ 5 . 0 Â   billion in the first half of 2005 . at july Â   1 , 2006 , $ 17 . 9 Â   billion remained available for repurchase under existing repurchase authorizations . our dividend payments were $ 1 . 2 Â   billion in the first half of 2006 , higher than the $ 990 Â   million paid in the same period of the prior year , due to an increase from $ 0 . 08 to $ 0 . 10 in cash dividends per common share effective for the first quarter of 2006 . additional financing activities for the first half of 2006 also included proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee equity incentive plans of $ 494 Â   million ( $ 702 Â   million during the first half of 2005 ) . liquidityduring the first half of 2006 , our level of cash declined as our cash provided by operations was less than our cash used for investing and financing activities . cash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity . another potential source of liquidity is authorized borrowings , including commercial paper , of $ 3 . 0 Â   billion . there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program during the first half of 2006 . we also have an automatic shelf registration on file with the sec pursuant to which we may offer an indeterminate amount of debt , equity and other securities . 40 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 Â   months , including capital expenditures for the expansion or upgrading of worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test capacity , working capital requirements , the dividend program , potential stock repurchases and potential future acquisitions or strategic investments . in june Â   2006 , we entered into an agreement to pay $ 600 Â   million for an equity investment in clearwire corporation . the $ 600 million commitment will likely be paid in the third quarter of 2006 . employee equity incentive plansour equity incentive plans are broad-based , long-term retention programs that are intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests . in may Â   2006 , stockholders approved the 2006 equity incentive plan ( the 2006 plan ) . the new equity incentive plan replaced the 2004 equity incentive plan , which was terminated early . under the 2006 plan , 175 million shares of common stock were made available for issuance as equity awards to employees and non-employee directors through june Â   30 , 2008 , of which a maximum of 80 Â   million shares can be awarded as restricted stock or restricted stock units . additionally , in may Â   2006 , stockholders approved the 2006 stock purchase plan . under the 2006 stock purchase plan , 240 Â   million shares of common stock were made available for issuance through august Â   2011 . the 1976 stock participation plan and any remaining shares available for issuance will be cancelled as of the plan Â ’ s expiration in august Â   2006 . our goal has been to keep the potential incremental dilution related to our equity incentive plans to a long-term average of less than 2 % annually . the dilution percentage is calculated using the new equity-based awards , net of equity-based awards1equity-based awards1 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â

Â   123 ( r ) , which was adopted as of the first quarter of 2006 . 41 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) in accordance with a policy established by the compensation committee of the board of directors , total equity-based awards granted to the listed officers may not exceed 5 % of total equity-based awards granted in any year . for the first half of 2006 , equity-based awards granted to listed officers amounted to 1 . 9 % of the grants made to all employees . all equity-based awards granted to executive officers are determined by the compensation committee . all members of the compensation committee are independent directors , as defined in the applicable rules for issuers traded on the nasdaq stock market * . for additional information regarding equity incentive plans and the activity for the first six months of 2006 and for 2005 , see Â “ note 3 : employee equity incentive plans Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q . information regarding our equity incentive plans should be read in conjunction with the information appearing under the heading Â “ report of the compensation committee on executive compensation Â ” in our 2006 proxy statement . business outlookour future results of operations and the other forward-looking statements contained in this form 10-q , including this md & a , involve a number of risks and uncertainties Â — in particular , the statements regarding our goals and strategies , new product introductions , plans to cultivate new businesses , future economic conditions , revenue , pricing , gross margin and costs , capital spending , depreciation and amortization , research and development expenses , potential impairment of investments , the tax rate , and pending tax and legal proceedings . our future results of operations may also be affected by the amount , type , and valuation of share-based awards granted as well as the amount of awards cancelled due to employees leaving the company and the timing of award exercises by employees . in addition to the various important factors discussed above , a number of other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations . see the risks described in Â “ risk factors Â ” in part Â   ii , item Â   1a of this form 10-q . for the third quarter of 2006 , we expect revenue to be between $ 8 . 3 Â   billion and $ 8 . 9 Â   billion , compared to second quarter revenue of $ 8 . 0 Â   billion . the midpoint of this range would be a sequential increase of 7 . 5 % , which is consistent with seasonal patterns . revenue for the fourth quarter is expected to also follow normal seasonal patterns . our microprocessor business generally has followed a seasonal trend ; however , there can be no assurance that this trend will continue . historically , our sales of microprocessors have been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year . consumer purchases of pcs have been higher in the second half of the year , primarily due to back-to-school and holiday demand . in addition , technology purchases from businesses have tended to be higher in the second half of the year . our financial results , particularly our revenue , are substantially dependent on sales of microprocessors . revenue is partly a function of the mix of types and performance capabilities of microprocessors sold , as well as the mix of chipsets , flash memory and other semiconductor products sold , all of which are difficult to forecast . because of the wide price differences among mobile , desktop and server microprocessors , the mix of types and performance levels of microprocessors sold affects the average selling price that we will realize and has a large impact on our revenue and gross margin . revenue is affected by the timing of new intel product introductions and the demand for and market acceptance of our products , as well as actions taken by our competitors , including new product offerings , marketing programs and pricing pressures and our reaction to such actions . microprocessor revenue is also dependent on the availability of other parts of the platform , including chipsets , motherboards , operating system software and application software . revenue is also subject to demand fluctuations and the impact of economic conditions in various geographic regions . we expect the gross margin percentage in the third quarter of 2006 to be approximately 49 % , plus or minus a couple of points . excluding the effects of share-based compensation of approximately 1 % , our gross margin expectation for the third quarter of 2006 is 50 % plus or minus a couple of points . on a gaap basis , the 49 % midpoint is lower than the gross margin of 52 . 1 % in the second quarter . the lower gross margin is primarily due to higher microprocessor unit costs as we continue to ramp production of dual-core products and lower average selling prices , partially offset by higher unit sales . our gross margin expectation for 2006 is 51 % , plus or minus a few points . excluding the effects of share-based compensation of approximately 1 % , our gross margin expectation for 2006 is 52 % , plus or minus a few points . on a gaap basis , the 51 % midpoint is below our previous expectation primarily due to lower microprocessor average selling prices . 42 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) our gross margin varies primarily with revenue levels . variability of other factors will also continue to affect cost of sales and the gross margin percentage , including product mix and pricing ; variations in inventory valuation , including variations related to the timing of qualifying products for sale ; excess or obsolete inventory ; manufacturing yields ; changes in unit costs ; capacity utilization ; impairment of long-lived assets , including manufacturing , assembly and test , and intangible assets ; and the timing and execution of the manufacturing ramp and associated costs , including start-up costs . we have significantly expanded our semiconductor manufacturing and assembly and test capacity over the last few years , and we continue to plan capacity based on our overall strategy and the acceptance of our products in specific market segments . we currently expect that capital spending in 2006 will be approximately $ 6 . 2 Â   billion , plus or minus $ 200 Â   million . this capital-spending plan is dependent on expectations regarding production efficiencies and delivery times of various machinery and equipment , and construction schedules . if the demand for our products does not grow and continues to move toward higher performance products in the various market segments , revenue and gross margin would be adversely affected , manufacturing and / or assembly and test capacity would be under-utilized , and the rate of capital spending could be reduced . we could be required to record an impairment of our manufacturing or assembly and test equipment and / or facilities , or factory planning decisions may cause us to record accelerated depreciation . however , in the long term , revenue and gross margin may also be affected if we do not add capacity fast enough to meet market demand . in addition , if demand for our products is reduced or we fail to accurately forecast demand , we could be required to write down inventory , which would have a negative impact on our gross margin . we expect depreciation expense to be between $ 1 . 1 Â   billion and $ 1 . 2 Â   billion for the third quarter of 2006 and approximately $ 4 . 7 Â   billion , plus or minus $ 100 Â   million for the full year 2006 . spending on research and development , plus marketing , general and administrative expenses ( total spending ) in 2006 is expected to be approximately $ 12 . 1 Â   billion . excluding the effects of share-based compensation of approximately $ 1 . 1 Â   billion , total spending is expected to be approximately $ 11 . 0 Â   billion . total spending in the third quarter of 2006 is expected to be approximately $ 3 . 0 Â   billion . excluding the effects of share-based compensation of approximately $ 300 million , total spending in the third quarter is expected to be approximately $ 2 . 7 Â   billion . on a gaap basis , the expectation for total spending in the third quarter is slightly lower than $ 3 . 1 billion in the second quarter . we continue to focus on controlling our future total spending through cost savings actions . in addition , we are in the midst of a structure and efficiency review which may result in further actions that could have an affect on these expense levels . see Â “ overview Â ” within Â “ results of operations Â ” for further discussion regarding these actions . expenses , particularly certain marketing and compensation expenses , vary depending on the level of demand for our products and the level of revenue and profit . research and development spending in 2006 is expected to be approximately $ 6 . 0 Â   billion . excluding the effects of share-based compensation of approximately $ 500 Â   million , spending for research and development in 2006 is expected to be approximately $ 5 . 5 Â   billion . on a gaap basis , the expectation for research and development spending in 2006 is below our previous expectation of approximately $ 5 . 6 Â   billion primarily due to cost savings actions . based on acquisitions completed through july Â   31 , 2006 , we expect amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs to be approximately $ 10 Â   million in the third quarter and approximately $ 45 Â   million for the full year 2006 . we expect the net gains from equity securities and interest and other for the third quarter of 2006 to be approximately $ 220 Â   million . our expectations for gains ( losses ) Â   from equity securities include our expectations for mergers , stock offerings and impairment charges on public and private equity investments , and are based on our experience . it is not possible to know at the present time whether specific investments are likely to be impaired or the extent or timing of individual impairments . in addition , our expectations for gains or losses from equity securities and interest and other could vary depending on equity market levels and volatility , gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities ; impairment charges related to marketable , non-marketable and other investments ; interest rates , cash balances and changes in the fair value of derivative instruments . 43 Â   management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) the tax rate for the third and fourth quarters is currently expected to be approximately 30 . 5 % . the estimated effective tax rate is based on tax law in effect at july Â   1 , 2006 and current expected income , and assumes that we will continue to receive the tax benefit for export sales . see Â “ note 16 : contingencies Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q . the tax rate may also be affected by the closing of acquisitions or divestitures ; the jurisdiction in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed ; changes in estimates of credits , benefits and deductions ; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities ; and the ability to realize deferred tax assets . we believe that we have the product offerings , facilities , personnel , and competitive and financial resources for continued business success , but future revenue , costs , gross margin and profits are all influenced by a number of factors , including those discussed above , all of which are inherently difficult to forecast . status of business outlook and scheduled business updatewe expect that our corporate representatives will , from time to time , meet privately with investors , investment analysts , the media and others , and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the business outlook section and elsewhere in this form 10-q , including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this form 10-q . at the same time , we will keep this form 10-q and our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site ( www . intc . com ) . the public can continue to rely on the business outlook published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered , unless we publish a notice stating otherwise . the statements in the business outlook and other forward-looking statements in this form 10-q are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and sec filings and at other times . from the close of business on september Â   1 , 2006 until our quarterly earnings release is published , presently scheduled for october Â   17 , 2006 , we will observe a Â “ quiet period . Â ” during the quiet period , the business outlook and other forward-looking statements published in our forms 8-k filed on january Â   17 , 2006 , march Â   3 , 2006 , april Â   19 , 2006 and july Â   19 , 2006 , as reiterated or updated as applicable , in our filings with the sec on forms 10-k and 10-q , should be considered historical , speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update . during the quiet period , our representatives will not comment on the business outlook or our financial results or expectations . the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period , and any others that we utilize , from time to time , may vary at our discretion . 44 Â

< date > 2004-06-26 < / date > < price > 27 . 78 < / price > < company > intc < / company > Â   we begin management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( md & a ) with a discussion of intel Â ’ s overall strategy and the strategy for our major business units to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the direction in which our business and products are moving . this strategy discussion is followed by a discussion of the Â “ critical accounting estimates Â ” that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results . we then discuss our Â “ results of operations , Â ” beginning with an overview , followed by an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows in the section entitled Â “ financial condition . Â ” finally , we conclude this md & a with our Â “ business outlook Â ” section , discussing our outlook for 2004 and the third quarter of 2004 . Â   the various sections of this md & a contain a number of forward-looking statements , all of which are based on current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in the Â “ business outlook Â ” section . our actual results may differ materially , and these forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures , mergers , acquisitions or other business combinations that had not been completed as of july 28 , 2004 . Â   strategy Â   our goal is to be the preeminent building block supplier to the worldwide internet economy . our primary focus is on developing advanced integrated silicon technology solutions , which we believe will provide the performance and capabilities necessary to help accelerate the convergence of computing and communications capabilities with digital content . we also provide key components for the networking and communications infrastructure used to connect technology users . we believe that convergence is occurring primarily in three market segments : the digital home , the digital enterprise and mobile internet users . Â   we believe users of computing and communications devices want improved performance , which includes faster processing performance and / or improved capabilities such as multithreaded or multitasking capability , seamless networking connectivity , improved security , reliability , ease of use and interoperability among devices . it is our goal to incorporate features addressing these capabilities in our various products to meet user demands . Â   beginning in 2004 , the company combined its communications-related businesses into a single organization , the intel communications group ( icg ) . previously , these communications businesses were in two separate product line operating segments : the former intel communications group and the wireless communications and computing group ( wccg ) . the company now consists of two reportable product-line operating segments : the intel architecture business and icg . both of our operating segments use their core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits , as well as key silicon and platform capabilities , to provide building blocks for technology solutions . the intel architecture business provides advanced technologies to support the desktop , mobile and enterprise computing platforms . icg focuses on wired and wireless network connectivity products , component-level products and platform solutions for the wireless handheld communications and computing market segments , and key components for networking and communications infrastructure devices . Â   15 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   all of our businesses operate in highly innovative environments characterized by continuing and rapid introduction of new products that offer improved performance at lower prices . as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment , we use our core competencies and financial resources , as well as our global presence and brand recognition . also , under our intel capital program , we make equity investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives . worldwide , our competitors range in size from large established multinational companies with multiple product lines , to smaller companies and new entrants to the marketplace that compete in specialized market segments . with the trend toward convergence in computing and communications products , product offerings will likely cross over multiple categories , offering us new opportunities , but also resulting in more businesses that compete with us . competition tends to increase pricing pressure on our products , which may mean that we must offer our products at lower prices than we had anticipated , resulting in lower profits . in market segments where our competitors have established products and brand recognition , it may be inherently difficult for us to compete against them . when we believe it is appropriate , we will take various steps , including introducing new products and discontinuing older products , reducing prices , and offering rebates and other incentives in order to increase acceptance of our latest products and to be competitive within each relevant market segment . Â   we plan to continue to cultivate new businesses and work with the computing , communications and consumer electronics industries through standards bodies , trade associations , original equipment manufacturers ( oems ) , original design manufacturers ( odms ) , and independent software and operating system vendors , to align the industry to offer products that take advantage of the latest market trends and usage models . these efforts include helping to create the infrastructure for wireless network connectivity . we are also providing development tools and support to help software developers create software applications and operating systems that take advantage of our microprocessors , chipsets and other next-generation semiconductor devices with improved performance , including advanced technology capabilities integrated at the silicon level . Â   intel architecture business Â   the intel architecture business supports the desktop , mobile and enterprise computing platforms . as devices continue to be developed that take advantage of converged computing and communications capabilities and digital content , our goal is to continue to deliver processors with improved performance . hyper-threading technology ( ht technology ) , which can enable an improved multitasking user environment , and intel Â ® Â ™ Â   for the desktop platform , our strategy is to introduce microprocessors and chipsets with improved performance , tailored to the needs of different market segments using a tiered branding approach . in addition , we are working toward introducing components specifically designed for consumer electronics products to be used in the digital home . for the mobile platform , our strategy is to deliver products optimized for some or all of the four mobility vectors : performance , battery life , form factor ( the physical size and shape of a device ) and wireless connectivity . our strategy for the enterprise platform is to provide processors and chipsets with improved performance , which includes advanced technology features , as well as competitive price for performance for entry-level to high-end servers and workstations . Â   16 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   for the desktop performance market segment , we offer the intel Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â   for the mobile market segment , we offer processors optimized for performance mobility and portability users , with form factors from sub-notebook and tablet pcs to thin-and-light as well as full-size notebook pcs . for performance mobility users we offer intel centrino mobile technology , designed and optimized specifically for the four key vectors of mobility . intel centrino mobile technology consists of an intel Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â   the intel architecture business supports the enterprise platform by offering products that address various levels of data processing and compute-intensive applications . our intel Â ® Â ™ Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ™ Â ® Â ® Â ™ Â ® Â ® Â   our microprocessor business generally has followed a seasonal trend ; however , there can be no assurance that this trend will continue . in the past five years , the company Â ’ s sales of microprocessors were higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year . consumer purchases of pcs have been higher in the second half of the year primarily due to back-to-school and holiday demand . in addition , technology purchases from businesses have tended to be higher in the second half of the year . Â   17 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   intel communications group Â   within icg , our strategy is to be the leading supplier of silicon and other component-level communications building blocks for oems and other systems builders . we are focused on developing products that we believe will help to build out the internet as well as developing component-level products for the wireless handheld computing and communications market segments . Â   in support of the build out of the internet , we offer products designed for wired ethernet and wireless connectivity ; for the communications infrastructure , including network and embedded processors ; and for networked storage . our strategy for ethernet connectivity is to expand our product portfolio in the local area network ( lan ) market segment and to address the metropolitan area network ( man ) and networked storage market segments . within the lan and man market segments , we are investing in gigabit ethernet , 10-gigabit ethernet and wireless technologies based on industry standards for wireless 802 . 11 ( wlan , or wifi ) mobile applications and the emerging standard supporting 802 . 16 ( or wimax ) for broadband connectivity . in january 2004 , we introduced the intel Â ® Â   component-level products for the wireless handheld computing and communications market segments include flash memory products , applications processors and cellular baseband chipsets . our strategy for our flash memory products is to offer a broad range of memory densities , leading-edge packaging technology and high-performance functionality . in addition to having offerings that meet the needs of our current cellular customers , we also offer flash memory products for other market segments such as the broad market segment . the broad market segment includes flash memory products found in applications such as set-top boxes , networking products and other devices such as dvd players and dsl cable modems . in our flash memory product portfolio , we currently offer nor flash memory products such as intel strataflash Â ® Â ® Â   critical accounting estimates Â   the methods , estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements , which we discuss under the heading Â “ results of operations Â ” following this section of our md & a . some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments , often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain . our most critical accounting estimates include the assessment of recoverability of goodwill , which impacts goodwill impairments ; valuation of non-marketable equity securities , which impacts net gains ( losses ) on equity securities when we record impairments ; valuation of inventory , which impacts gross margin ; assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets , which primarily impacts gross margin when we impair manufacturing assets or accelerate their depreciation ; and recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities , which impacts our tax provision . below , we discuss these policies further , as well as the estimates and judgments involved . we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies , such as our policies for revenue recognition , including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors ; however , these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates , because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective . Â   18 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   goodwill . Â   non-marketable equity securities Â   we invest in companies that develop software , hardware and other technologies or provide services supporting technologies . our current investment focus areas include : enabling mobile and internet client devices , helping to create the digital home , advancing high-performance communications infrastructure and developing the next generation of silicon production technologies . our focus areas tend to develop and change over time due to rapid advancements in technology . Â   we typically invest in non-marketable equity securities of private companies ; the proceeds from our investments contribute a portion of the funds required for these companies to grow . our investment portfolio ranges from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies whose products or technologies may directly support an intel product or initiative . we invest for strategic reasons , with each investment also evaluated for potential financial returns . the program seeks to invest in companies and businesses that can succeed and have an impact on their market segment . however , these types of investments involve a great deal of risk , and there can be no assurance that any specific company , whether at an early or mature stage , or somewhere in between , will grow or will be successful , and consequently , we could lose all or part of our investment . when the strategic objectives of an investment have been Â   19 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   achieved , or if the investment or business diverges from our strategic objectives , we may decide to dispose of the investment . however , our investments in non-marketable equity securities are not liquid , and there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of these investments on favorable terms or at all . Â   we have an investment in non-voting stock of elpida memory , inc . , a japanese provider of dynamic random access memory ( dram ) , with a carrying amount of $ 124 million at june 26 , 2004 . this investment is intended to provide elpida with an opportunity to align its product roadmap , as appropriate , with our roadmap and is part of our investment strategy to support the development and supply of dram products . no other investment in our non-marketable portfolio was individually significant as of june 26 , 2004 . Â   our ability to recover our strategic investments in non-marketable equity securities and to earn a return on these investments is primarily dependent on how successfully these companies are able to execute to their business plans and how well their products are accepted , as well as their ability to obtain venture capital funding for continued operations , to grow and to take advantage of liquidity events . in the current equity market environment , the companies Â ’ ability to obtain additional funding as well as to take advantage of liquidity events , such as initial public offerings , mergers and private sales , remains constrained . Â   we review all of our investments quarterly for impairment ; however , for non-marketable equity securities , the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment . the indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances include ( a ) the investee Â ’ s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects , ( b ) the technological feasibility of the investee Â ’ s products and technologies , ( c ) the general market conditions in the investee Â ’ s industry , and ( d ) the investee Â ’ s liquidity , debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash . Â   investments identified as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired , in which case we write the investment down to its impaired value . when an investee is not considered viable from a financial or technological point of view , we write down the entire investment since we consider the estimated fair market value to be nominal . if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount or requires a new round of equity funding to stay in operation and the new funding does not appear imminent , we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired , unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise . Â   investments in non-marketable securities are inherently risky and a number of these companies are expected to fail . their success ( or lack thereof ) is dependent upon product development , market acceptance , operational efficiency and other key business success factors . in addition , depending on their future prospects , they may not be able to raise additional financings when needed or they may receive lower valuations , with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings , and the investments would likely become impaired . however , we are not able to determine at the present time which specific investments are likely to be impaired in the future , or the extent or timing of individual impairments . impairments of investments in our portfolio , primarily impairments of non-marketable equity securities , were approximately $ 33 million in the second quarter of 2004 and $ 44 million in the first half of 2004 ( approximately $ 64 million in the second quarter of 2003 and $ 204 million in the first half of 2003 ) . Â   inventory . Â   20 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   long-lived assets . Â   impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows . due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity , we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings . in addition , as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions , we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets , primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements . when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated , and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the assets , we accelerate the rate of depreciation charges in order to fully depreciate the assets over their new shorter useful lives . Â   income taxes . Â   we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets . if recovery is not likely , we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable . as of june 26 , 2004 , we believed that all of the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet would ultimately be recovered . however , should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets , our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable . Â   in addition , the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations . we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the u . s . and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether , and the extent to which , additional taxes will be due . if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary , we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary . we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be . for a discussion of current tax matters , see Â “ note 14 : provision for taxes Â ” and Â “ note 15 : contingencies Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements . Â   21 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   results of operations Â – second quarter of 2004 compared to second quarter of 2003 Â   overview Â   in the second quarter of 2004 , we saw a substantial improvement in our intel architecture business compared to the second quarter of 2003 , and as we look ahead to the rest of 2004 , we are planning for growth in annual revenue made possible by an improved economic climate from 2003 , and further progress in growing overall gross margin dollars . however , as economic recovery proceeds , the year to year growth rates of the last year will inevitably slow . Â   we continue to be largely dependent on the success of our microprocessor business . revenue from sales of microprocessors within our intel architecture business represented approximately 71 % of our consolidated net revenue in the second quarter of 2004 , compared to 74 % in the first quarter of 2004 . this percentage decrease reflects a greater proportion of our second quarter revenue mix being comprised of products such as flash memory , which typically have lower gross margin percentages than microprocessors . we expect this trend to continue in the second half of 2004 and we expect it to negatively impact our overall gross margin percentage for 2004 . our goal remains to grow total revenue and gross margin dollars . growth in sales and profitability depends on our ability to successfully ramp new products , and to obtain continuing benefits from the productive use of our manufacturing assets used for 90-nanometer process technology and 300mm wafers . although we plan to continue ramping our processors built on 90-nanometer process technology , higher yields on this leading-edge process technology have caused increased inventory levels of microprocessors . we plan to lower these inventory levels by slowing the growth rate of wafer starts and this will slow the rate of reduction in microprocessor unit costs . in addition , downward pressure on average selling prices will have an impact on margins in the second half of the year . Â   within icg , our flash memory group successfully reengaged with the broad market segment in the second quarter and we plan on continuing to increase our sales of flash memory products in the second half of the year . although the communications market segment is beginning to experience some signs of growth , icg revenue is largely dependent on our continuing to secure design wins on new and existing products , to supply the products for these design wins and on oems taking the product designs to production . in addition , our flash memory group is largely dependent on customer demand for higher density flash memory and continued end user adoption of new leading-edge cellular handsets . Â   as discussed in our Â “ strategy Â ” section , the results of operations for our operating segments in this md & a are presented under the new organizational structure . all prior period amounts have been restated to conform to the new presentation .

Â   our asia-pacific region Â ’ s revenue comprised the largest portion of our total revenue in q2 2004 and increased 32 % compared to q2 2003 , reflecting both growth in local consumption and movement of more of the production for our customers Â ’ pc supply chain to asia . europe revenue increased 17 % , and japan revenue increased 15 % . our americas region sales were flat . we experienced growth in both mature markets and emerging markets , led by growth in china , in q2 2004 compared to q2 2003 . our business relies on continued sales growth in emerging markets and continued business and consumer investment in technologies that use our products in mature markets . Â   our overall gross margin percentage increased to 59 . 4 % for q2 2004 from 50 . 9 % in q2 2003 . the increase in overall gross margin was due primarily to improved gross margin within the intel architecture business . see Â “ business outlook Â ” for a discussion of gross margin expectations . Â   23 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   intel architecture business Â   the revenue and operating income for the intel architecture operating segment for the second quarter of 2004 and 2003 were as follows : Â   ( in millions ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   q2 Â   2004 Â   Â   q2 Â   2003 microprocessor revenue Â   Â   $ 5 , 751 Â   Â   $ 4 , 844 chipset , motherboard and other revenue Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   1 , 023 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   1 , 006 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   net revenue Â   Â   $ 6 , 774 Â   Â   $ 5 , 850 operating income Â   Â   $ 2 , 788 Â   Â   $ 1 , 829 Â   net revenue for the intel architecture operating segment increased $ 924 million , or 16 % , in q2 2004 compared to q2 2003 . revenue from sales of microprocessors increased 19 % , while revenue from sales of chipsets , motherboards and other was approximately flat . the increase in revenue was primarily due to significantly higher unit sales of microprocessors in q2 2004 , reflecting the overall economic recovery . Â   operating income increased $ 959 million , or 52 % , in q2 2004 compared to q2 2003 . the increase was primarily due to the impact of higher revenue and lower unit costs for microprocessors , and approximately $ 160 million of lower manufacturing startup costs primarily related to the ramp of 90-nanometer technology on 300-millimeter wafer manufacturing . Â   intel communications group Â   the revenue and operating loss for the icg operating segment for the second quarter of 2004 and 2003 were as follows : Â   ( in millions ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   q2 Â   2004 Â   Â   q2 Â   2003 Â   net revenue Â   Â   $ 1 , 271 Â   Â   $ 957 Â   operating loss Â   Â   $ Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( 126 ) Â   $ Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( 255 ) Â   net revenue increased by $ 314 million , or 33 % , in q2 2004 compared to q2 2003 . this increase was primarily due to a significant increase in unit sales of flash memory products with flash memory revenue increasing to $ 587 million in q2 2004 from $ 411 million in q2 2003 . the revenue increase for icg was also due to higher sales of embedded processing components , and to a lesser extent , wireless connectivity products , including the wireless components for our intel centrino mobile technology , as well as communications infrastructure components . Â   the operating loss decreased to $ 126 million in q2 2004 , from a loss of $ 255 million in q2 2003 . higher revenue , as well as the absence of costs incurred in q2 2003 for under-utilized factory capacity for flash memory products , improved the operating results . in addition , due to improved demand , sales of flash memory product inventory that had been previously reserved contributed to the lower operating loss . these improvements were partially offset by higher costs for flash memory products as we sold higher density products , as well as the impact of higher inventory write-offs primarily for certain applications and cellular processors .

Â   for the first half of 2004 , cash provided by operating activities was $ 5 . 8 billion ( $ 4 . 4 billion for the first half of 2003 ) . cash was provided by net income adjusted for non-cash related items . uses of cash for net working capital included increases in accounts receivable and inventories and decreases in accrued compensation and benefits , partially offset by increases in income taxes payable and accounts payable . accounts receivable increased over december 2003 levels , primarily due to a higher proportion of sales occurring toward the end of the current quarter . the days sales outstanding remained the same at 36 days . our three largest customers accounted for approximately 42 % of net revenue for the first half of 2004 , with one of these customers accounting for approximately 19 % of revenue and another customer accounting for approximately 15 % . for the first half of 2003 , our three largest customers accounted for approximately 40 % of net revenue . additionally , those three largest customers accounted for approximately 48 % of net accounts receivable at june 26 , 2004 ( 43 % at december 27 , 2003 ) . our inventory levels were higher by 28 % at the end of the second quarter of 2004 compared to december 2003 as yields improved and we continued to ramp new products for sale in the remainder of 2004 . approximately half of the increase was for microprocessors and the other half was split between flash memory and chipsets . during the second half of the year , we expect to lower the inventory levels of microprocessors by slowing the planned growth rate of wafer starts for these products . accrued compensation and benefits decreased during the first half of 2004 as we paid year-end bonuses and made the annual cash contribution to our profit sharing plan . the increase in the accrual for income taxes payable is due to the timing of payments and refunds . accounts payable increased at the end of the second quarter of 2004 compared to december 2003 primarily due to the timing of capital expenditures . Â   we used $ 3 . 7 billion in net cash for investing activities during the first half of 2004 , compared to $ 1 . 3 billion during the first half of 2003 . improved corporate credit profiles facilitated a slight shift in our portfolio of investments in debt securities to longer term maturities . capital expenditures decreased to $ 1 . 7 billion in the first half of 2004 from $ 1 . 9 billion in the first half of 2003 . we continued to invest in capital equipment and construction , primarily for additional microprocessor manufacturing capacity , but at a lower rate than in the same period for the prior year . Â   we used $ 3 . 0 billion in net cash for financing activities in the first half of 2004 , compared to $ 2 . 1 billion in the first half of 2003 . the major financing use of cash was for the repurchase of shares as we repurchased 105 . 2 million shares of common stock for $ 3 . 0 billion compared to 114 . 4 million shares for $ 2 . 0 billion in the same period in 2003 . as of june 26 , 2004 , approximately 309 million shares remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization . Â   additional financing uses of cash in the first half of 2004 included payments of dividends . in january 2004 , our board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $ 0 . 02 per share to $ 0 . 04 per share , effective for the first-quarter 2004 dividend . therefore , our dividend payments were $ 517 million in the first half of 2004 , higher than the $ 262 million paid in the same period of the prior year . financing sources of cash during the first half of 2004 were primarily $ 552 million in proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee stock plans ( $ 353 million during the first half of 2003 ) . Â   another potential source of liquidity is authorized borrowings , including commercial paper , of $ 3 . 0 billion . there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program during the first half of 2004 . we also maintain the ability to offer an aggregate of approximately $ 1 . 4 billion in debt , equity and other securities under u . s . securities and exchange commission ( sec ) shelf registration statements . Â   we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet our business requirements for the next twelve months , including capital expenditures for the expansion or upgrading of worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test capacity , working capital requirements , the dividend program , potential stock repurchases and potential future acquisitions or strategic investments . Â   29 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   employee equity incentive plans Â   our equity incentive program is a broad-based , long-term retention program that is intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests . substantially all of our employees participate in our equity incentive program . in may 2004 , stockholder approval was obtained for the 2004 equity incentive plan ( the 2004 plan ) . under the 2004 plan , 240 million shares of common stock were made available for issuance during the two year period ending june 30 , 2006 . under the 2004 plan , options to purchase shares may be granted to all employees and non-employee directors . in addition to stock options , other equity incentive award types , such as restricted stock , stock units and stock appreciation rights , may also be used . the 2004 plan also allows for performance-based vesting for equity incentive awards . the intel corporation 1984 stock option plan expired in may 2004 , and the intel corporation 1997 stock option plan was terminated upon stockholder approval of the 2004 plan . shares previously authorized for issuance under these plans are no longer available for future grants . Â   options granted by the company under the 2004 plan will generally expire seven years from the grant date . options granted under our previous stock option plans generally expired ten years from the grant date . options granted to existing and newly hired employees generally vest over a four year period from the date of grant . certain grants to key employees expire ten years from the date of grant and have delayed vesting generally beginning six years from the date of grant . Â   we have a goal to keep the potential incremental dilution related to our option program to a long-term average of less than 2 % annually . the dilution percentage is calculated using the new option grants for the year , net of options forfeited by employees leaving the company and options expired , divided by the total outstanding shares at the beginning of the year . Â   options granted to employees , including officers , and non-employee directors from 2000 through the first half of 2004 are summarized as follows : Â   ( shares in millions ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ytd Â   Â   2003 Â   Â   2002 Â   Â   2001 Â   Â   2000 Â   total options granted1 Â   Â   95 Â   Â   110 Â   Â   174 Â   Â   238 Â   Â   163 Â   less options forfeited1 Â   Â   ( 15 ) Â   ( 40 ) Â   ( 44 ) Â   ( 47 ) Â   ( 31 ) net options granted Â   Â   80 Â   Â   70 Â   Â   130 Â   Â   191 Â   Â   132 Â   net grants as % of outstanding shares2 Â   Â   1 . 2 % Â   1 . 1 % Â   1 . 9 % Â   2 . 8 % Â   2 . 0 % grants to listed officers3 as % of total options granted Â   Â   1 . 1 % Â   2 . 4 % Â   1 . 7 % Â   0 . 8 % Â   0 . 4 % grants to listed officers as % of outstanding shares Â   Â   < 0 . 1 % Â   < 0 . 1 % Â   < 0 . 1 % Â   < 0 . 1 % Â   < 0 . 1 % cumulative options held by listed officers as % of total options outstanding Â   Â   2 . 1 % Â   2 . 1 % Â   2 . 1 % Â   2 . 0 % Â   2 . 4 % 1excluding options assumed in connection with acquisitions . 2outstanding shares as of the beginning of each period . 3 Â “ listed officers Â ” for 2004 are those listed in our proxy statement dated march 31 , 2004 , defined as our chief executive officer and each of the four other most highly compensated executive officers . Â   Â   in accordance with a policy established by the compensation committee of the board of directors , total options granted to the listed officers may not exceed 5 % of total options granted in any year . for the first six months of 2004 , options granted to listed officers amounted to 1 . 1 % of the grants made to all employees . all stock option grants are made after a review by , and with the approval of , the compensation committee . all members of the compensation committee are independent directors , as defined in the applicable rules for issuers traded on the nasdaq stock market * .

Â   31 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   information as of june 26 , 2004 regarding equity compensation plans approved and not approved by stockholders is summarized in the following table ( shares in millions ) : Â   plan category Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( a ) number Â   of Â   shares Â   to Â   be Â   ( b ) Â   ( c ) number Â   of Â   shares Â   remaining equity compensation plans approved Â   by Â   stockholders Â   146 . 3 Â   Â   Â   $ 17 . 84 Â   316 . 31 equity compensation plans not Â   approved Â   by Â   stockholders Â   742 . 3 Â   Â   Â   $ 27 . 95 Â   Â — Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   total Â   888 . 62 Â   $ 26 . 28 Â   316 . 3 Â   Â   1 includes 76 . 4 million shares available under our 1976 employee stock participation plan . 2 total excludes 7 . 6 million shares issuable under outstanding options , with a weighted average exercise price of $ 16 . 73 , originally granted under plans we assumed in connection with acquisitions . we do not intend to grant any further options under these plans . Â   32 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   business outlook Â   as we look ahead to the rest of 2004 , we are planning for growth in annual revenue made possible by an improved economic climate , and further progress in growing overall gross margin dollars . for the third quarter of 2004 , we expect revenue to be between $ 8 . 6 billion and $ 9 . 2 billion , compared to second quarter revenue of $ 8 . 05 billion . the midpoint of this range would be a sequential increase of more than 10 % , which is higher than our average seasonal increase . this revenue expectation assumes slightly above normal seasonality for intel architecture products along with good growth in flash and other icg products in the third quarter of 2004 . although the communications market segment is beginning to experience some signs of growth , icg revenue is largely dependent on our continuing to secure design wins on new and existing products , to supply the products for these design wins and on oems taking the product designs to production . demand for our flash memory products is uncertain in the highly competitive cellular handset market segment . revenue growth for our flash memory products is largely dependent on customer demand for higher density flash memory and continued end user adoption of new leading-edge cellular handsets . Â   our financial results are substantially dependent on sales of microprocessors and related components by the intel architecture operating segment . revenue is partly a function of the mix of microprocessor types and speeds sold as well as the mix of related chipsets and motherboards , all of which are difficult to forecast . because of the wide price differences among desktop , mobile and server microprocessors , the mix of types and speeds of microprocessors sold affects the average selling price that we will realize and has a large impact on our revenue and gross margin . microprocessor revenue is also dependent on the availability of other parts of the system platform , including chipsets , motherboards , operating system software and application software . revenue is also affected by our sales of other semiconductor and non-semiconductor products and is subject to the impact of economic conditions in various geographic regions . Â   we expect the gross margin percentage in the third quarter of 2004 to be approximately 60 % , plus or minus a couple of points , approximately flat compared to 59 . 4 % in the second quarter . for the full year of 2004 , our gross margin is expected to be 60 % , plus or minus a couple of points . this expectation is lower than our previous expectation of 62 % , plus or minus a few points . our expectation incorporates the effect of higher revenues , offset by two other factors . first , we anticipate increased revenues from flash , chipsets , and motherboards , and as these products grow at a faster rate than microprocessors , our overall revenue mix will have a greater proportion of lower margin products . second , higher yields on our 90-nanometer , 300mm microprocessors have caused increased inventory levels ; however , we plan to lower the inventory levels of microprocessors by slowing the growth rate of wafer starts and this will slow the rate of reduction in microprocessor unit costs . in addition , downward pressure on average selling prices will have an impact on margins in the second half of the year . our gross margin varies primarily with revenue levels , which are dependent on unit volumes and prices , as well as the mix of types and speeds of processors sold , and the mix of microprocessors , related chipsets and motherboards , and other semiconductor and non-semiconductor products . our gross margin should benefit in the future from the productive use of 90-nanometer technology and 300mm wafers , as we build more of our mainstream products with these technologies . variability of other factors will also continue to affect cost of sales and the gross margin percentage , including unit costs and yield issues associated with production at our factories , timing and execution of the manufacturing ramp including the continuing ramp of the 90-nanometer process technology , excess of manufacturing capacity , the reusability of factory equipment , impairment of manufacturing or assembly and test assets , excess inventory , inventory obsolescence and variations in inventory valuation . Â   we have significantly expanded our semiconductor manufacturing and assembly and test capacity over the last few years , and we continue to plan capacity based on the assumed continued success of our overall strategy and the acceptance of our products in specific market segments . we currently expect that capital spending will be between $ 3 . 6 billion and $ 4 . 0 billion in 2004 , compared to $ 3 . 7 billion in 2003 . the midpoint of this range , $ 3 . 8 billion , is only slightly higher than 2003 . this capital-spending plan is dependent on expectations regarding production efficiencies and delivery times of various machinery and equipment , and construction schedules for new facilities . if the demand for our products does not grow and continue to move toward higher performance products in the various market segments , revenue and gross margin would be adversely affected and manufacturing and / or assembly and test capacity would be under-utilized , and the rate of capital spending could be reduced . we could be required to record an impairment of our manufacturing or assembly and test equipment and / or facilities , or factory planning decisions may cause us to record accelerated depreciation . however , in the long term , revenue and gross margin may also be affected if we do not add capacity fast enough to meet market demand . Â   33 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   we expect depreciation expense to be between $ 1 . 1 billion and $ 1 . 2 billion for the third quarter of 2004 and $ 4 . 6 billion for the full year 2004 . Â   spending on research and development , plus marketing , general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2004 is expected to be approximately $ 2 . 5 billion , slightly higher than the second quarter . expenses , particularly certain marketing and compensation-related expenses , may vary from this expectation , depending in part on the level of revenue and profits . Â   research and development spending is expected to be approximately $ 4 . 8 billion in 2004 . Â   based on acquisitions completed through july 28 , 2004 , we expect amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs to be approximately $ 40 million in the third quarter and $ 175 million for the full year 2004 . Â   we expect the net gains from equity securities and interest and other for the third quarter of 2004 to be approximately $ 50 million . our expectations for gains ( losses ) from equity securities include impairment charges on private equity investments and are based on our experience . it is not possible to know at the present time whether specific investments are likely to be impaired or the extent or timing of individual impairments . in addition , our expectations for gains or losses from equity securities and interest and other assume no unanticipated events and vary depending on equity market levels and volatility , gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities , interest rates , cash balances , and changes in the fair value of derivative instruments . Â   at june 26 , 2004 , we held non-marketable equity securities with a carrying value of $ 627 million . a number of these companies are expected to fail . their success ( or lack thereof ) is dependent upon product development , market acceptance , operational efficiency and other key business success factors . in addition , depending on their future prospects , they may not be able to raise additional financings when needed or they may receive lower valuations , with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings , and the investments would likely become impaired . however , we are not able determine at the present time which specific investments are likely to be impaired in the future , or the extent or timing of individual impairments . Â   we currently expect our effective tax rate for the third and fourth quarters of 2004 to be approximately 31 % , as compared to the previous expectation of approximately 32 % , primarily due to an increase in estimated tax benefit for export sales . the estimated effective tax rate is based on current expected income , and assumes the company continues to receive the tax benefit for export sales ( see Â “ note 14 : provision for taxes Â ” and Â “ note 15 : contingencies Â ” in notes to consolidated condensed financial statements ) . the tax rate may be affected by changes in tax law , the closing of acquisitions or divestitures , the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed , the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities and the ability to realize deferred tax assets . Â   as of june 26 , 2004 , we have approximately $ 3 . 7 billion of goodwill remaining on our balance sheet , of which $ 3 . 2 billion is related to the icg operating segment and $ 533 million is related to the intel architecture operating segment . particularly for icg , we may incur charges for the impairment of goodwill in the future if the communications and mobile handheld computing sectors do not grow as we expect , if icg fails to deliver new products , if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance , if we fail to achieve our assumed revenue growth rates or assumed gross margin , or if interest rates increase significantly . Â   we are currently a party to various legal proceedings and claims , including legal proceedings and claims related to taxes and to allegations of patent infringement . management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations . however , litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur . an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages , invalidation of a patent or group of patents , additional taxes owed or , in cases Â   34 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   where injunctive relief is sought , an injunction prohibiting intel from selling one or more products . if an unfavorable ruling were to occur in any specific period , there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations of that period or future periods . management believes that , given our current liquidity and cash and investment balances , even an adverse judgment would not have a material impact on cash and investments or liquidity . Â   we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the u . s . and abroad , and if we determine that it is necessary or desirable , we may seek licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights from others . while our patents and the intellectual property licenses we obtain are an important element of our success , our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any one patent . however , an injunction preventing us from selling products based on one or more patents could have a material adverse effect upon our business . there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products . we can also give no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses from any intellectual property owner where needed , or that we can accept the terms of any offered licenses . further , we are not typically able to resolve every dispute without litigation , which is generally time-consuming and expensive . if we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation , we may not be able to sell a particular product or family of products due to an injunction , or we may have to pay material amounts of damages . Â   our sales agreements often contain intellectual property indemnities , such as patent and copyright indemnities , and our customers may assert claims against us for indemnity when they receive claims from other intellectual property owners alleging that our customers Â ’ products infringe such others Â ’ intellectual property rights . when we receive such claims , we refer them to our counsel . current claims are in various stages of evaluation , negotiation and litigation . such claims may result in our participation in or defense against the claims asserted against our customers by such other intellectual property owners , including participation in and defense of litigation against our customers . Â   we operate globally , with sales offices and research and development as well as manufacturing and assembly and test facilities in many countries , and , as a result , we are subject to risks and factors associated with doing business outside the u . s . global operations involve inherent risks that include currency controls and fluctuations , tariff and import regulations , and regulatory requirements that may limit our or our customers Â ’ ability to manufacture , assemble and test , design , develop or sell products in particular countries . if terrorist activity , armed conflict , civil or military unrest , or political instability occurs in the u . s . , israel or other locations , such events may disrupt manufacturing , assembly and test , logistics , security and communications , and could also result in reduced demand for intel Â ’ s products . the impacts of major health concerns , or of large-scale outages or interruptions of service from utility or other infrastructure providers , on intel , its suppliers , customers or other third parties could also adversely affect our business and impact customer order patterns . we could also be affected if labor issues disrupt our transportation arrangements or those of our customers or suppliers . on a worldwide basis , we regularly review our key infrastructure , systems , services and suppliers , both internally and externally , to seek to identify significant vulnerabilities as well as areas of potential business impact if a disruptive event were to occur . once identified , we assess the risks , and as we consider it to be appropriate , we initiate actions intended to reduce the risks and their potential impact . however , there can be no assurance that we have identified all significant risks or that we can mitigate all identified risks with reasonable effort . Â   our future results of operations and the other forward-looking statements contained in this filing , including this md & a , involve a number of risks and uncertainties Â — in particular , the statements regarding our goals and strategies , new product introductions , plans to cultivate new businesses , market segment share and growth rate assumptions , future economic conditions and recovery in the communications businesses , revenue , pricing , gross margin and costs , capital spending , depreciation and amortization , research and development expenses , potential impairment of investments , the tax rate and pending tax and legal proceedings . in addition to various factors that we have discussed above , a number of other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations . demand for our products , which impacts our revenue and gross margin percentage , is affected by business and economic conditions , as well as computing and communications industry trends and the development and timing of introduction of compelling software applications and operating systems that take advantage of the features of our products . demand for our products is also affected by changes in customer order patterns , such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by our customers and the timing of customer purchases . revenue and gross margin could also be affected by competitive factors , such as competing chip architectures and manufacturing technologies , competing software-compatible microprocessors , pricing pressures and other Â   35 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   competitive factors , as well as market acceptance of our new products in specific market segments , the availability of sufficient inventory to meet demand and the availability of externally purchased components or materials . our future revenue is also dependent on continuing technological advancement , including developing and implementing new processes and strategic products , as well as the timing of new product introductions , sustaining and growing new businesses , and integrating and operating any acquired businesses . our results could also be affected by adverse effects associated with product defects and errata ( deviations from published specifications ) and by litigation or regulatory matters involving intellectual property , stockholder , consumer , antitrust and other issues . Â   we believe that we have the product offerings , facilities , personnel , and competitive and financial resources for continued business success , but future revenue , costs , margins and profits are all influenced by a number of factors , including those discussed above , all of which are inherently difficult to forecast . Â   36 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   status of business outlook and scheduled business update Â   we expect that our corporate representatives will from time to time meet privately with investors , investment analysts , the media and others , and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the Â “ business outlook Â ” section and elsewhere in this form 10-q , including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this form 10-q . at the same time , we will keep this form 10-q and our then current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site ( www . intc . com Â   we intend to publish a mid-quarter business update on september 2 , 2004 . from the close of business on august 27 , 2004 until publication of the update , we will observe a Â “ quiet period Â ” during which the business outlook and other forward-looking statements published in our earnings press releases on january 14 , 2004 , april 13 , 2004 and july 13 , 2004 , as reiterated or updated , as applicable , in our filings with the sec on forms 10-k and 10-q , should be considered historical , speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update . during the quiet period , our representatives will not comment on the business outlook or our financial results or expectations . Â   a quiet period operating in similar fashion with regard to the business outlook and our sec filings will begin at the close of business on september 10 , 2004 and will extend until the day when our next quarterly earnings release is published , presently scheduled for october 12 , 2004 .

< date > 2004-03-27 < / date > < price > 27 . 38 < / price > < company > intc < / company > Â   we begin management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( md & a ) with a discussion of intel Â ’ s overall strategy and the strategy for our major business units to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the direction in which our business and products are moving . this strategy discussion is followed by a discussion of the Â “ critical accounting estimates Â ” that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results . we then discuss our Â “ results of operations , Â ” beginning with an overview , followed by an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows in the section entitled Â “ financial condition . Â ” finally , we conclude this md & a with our Â “ business outlook Â ” section , discussing our outlook for 2004 and the second quarter of 2004 . Â   the various sections of this md & a contain a number of forward-looking statements , all of which are based on current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in the Â “ business outlook Â ” section . our actual results may differ materially , and these forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures , mergers , acquisitions or other business combinations that had not been completed as of april 28 , 2004 . Â   strategy Â   our goal is to be the preeminent building block supplier to the worldwide internet economy . our primary focus is on developing advanced integrated silicon technology solutions , which we believe will provide the performance and technology features necessary to help accelerate the convergence of computing and communications capabilities . convergence refers to having computing and communications capabilities in an integrated product solution . we also provide key components for networking and communications infrastructures used to connect technology users . we believe users of computing and communications devices want not only higher performance but also other capabilities such as multithreaded or multitasking capability , seamless networking connectivity , improved security , reliability , ease of use and interoperability among devices . it is our goal to incorporate features addressing these capabilities in our various products to meet user demands . Â   effective for the first quarter of 2004 , we consolidated our communications-related businesses into a single organization , the intel communications group ( icg ) . we believe that as computing and communications converge , the consolidation of our previous intel communications group and wireless communications and computing group ( wccg ) will give us the opportunity to better coordinate product planning and our customer focus between our communications infrastructure and wireless client efforts going forward . prior to the combination of these communications-related businesses , our consumer electronics business , which was previously part of our former icg operating segment , was moved into our intel architecture business . the discussion below and the results of operations for our operating segments in this md & a are presented under the new organizational structure , and all prior period amounts have been restated to conform to the new presentation . Â   both of our operating segments use their core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits , as well as key silicon and platform capabilities , to provide building blocks for technology solutions . the intel architecture business provides advanced technologies to support the desktop , mobile and enterprise computing platforms . icg focuses on wired and wireless network connectivity products , component-level products and platform solutions for the wireless handheld communications and computing market segments , and key components for networking and communications infrastructure devices . Â   15 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   all of our businesses operate in highly innovative environments characterized by continuing and rapid introduction of new products offering improved performance at lower prices . as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment , we use our core competencies and financial resources , as well as our global presence and brand recognition . also , under our intel capital program , we make equity investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives . worldwide , our competitors range in size from large established multinational companies with multiple product lines to smaller companies and new entrants to the marketplace that compete in specialized market segments . with the trend toward convergence in computing and communications products , product offerings will likely cross over multiple categories , offering us new opportunities , but also resulting in more businesses that compete with us . competition tends to increase pricing pressure on our products , which may mean that we must offer our products at lower prices than we had anticipated , resulting in lower profits . in markets where our competitors have established products and brand recognition , it may be inherently difficult for us to compete against them . when we believe it is appropriate , we will take various steps , including introducing new products and discontinuing older products , reducing prices , and offering rebates and other incentives in order to increase acceptance of our latest products and to be competitive within each relevant market segment . Â   we plan to continue to cultivate new businesses and work with the computing , communications and consumer electronics industries through standards bodies , trade associations , original equipment manufacturers ( oems ) , original design manufacturers ( odms ) , and independent software and operating system vendors , to align the industry to offer products that take advantage of the latest market trends and usage models . these efforts include helping to create the infrastructure for wireless network connectivity . we are also working with the industry to develop software applications and operating systems that take advantage of our microprocessors , chipsets and other next-generation semiconductor devices with higher performance or advanced features , including advanced technology capabilities integrated at the silicon level . Â   intel architecture business Â   the intel architecture business supports the desktop , mobile and enterprise computing platforms . as devices take advantage of converged computing and communications capabilities , our goal is to continue to deliver processors with higher performance and / or advanced technology features such as hyper-threading technology ( ht technology ) , which can enable multithreading and multitasking , and the features offered with our intel Â ® Â ™ Â   for the desktop platform , our strategy is to introduce microprocessors and chipsets with higher performance and / or advanced technology features tailored to the needs of different market segments using a tiered branding approach . in addition , we are working toward introducing components specifically designed for consumer electronics products to be used in the digital home . for the mobile platform , our strategy is to deliver products optimized for some or all of the four mobility vectors : performance , battery life , form factor ( the physical size and shape of a device ) and wireless connectivity . our strategy for the enterprise platform is to provide processors and chipsets with high performance and / or advanced technology features , as well as competitive price for performance for entry-level to high-end servers and workstations . Â   for the desktop performance market segment , we offer the intel Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â   16 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   for the mobile market segment , we offer processors optimized for performance mobility and portability users , with form factors from sub-notebook and tablet pcs to thin-and-light as well as full-size notebook pcs . for performance mobility users we offer intel centrino mobile technology , designed and optimized specifically for the four key vectors of mobility . intel centrino mobile technology consists of an intel Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â   the intel architecture business supports the enterprise platform by offering products that address various levels of data processing and compute-intensive applications . our intel Â ® Â ™ Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ™ Â ® Â ™ Â ® Â ® Â ® Â   our microprocessor business generally has followed a seasonal trend ; however , there can be no assurance that this trend will continue . in the past five years , the company Â ’ s sales of microprocessors were higher in the second half of the year . Â   intel communications group Â   within icg , our strategy is to be the leading supplier of silicon and other component-level communications building blocks for oems and other systems builders . we are focused on developing products that we believe will help to build out the internet as well as developing component-level products for the wireless handheld computing and communications market segments . Â   in support of the build out of the internet , we offer products designed for wired ethernet and wireless connectivity ; for the communications infrastructure , including network and embedded processors ; and for networked storage . our strategy for ethernet connectivity is to expand our product portfolio in the local area network ( lan ) market segment and to address the metropolitan area network ( man ) and networked storage market segments . within the lan and man market segments , we are investing in gigabit ethernet , 10-gigabit ethernet and wireless technologies based on industry standards for wireless 802 . 11 ( wlan , or wifi ) mobile applications and the emerging standard supporting 802 . 16 ( or wimax ) for broadband connectivity . in january 2004 , we introduced the intel Â ® pro / wireless 2200bg network connection , featuring both 802 . 11b and 802 . 11g wireless functionality for notebook pcs based on intel centrino mobile technology . in network processing , we deliver products that are basic building blocks for modular communications platforms . these products include advanced , programmable processors used to manage and direct data moving across the internet and corporate networks . we also offer embedded processors that can be used for modular communications platform applications as well as for industrial equipment and point-of-sale systems . in the networked storage market segment , we are developing products that allow storage resources to be added at any location on either of the two most prevalent types of storage networks : ethernet or fibre channel . Â   17 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   component-level products for the wireless handheld computing and communications market segments include flash memory products , applications processors and cellular baseband chipsets . our strategy for our flash memory products is to offer a broad range of memory densities , leading-edge packaging technology and high-performance functionality . in addition to having offerings that meet the needs of our current cellular customers , we plan to further expand our customer base beyond the core cellular market segment to other market segments such as the broad market segment . the broad market segment includes flash memory products found in applications such as set-top boxes , networking products and other devices such as dvd players and dsl cable modems . in our flash memory product portfolio , we currently offer nor flash memory products such as intel strataflash Â ® wireless memory , which uses two-bit-per-cell technology to provide a single-chip solution for fast code execution with higher storage densities and 1 . 8-volt operation optimized for advanced mobile phone designs . in application processing , intel xscale Â ® technology provides the processing capability in data-enabled mobile phones and pdas . addressing the trend toward convergence in computing and communications , we offer stacked packaging solutions ( stacking an applications processor on top of memory ) as well as packaging that stacks several memory chips together . Â   critical accounting estimates Â   the methods , estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements , which we discuss under the heading Â “ results of operations Â ” following this section of our md & a . some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments , often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain . our most critical accounting estimates include the assessment of recoverability of goodwill , which impacts goodwill impairments ; valuation of non-marketable equity securities , which impacts net gains ( losses ) on equity securities when we record impairments ; valuation of inventory , which impacts gross margin ; assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets , which primarily impacts gross margin when we impair manufacturing assets or accelerate their depreciation ; and recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities , which impacts our tax provision . below , we discuss these policies further , as well as the estimates and judgments involved . we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies , such as our policies for revenue recognition , including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors ; however , these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates , because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective . Â   goodwill . Â   18 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   expect , if we fail to deliver new products for icg , if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance , if we fail to achieve our assumed revenue growth rates or assumed gross margin , or if interest rates increase significantly . prior to the combination of our communications-related businesses , our consumer electronics business , which was previously part of our former icg operating segment , was moved to our intel architecture business . based on the estimated relative fair value of the consumer electronics business to the icg reporting unit , goodwill of $ 466 million was transferred to our intel architecture business . Â   non-marketable equity securities . Â   we invest in companies that develop software , hardware and other technologies or provide services supporting technologies . our current investment focus areas include : enabling mobile and internet client devices , helping to create the digital home , advancing high-performance communications infrastructure and developing the next generation of silicon production technologies . our focus areas tend to develop and change over time due to rapid advancements in technology . Â   we typically invest in non-marketable equity securities of private companies ; the proceeds from our investments contribute a portion of the funds required for these companies to grow . our investment portfolio ranges from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies whose products or technologies may directly support an intel product or initiative . we invest for strategic reasons , with each investment also evaluated for potential financial returns . the program seeks to invest in companies and businesses that can succeed and have an impact on their market segment . however , these types of investments involve a great deal of risk , and there can be no assurance that any specific company , whether at an early or mature stage , or somewhere in between , will grow or will become successful , and consequently , we could lose all or part of our investment . when the strategic objectives of an investment have been achieved , or if the investment or business diverges from our strategic objectives , we may decide to dispose of the investment . however , our investments in non-marketable equity securities are not liquid , and there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of these investments on favorable terms or at all . Â   we have an investment in non-voting stock of elpida memory , inc . , a japanese provider of dynamic random access memory ( dram ) , with a carrying amount of $ 124 million at march 27 , 2004 . this investment is intended to help align elpida Â ’ s product roadmap , as appropriate , with our roadmap and is part of our investment strategy to support the development and supply of dram products . no other investment in our non-marketable portfolio was individually significant as of march 27 , 2004 . Â   our ability to recover our strategic investments in non-marketable equity securities and to earn a return on these investments is primarily dependent on how successfully these companies are able to execute to their business plans and how well their products are accepted , as well as their ability to obtain venture capital funding for continued operations , to grow and to take advantage of liquidity events . in the current equity market environment , their ability to obtain additional funding as well as to take advantage of liquidity events , such as initial public offerings ( ipos ) , mergers and private sales , remains constrained . Â   we review all of our investments quarterly for impairment ; however , for non-marketable equity securities , the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment . the indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances include ( a ) the investee Â ’ s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects , ( b ) the technological feasibility of the investee Â ’ s products and technologies , ( c ) the general market conditions in the investee Â ’ s industry , and ( d ) the investee Â ’ s liquidity , debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash . Â   19 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   investments identified as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired , in which case we write the investment down to its impaired value . when an investee is not considered viable from a financial or technological point of view , we write down the entire investment since we consider the estimated fair market value to be nominal . if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount or requires a new round of equity funding to stay in operation and the new funding does not appear imminent , we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired , unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise . Â   we have experienced substantial impairments in our portfolio of non-marketable equity securities as equity markets declined significantly over the past few years . if the level of ipo market activity does not increase and the availability of venture capital funding for technology investments does not improve , our non-marketable investments may be adversely affected . as companies within our portfolio attempt to raise additional funds , the funds may not be available to them or they may receive lower valuations , with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings , and the investments would likely become impaired . however , we are not able to determine at the present time which specific investments are likely to be impaired in the future , or the extent or timing of individual impairments . impairments of investments in our portfolio , primarily impairments of non-marketable equity securities , were approximately $ 11 million in the first quarter of 2004 ( approximately $ 140 million in the first quarter of 2003 ) . Â   inventory . Â   long-lived assets . Â   impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows . due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity , we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings . in addition , as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions , we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets , primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements . when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated , and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the assets , we accelerate the rate of depreciation charges in order to fully depreciate the assets over their new shorter useful lives . Â   20 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   income taxes . Â   we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets . if recovery is not likely , we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable . as of march 27 , 2004 , we believed that all of the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet would ultimately be recovered . however , should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets , our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable . Â   in addition , the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations . we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the u . s . and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether , and the extent to which , additional taxes will be due . if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary , we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary . we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be . for a discussion of current tax matters , see Â “ note 13 : contingencies Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements . Â   21 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   results of operations Â – first quarter of 2004 compared to first quarter of 2003 Â   overview Â   in the first quarter of 2004 , we saw a substantial improvement in our intel architecture business compared to the first quarter of 2003 , and as we look ahead to the rest of 2004 , we are planning for growth in annual revenue made possible by an improved economic climate , and further progress in overall gross margin . we continue to be largely dependent on the success of our microprocessor business . revenue from sales of microprocessors within our intel architecture business represented approximately 74 % of our consolidated net revenue in the first quarter of 2004 . growth in sales and profitability depends on our ability to successfully ramp new products , and to obtain continuing benefits from the productive use of our manufacturing assets used for 90-nanometer process technology and 300mm wafers . during 2004 , we plan to continue ramping our 90-nanometer desktop processor , code-named Â “ prescott , Â ” and 90-nanometer mobile processor , code named Â “ dothan . Â ” in icg , our goal is to continue to streamline operations , and work towards profitability . within icg , our flash memory group benefited in the first quarter from our return to the broad market segment through our distribution channel . growth within icg is largely dependent on our securing design wins for new products and oems taking these product designs to production . in addition , our flash memory group is largely dependent on customer demand for higher density flash memory and continued end user adoption of new leading-edge cellular handsets . our business relies on continued sales growth in emerging markets and continued business and consumer investment in technologies that use our products in mature markets . Â   as discussed in our Â “ strategy Â ” section , the results of operations for our operating segments in this md & a are presented under the new organizational structure . all prior period amounts have been restated to conform to the new presentation .

Â   22 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   all of our geographic regions experienced increased revenue in q1 2004 compared to q1 2003 . our asia-pacific region Â ’ s revenue comprised the largest portion of our total revenue and increased 24 % , reflecting growth in local consumption and asia Â ’ s continued growth as a global manufacturing and design center . japan experienced substantial growth with an increase of 32 % , europe increased 17 % , and the americas region increased 12 % . we experienced solid growth in both emerging and mature markets in q1 2004 compared to q1 2003 . Â   our overall gross margin percentage increased to 60 . 2 % for q1 2004 from 52 . 0 % in q1 2003 . total gross margin benefited from improved gross margin within the intel architecture business as well as a slight shift in the total company revenue mix to the higher-margin intel architecture business . these improvements were partially offset by lower gross margin in icg . see Â “ business outlook Â ” for a discussion of gross margin expectations . Â   intel architecture business Â   the revenue and operating income for the intel architecture operating segment for the first quarter of 2004 and 2003 were as follows : Â   ( in millions ) Â   Â   q1 Â   2004 Â   Â   q1 Â   2003 microprocessor revenue Â   Â   $ Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   5 , 980 Â   Â   $ Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   4 , 860 chipset , motherboard and other revenue Â   Â   Â   1 , 045 Â   Â   Â   912 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   total revenue Â   Â   $ 7 , 025 Â   Â   $ 5 , 772 operating income Â   Â   $ 3 , 015 Â   Â   $ 1 , 908 Â   net revenue for the intel architecture operating segment increased $ 1 . 3 billion , or 22 % , in q1 2004 compared to q1 2003 . revenue from sales of microprocessors increased 23 % while revenue from sales of chipsets , motherboards and other increased 15 % . the increase in revenue was primarily due to significantly higher unit sales of microprocessors in q1 2004 , and to a lesser extent , higher average selling prices of microprocessors . Â   operating income increased $ 1 . 1 billion , or 58 % , in q1 2004 compared to q1 2003 . the increase was primarily due to the impact of higher revenue and lower unit costs for microprocessors . these increases were partially offset by a $ 162 million charge in q1 2004 relating to a settlement agreement with intergraph corporation . in addition , q1 2003 benefited from the unusually high level of sales of microprocessor and chipset inventory that had been previously reserved . Â   intel communications group Â   the revenue and operating loss for the icg operating segment for the first quarter of 2004 and 2003 were as follows : Â   ( in millions ) Â   Â   q1 Â   2004 Â   Â   q1 Â   2003 Â   revenue Â   Â   $ Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   1 , 065 Â   Â   $ 963 Â   operating loss Â   Â   $ ( 219 ) Â   $ Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( 218 ) Â   net revenue increased by $ 102 million , or 11 % , in q1 2004 compared to q1 2003 primarily due to higher revenue from sales of embedded processing components and wireless connectivity products , including the wireless components for our intel centrino mobile technology . these increases in revenue were partially offset by lower revenue from sales of cellular baseband chipsets . in addition , in q1 2004 , revenue for flash memory products increased to $ 417 million from $ 409 million in q1 2003 . Â   the operating loss remained relatively flat at $ 219 million in q1 2004 , compared to $ 218 million in q1 2003 . higher revenue and lower operating expenses in q1 2004 were offset by higher costs for flash memory products as we sold higher density products . in addition , the impact of higher inventory write-offs primarily for certain applications and cellular processors offset the improvements in our operating results . Â   23 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   operating expenses Â   operating expenses for the first quarter of 2004 and 2003 were as follows : Â   ( in millions ) Â   Â   q1 Â   2004 Â   Â   q1 Â   2003 research and development Â   Â   $ Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   1 , 195 Â   Â   $ Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   1 , 019 marketing , general and administrative Â   Â   $ 1 , 141 Â   Â   $ 1 , 018 amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs Â   Â   $ 58 Â   Â   $ 84 Â   research and development spending increased $ 176 million , or 17 % , compared to q1 2003 . this increase was primarily due to higher expenses related to development for manufacturing process technologies , including the 65-nanometer process on 300-millimeter wafers and higher expenses for product development programs in the intel architecture business , as well as higher profit-dependent compensation expenses . marketing , general and administrative expenses were up $ 123 million , or 12 % , compared to q1 2003 primarily due to higher cooperative advertising expenses , as a result of higher revenue in our intel architecture business , and increased profit-dependent bonus expenses . research and development along with marketing , general and administrative expenses were 29 % of net revenue in q1 2004 and 30 % of net revenue in q1 2003 . Â   amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs was $ 58 million in q1 2004 compared to $ 84 million in q1 2003 , as a portion of the intangibles related to prior acquisitions became fully amortized . Â   gains ( losses ) on equity securities , interest and other , and taxes Â   gains ( losses ) on equity securities , net , interest and other , net and taxes for the first quarter of 2004 and 2003 were as follows : Â   ( in millions ) Â   Â   q1 2004 Â   Â   q1 2003 Â   gains ( losses ) on equity securities , net Â   Â   $ 19 Â   Â   $ Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( 127 ) interest and other , net Â   Â   $ 49 Â   Â   $ 52 Â   provision for taxes Â   Â   $ Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   814 Â   Â   $ 401 Â   Â   gains ( losses ) on equity securities and certain equity derivatives for q1 2004 was a net gain of $ 19 million compared to a net loss of $ 127 million for q1 2003 . the increase in q1 2004 was primarily attributed to lower impairment charges on non-marketable equity securities ( approximately $ 11 million in q1 2004 and $ 140 million in q1 2003 ) . the net gain in q1 2004 was also a result of higher gains on equity transactions . Â   our effective income tax rate was 32 . 0 % for q1 2004 , compared to 30 . 5 % for q1 2003 . the rate for 2004 is higher than the rate in the prior year primarily due to a higher percentage of profits being expected in higher-tax jurisdictions . Â   24 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   financial condition Â   our financial condition remains strong . at march 27 , 2004 , cash , short-term investments and fixed income instruments included in trading assets totaled $ 15 . 4 billion , down from $ 15 . 9 billion at december 27 , 2003 . total short-term and long-term debt was $ 1 . 2 billion and represented 3 % of stockholders Â ’ equity at both march 27 , 2004 , and december 27 , 2003 . Â   for the first quarter of 2004 , cash provided by operating activities was $ 1 . 8 billion ( $ 1 . 7 billion for the first quarter of 2003 ) . cash was provided by net income adjusted for non-cash related items . working capital uses of cash included increases in accounts receivable and inventories and decreases in accrued compensation and benefits and income taxes payable . accounts receivable increased over december 2003 levels , primarily due to a higher proportion of sales occurring toward the end of the current quarter . the days sales outstanding remained the same at 36 days . our three largest customers accounted for approximately 40 % of net revenue for the first quarter of 2004 , with one of these customers accounting for approximately 18 % of revenue and another customer accounting for approximately 15 % . for the first quarter of 2003 , our three largest customers accounted for approximately 40 % of net revenue . additionally , those three largest customers accounted for approximately 43 % of net accounts receivable at march 27 , 2004 and december 27 , 2003 . our inventory levels were higher by 11 % at the end of the first quarter of 2004 compared to december 2003 as yields improved and we ramped new products for sale in 2004 . accrued compensation and benefits decreased during the quarter as we paid year-end bonuses and made the annual cash contributions to our profit sharing plans . the decrease in the accrual for income taxes payable is due to higher tax payments in the first quarter of 2004 . Â   we used $ 929 million in net cash for investing activities during the first quarter of 2004 , compared to $ 927 million during the first quarter of 2003 . improved corporate credit profiles facilitated a slight shift in our portfolio of investments in debt securities to longer term maturities . capital expenditures decreased to $ 680 million in the first quarter of 2004 from $ 954 million in the first quarter of 2003 . we continued to invest in capital equipment and construction , primarily for additional microprocessor manufacturing capacity , but at a lower rate than in the same period for the prior year . Â   we used $ 1 . 3 billion in net cash for financing activities in the first quarter of 2004 , compared to $ 1 . 1 billion in the first quarter of 2003 . the major financing use of cash was for the repurchase of shares as we repurchased 49 . 2 million shares of common stock for $ 1 . 5 billion compared to 62 . 6 million shares for $ 1 . 0 billion in the same period in 2003 . as of march 27 , 2004 , approximately 365 million shares remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization . Â   additional financing uses of cash in the first quarter of 2004 included payments of dividends . in january 2004 , our board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $ 0 . 02 per share to $ 0 . 04 per share , effective for the first-quarter 2004 dividend . therefore , our dividend payments were $ 259 million in the first quarter of 2004 , higher than the $ 131 million paid in the same period of the prior year . financing sources of cash during the first quarter of 2004 were primarily $ 386 million in proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee stock plans ( $ 233 million during the first quarter of 2003 ) . Â   another potential source of liquidity is authorized borrowings , including commercial paper , of $ 3 . 0 billion . there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program during the first quarter of 2004 . we also maintain the ability to offer an aggregate of approximately $ 1 . 4 billion in debt , equity and other securities under u . s . securities and exchange commission ( sec ) shelf registration statements . Â   we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet our business requirements for the next twelve months , including capital expenditures for the expansion or upgrading of worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test capacity , working capital requirements , the dividend program , potential stock repurchases and potential future acquisitions or strategic investments . Â   25 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   employee stock options Â   our stock option program is a broad-based , long-term retention program that is intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests . the program currently consists of two plans : one under which officers , key employees and non-employee directors may be granted options to purchase shares of our stock , and a broad-based plan under which options may be granted to all employees other than officers and directors . substantially all of our employees participate in one of the plans . options granted by the company expire no later than 10 years from the grant date . options granted to existing and newly hired employees generally vest in increments over four or five years from the date of grant , and certain grants to key employees have delayed vesting generally beginning six years from the date of grant . our 1984 stock option plan , as amended , expires in may 2004 , and our 1997 stock option plan , as amended , expires in january 2007 . we are presently proposing a new equity incentive plan for stockholder vote at our may 2004 annual stockholders Â ’ meeting . contingent on stockholder approval , this new equity incentive plan would replace both the expiring 1984 plan and the 1997 plan , which would be terminated early . Â   we have a goal to keep the potential incremental dilution related to our option program to a long-term average of less than 2 % annually . the dilution percentage is calculated using the new option grants for the year , net of options forfeited by employees leaving the company and options expired , divided by the total outstanding shares at the beginning of the year . Â   options granted to employees , including officers , and non-employee directors from 2000 through the first quarter of 2004 are summarized as follows : Â   ( shares in millions ) Â   Â   ytd 2004 Â   Â   2003 Â   Â   2002 Â   Â   2001 Â   Â   2000 Â   total options granted1 Â   Â   4 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   110 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   174 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   238 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   163 Â   less options forfeited1 Â   Â   ( 7 ) Â   ( 40 ) Â   ( 44 ) Â   ( 47 ) Â   ( 31 ) net options granted ( forfeited ) Â   Â   ( 3 ) Â   70 Â   Â   130 Â   Â   191 Â   Â   132 Â   net grants as % of outstanding shares2 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   n / m Â   Â   1 . 1 % Â   1 . 9 % Â   2 . 8 % Â   2 . 0 % grants to listed officers3 as % of total options granted Â   Â   Â — Â   Â   2 . 4 % Â   1 . 7 % Â   0 . 8 % Â   0 . 4 % grants to listed officers as % of outstanding shares Â   Â   Â — Â   Â   < 0 . 1 % Â   < 0 . 1 % Â   < 0 . 1 % Â   < 0 . 1 % cumulative options held by listed officers as % of total options outstanding Â   Â   2 . 1 % Â   2 . 1 % Â   2 . 1 % Â   2 . 0 % Â   2 . 4 % 1excluding options assumed in connection with acquisitions . 2outstanding shares as of the beginning of each period . 3 Â “ listed officers Â ” for 2004 are those listed in our proxy statement dated march 31 , 2004 , defined as our chief executive officer and each of the four other most highly compensated executive officers .

Â   3 total excludes 8 . 2 million shares issuable under outstanding options , with a weighted average exercise price of $ 16 . 72 , originally granted under plans we assumed in connection with acquisitions . we do not intend to grant any further options under these plans . Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   28 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   business outlook Â   as we look ahead to the rest of 2004 , we are planning for growth in annual revenue made possible by an improved economic climate , and further progress in gross margin . for the second quarter of 2004 , we expect revenue to be between $ 7 . 6 billion and $ 8 . 2 billion , compared to first quarter revenue of $ 8 . 1 billion . the midpoint of this range would be a sequential decline of slightly more than 2 % , which is consistent with the average pattern for what tends to be our most variable quarter . the outlook for the communications industry continues to be soft . in this environment , revenue growth for our networking and communications business is largely dependent on our securing design wins for new products , oems taking those product designs to production and continued use of those product designs by oems . demand for our flash memory products is uncertain in the highly competitive cellular handset market segment . revenue growth for our flash memory products is largely dependent on customer demand for higher density flash memory and continued end user adoption of new leading-edge cellular handsets . Â   our financial results are substantially dependent on sales of microprocessors and related components by the intel architecture operating segment . revenue is partly a function of the mix of microprocessor types and speeds sold as well as the mix of related chipsets and motherboards , all of which are difficult to forecast . because of the wide price differences among desktop , mobile and server microprocessors , the mix of types and speeds of microprocessors sold affects the average selling price that we will realize and has a large impact on our revenue and gross margin . microprocessor revenue is also dependent on the availability of other parts of the system platform , including chipsets , motherboards , operating system software and application software . revenue is also affected by our sales of other semiconductor and non-semiconductor products and is subject to the impact of economic conditions in various geographic regions . Â   we expect the gross margin percentage in the second quarter of 2004 to be approximately 60 % , plus or minus a couple of points , flat compared to 60 . 2 % in the first quarter , which includes the charge for the settlement agreement with intergraph corporation . in addition , the second quarter of 2004 is expected to have lower revenue and increased start-up costs compared to the first quarter . for the full year of 2004 , our gross margin is expected to be 62 % , plus or minus a few points . our gross margin should benefit from the productive use of 90-nanometer technology and 300mm wafers , as we build more of our mainstream products with these technologies . our gross margin varies primarily with revenue levels , which are dependent on unit volumes and prices , as well as the mix of types and speeds of processors sold , and the mix of microprocessors , related chipsets and motherboards , and other semiconductor and non-semiconductor products . variability of other factors will also continue to affect cost of sales and the gross margin percentage , including unit costs and yield issues associated with production at our factories , timing and execution of the manufacturing ramp including the ramp of the 90-nanometer process technology on 300mm wafers , excess of manufacturing capacity , the reusability of factory equipment , impairment of manufacturing or assembly and test assets , excess inventory , inventory obsolescence and variations in inventory valuation . Â   we have significantly expanded our semiconductor manufacturing and assembly and test capacity over the last few years , and we continue to plan capacity based on the assumed continued success of our overall strategy and the acceptance of our products in specific market segments . we currently expect that capital spending will be between $ 3 . 6 billion and $ 4 . 0 billion in 2004 , compared to $ 3 . 7 billion in 2003 . the midpoint of this range , $ 3 . 8 billion , is only slightly higher than 2003 . this capital-spending plan is dependent on expectations regarding production efficiencies and delivery times of various machinery and equipment , and construction schedules for new facilities . if the demand for our products does not grow and continue to move toward higher performance products in the various market segments , revenue and gross margin would be adversely affected and manufacturing and / or assembly and test capacity would be under-utilized , and the rate of capital spending could be further reduced . we could be required to record an impairment of our manufacturing or assembly and test equipment and / or facilities , or factory planning decisions may cause us to record accelerated depreciation . however , in the long term , revenue and gross margin may also be affected if we do not add capacity fast enough to meet market demand . Â   we expect depreciation expense to be between $ 1 . 1 billion and $ 1 . 2 billion for the second quarter of 2004 and $ 4 . 6 billion for the full year 2004 . Â   29 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   spending on research and development , plus marketing , general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2004 is expected to be approximately $ 2 . 4 billion , slightly higher than the first quarter primarily due to annual wage increases that took effect on april 1 , 2004 . expenses , particularly certain marketing and compensation-related expenses , may vary from this expectation , depending in part on the level of revenue and profits . Â   research and development spending is expected to be approximately $ 4 . 8 billion in 2004 . Â   based on acquisitions completed through april 28 , 2004 , we expect amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs to be approximately $ 40 million in the second quarter and $ 170 million for the full year 2004 . we review our acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of potential impairment exist . Â   we expect the net gains from equity securities and interest and other for the second quarter of 2004 to be approximately $ 60 million . this is primarily due to an expected net gain on equity securities of approximately $ 20 million as well as expected net interest income . our expectations for gains ( losses ) from equity securities include impairment charges on private equity investments . this expectation for impairments in the second quarter is based on our experience and it is not possible to know at the present time which specific investments are likely to be impaired or the extent or timing of individual impairments . in addition , our expectations for gains or losses from equity securities and interest and other assume no unanticipated events and vary depending on equity market levels and volatility , gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities , interest rates , cash balances , and changes in the fair value of derivative instruments . Â   at march 27 , 2004 , we held non-marketable equity securities with a carrying value of $ 661 million . if the level of ipo market activity does not increase and the availability of venture capital funding for technology investments does not improve , our non-marketable investments may be adversely affected . as companies within our portfolio attempt to raise additional funds , the funds may not be available to them or they may receive lower valuations , with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings , and our investments would likely become impaired . however , we are not able determine at the present time which specific investments are likely to be impaired in the future , or the extent or timing of individual impairments . Â   we currently expect our effective tax rate for 2004 to be approximately 32 % . the estimated effective tax rate is based on current tax law and the current expected income , and assumes the company continues to receive the tax benefit for export sales ( see Â “ note 13 : contingencies Â ” in notes to consolidated condensed financial statements ) . the tax rate may be affected by the closing of acquisitions or divestitures , the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed , and the ability to realize deferred tax assets . Â   as of march 27 , 2004 , we have approximately $ 3 . 7 billion of goodwill remaining on our balance sheet , of which $ 3 . 2 billion is related to the icg operating segment and $ 533 million is related to the intel architecture operating segment . specifically for icg , if we fail to deliver new products , if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance , or if market conditions in the communications business fail to improve , our revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and we may incur additional charges for impairment of goodwill . Â   we are currently a party to various legal proceedings and claims , including claims related to taxes . management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations . however , litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur . an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages , additional taxes owed or , in cases where injunctive relief is sought , an injunction prohibiting intel from selling one or more products . if an unfavorable ruling were to occur in any specific period , there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations of that period or future periods . management believes that , given our current liquidity and cash and investment balances , even an adverse judgment would not have a material impact on cash and investments or liquidity . Â   we operate globally , with sales offices and research and development as well as manufacturing and assembly and test facilities in many countries , and , as a result , we are subject to risks and factors associated with doing business outside the u . s . global Â   operations involve inherent risks that include currency controls and fluctuations , tariff and import regulations , Â   30 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   and regulatory requirements that may limit our or our customers Â ’ ability to manufacture , assemble and test , design , develop or sell products in particular countries . if terrorist activity , armed conflict , civil or military unrest , or political instability occurs in the u . s . , israel or other locations , such events may disrupt manufacturing , assembly and test , logistics , security and communications , and could also result in reduced demand for intel Â ’ s products . the impacts of major health concerns , or of large-scale outages or interruptions of service from utility or other infrastructure providers , on intel , its suppliers , customers or other third parties could also adversely affect our business and impact customer order patterns . we could also be affected if labor issues disrupt our transportation arrangements or those of our customers or suppliers . on a worldwide basis , we regularly review our key infrastructure , systems , services and suppliers , both internally and externally , to seek to identify significant vulnerabilities as well as areas of potential business impact if a disruptive event were to occur . once identified , we assess the risks , and as we consider it to be appropriate , we initiate actions intended to reduce the risks and their potential impact . however , there can be no assurance that we have identified all significant risks or that we can mitigate all identified risks with reasonable effort . Â   our future results of operations and the other forward-looking statements contained in this filing , including this md & a , involve a number of risks and uncertainties Â — in particular , the statements regarding our goals and strategies , new product introductions , plans to cultivate new businesses , market segment share and growth rate assumptions , future economic conditions and recovery in the communications businesses , revenue , pricing , gross margin and costs , capital spending , depreciation and amortization , research and development expenses , potential impairment of investments , the tax rate and pending tax and legal proceedings . in addition to various factors that we have discussed above , a number of other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations . demand for our products , which impacts our revenue and gross margin percentage , is affected by business and economic conditions , as well as computing and communications industry trends and the development and timing of introduction of compelling software applications and operating systems that take advantage of the features of our products . demand for our products is also affected by changes in customer order patterns , such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by our customers and the timing of customer purchases . revenue and gross margin could also be affected by competitive factors , such as competing chip architectures and manufacturing technologies , competing software-compatible microprocessors , pricing pressures and other competitive factors , as well as market acceptance of our new products in specific market segments , the availability of sufficient inventory to meet demand and the availability of externally purchased components or materials . our future revenue is also dependent on continuing technological advancement , including developing and implementing new processes and strategic products , as well as the timing of new product introductions , sustaining and growing new businesses , and integrating and operating any acquired businesses . our results could also be affected by adverse effects associated with product defects and errata ( deviations from published specifications ) and by litigation involving intellectual property , stockholder , consumer and other issues . Â   we believe that we have the product offerings , facilities , personnel , and competitive and financial resources for continued business success , but future revenue , costs , margins and profits are all influenced by a number of factors , including those discussed above , all of which are inherently difficult to forecast . Â   31 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   status of business outlook and scheduled business update Â   we expect that our corporate representatives will from time to time meet privately with investors , investment analysts , the media and others , and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the Â “ business outlook Â ” section and elsewhere in this form 10-q , including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this form 10-q . at the same time , we will keep this form 10-q and our then current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site ( www . intc . com ) . the public can continue to rely on the business outlook published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered , unless we publish a notice stating otherwise . the statements in business outlook and other forward-looking statements in this form 10-q are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and sec filings , our mid-quarter business updates and at other times . Â   we intend to publish a mid-quarter business update on june 3 , 2004 . from the close of business on may 28 , 2004 until publication of the update , we will observe a Â “ quiet period Â ” during which the business outlook and other forward-looking statements published in our earnings press releases on january 14 , 2004 and april 13 , 2004 , as reiterated or updated , as applicable , in our filings with the sec on forms 10-k and 10-q , should be considered historical , speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update . during the quiet period , our representatives will not comment on the business outlook or our financial results or expectations . Â   a quiet period operating in similar fashion with regard to the business outlook and our sec filings will begin at the close of business on june 11 , 2004 and will extend until the day when our next quarterly earnings release is published , presently scheduled for july 13 , 2004 .

< date > 2003-09-27 < / date > < price > 27 . 27 < / price > < company > intc < / company > Â   the Â “ strategy , Â ” Â “ critical accounting estimates Â ” and Â “ outlook Â ” sections contain a number of forward-looking statements , all of which are based on current expectations . actual results may differ materially based on a variety of factors , including those discussed below under Â “ outlook . Â ” these statements do not reflect the potential impact of any mergers , acquisitions , divestitures or other business combinations that had not closed as of october 31 , 2003 . Â   strategy Â   our goal is to be the preeminent building block supplier to the worldwide internet economy . focusing on our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits , as well as our expertise in digital computing and communications , we believe we are well positioned to drive the convergence of computing and communications through silicon integration . we focus on developing advanced technology solutions tailored to meet user requirements in specific settings , providing the features people want in their homes , at work and at play . we also provide key components for the networking and communications infrastructure needed to connect technology users . each of our operating segments uses its core competencies , as well as key silicon architectures , to provide building blocks for technology solutions . the intel architecture business provides the advanced technologies to support the desktop , mobile and enterprise platforms . our wireless communications and computing group ( wccg ) focuses on component-level products and solutions for the wireless handheld communications and computing market segments . finally , our intel communications group ( icg ) focuses on wired and wireless connectivity products and provides key components for networking and communications infrastructure devices . Â   all of our businesses operate in highly innovative environments characterized by continuing and rapid introduction of new products offering improved performance at lower prices . as part of our overall strategy , we compete vigorously in each relevant market segment using our core competencies , as well as our global presence and brand recognition . we also strategically invest through our intel capital program to create new business opportunities and expand markets for our products . our competition comes from established businesses as well as new entrants to the marketplace . with the trend toward convergence in computing and communications products , product offerings will likely cross over multiple categories , offering us new opportunities , but also resulting in more businesses that compete with us . competition tends to increase pricing pressure on our products , which may mean that we must offer our products at lower prices than we had anticipated , resulting in lower profits . because some of our competitors already have established products and product designs , it is inherently difficult for us to compete against them . in addition , certain market segments in which we compete , such as networking and telecommunications products , have experienced an overall economic decline , increasing the degree of competition for the remaining business within these market segments . when we believe it is appropriate , we will take various steps , including introducing new products and discontinuing older products , reducing prices , and offering rebates and other incentives in order to increase acceptance of our latest products and to be competitive within each relevant market segment . Â   we plan to cultivate new businesses and work with the computing and communications industry through standards bodies , trade associations , original equipment manufacturers ( oems ) and independent software vendors , to align the industry to offer products that take advantage of convergence . these efforts include helping to create the infrastructure for wireless network connectivity , and working with the industry to develop compelling software applications and operating systems , to take advantage of our microprocessors , chipsets and other next-generation semiconductor devices with higher performance or advanced features , including advanced technology capabilities integrated at the silicon level . Â   intel architecture business Â   the intel architecture business supports the desktop , mobile and enterprise platforms . for the desktop platform , our strategy is to introduce microprocessors and chipsets with ever-higher performance and advanced technology features , tailored for the different market segments of the worldwide computing market , using a tiered branding approach . for the mobile platform , our strategy is to deliver products optimized for the four mobility vectors : performance , battery life , form factor and wireless connectivity . the desktop and mobile platforms are based on the ia-32 architecture . our strategy for the enterprise platform is to provide high-performance processors and the best price for performance across the entire range of server and workstation market segments . Â   18 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   for the desktop performance market segment , we offer the intel Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â   for the mobile market segment , we offer processors optimized for transportable , full size , thin and light , and ultra-portable notebook pcs . in 2003 , we introduced intel Â ® Â ™ Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â   the intel architecture business also supports the enterprise platform by offering products that address various levels of data processing and computing intensive applications . our intel Â ® Â ™ Â ® Â ® Â ® Â   for the enterprise-class market segment , we currently offer the intel Â ® Â ® Â   we believe that technology industry product developments and the convergence of computing and communications will increase demand for our higher performance enterprise platform products . in particular , we anticipate increased demand for our products to support new developments in data traffic management , storage and wired and wireless computing and communications needs . Â   19 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   our microprocessor business generally has followed a seasonal trend ; however , there can be no assurance that this trend will continue . in four of the past five years , the company Â ’ s sales of microprocessors were higher in the second half of the year , primarily due to back-to-school and holiday demand . Â   wireless communications and computing group Â   within wccg , our strategy is to deliver complete solutions that enable quick deployment of applications and services for wireless internet and handheld communication and computing devices . the intel Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â ® Â   intel communications group Â   within icg , our strategy is to be the leading supplier of communications silicon building blocks for oems . we are developing products that we believe are essential to build out the internet : products designed for wired and wireless applications , including optical products and network processing components . our strategy for ethernet connectivity is to expand our product portfolio in the local area network ( lan ) market segment and to address the emerging metropolitan area network ( man ) and networked storage market segments . within the lan and man market segments , we are investing in gigabit ethernet , 10-gigabit ethernet and wireless technologies based on industry standards for wireless 802 . 11 mobile applications and the emerging standard supporting 802 . 16 ( or wimax ) for broadband connectivity . in the networked storage market segment , we are developing products that allow storage resources to be added to any location on either of the two most prevalent types of storage networks : ethernet or fibre channel . for the optical market segment , our strategy is to deliver products based on industry standards , including ethernet and data transport standards in the telecommunications industry ( sonet / sdh ) . we are providing 10-gigabit optical products at multiple levels of integration with decreased power consumption and increased signal transmission capability . in network processing , we deliver products that are basic building blocks for modular networking infrastructure . these products include advanced , programmable processors that are used to manage and direct data moving across the internet and corporate networks . the transition to our 90-nanometer manufacturing process is a key factor in our execution of these strategies . the 90-nanometer manufacturing process is expected to enable many of our communications products to feature Â “ mixed-signal Â ” circuitry and high-speed transistors , aimed at creating a new generation of faster , more integrated , less costly communications chips . as we transition to this new process , we expect to build more of our communications products internally . currently , third-party foundry manufacturers perform a significant portion of icg Â ’ s manufacturing . Â   20 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   critical accounting estimates Â   the methods , estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements . some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments , often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain . our most critical accounting estimates include the assessment of recoverability of goodwill , which impacts write-offs of goodwill ; valuation of non-marketable equity securities , which impacts net gains ( losses ) on equity securities when we record impairments ; valuation of inventory , which impacts gross margin ; assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets , which primarily impacts gross margin when we impair assets or accelerate their depreciation ; and recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities , which impacts our tax provision . below , we discuss these policies further , as well as the estimates and judgments involved . we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies , such as our policies for revenue recognition , including the deferral of revenues on sales to distributors ; however , these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective . Â   goodwill . Â   non-marketable equity securities Â   we invest in companies that develop software , hardware and other technologies or provide services supporting technologies . our current investment focus areas include : enabling mobile and internet client devices , creating the digital home , advancing high performance communications infrastructure and developing the next generation of silicon production technologies . our focus areas tend to develop and change over time due to rapid advancements in technology . Â   we typically invest in non-marketable equity securities of private companies and contribute a portion of the funds required for them to grow . our investment portfolio ranges from early stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies whose products or technologies may directly support an intel product or initiative . we invest primarily for strategic reasons , but we also consider potential financial returns . the program seeks to invest in companies and businesses that can succeed and have an impact on their market segment . however , these types of investments involve a great deal of risk , and there can be no assurance that any specific company , whether at an early or mature stage or somewhere in between , will grow or will become successful , and consequently , we could lose all or part of our investment . when the strategic objectives of an investment have been achieved , or if the investment or business diverges from our strategic objectives , we may decide to dispose of the investment . however , our investments in non-marketable equity securities are illiquid and there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of these investments on favorable terms or at all . Â   21 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   our ability to recover our strategic investments in non-marketable equity securities and to earn a return on these investments is primarily dependent on how successfully these companies are able to execute to their business plans and how well their products are accepted , as well as their ability to obtain venture capital funding to continue operations , to grow and to take advantage of liquidity events . in the current equity market environment , their ability to obtain additional funding as well as to take advantage of liquidity events , such as initial public offerings ( ipos ) , mergers and private sales , is significantly constrained . Â   we review all of our investments periodically for impairment ; however , for non-marketable equity securities , the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment . the indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances include ( a ) the investees Â ’ revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business prospects , ( b ) the technological feasibility of the investee Â ’ s products and technologies , ( c ) the general market conditions in the investee Â ’ s industry , and ( d ) the investee Â ’ s liquidity , debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash . Â   investments identified as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired , in which case we write the investment down to its impaired value . when an investee is not considered viable from a financial or technological point of view , we write off the entire investment since we consider the estimated fair market value to be nominal . if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount or requires a new round of equity funding to stay in operation and the new funding does not appear imminent , we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired , unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise . Â   we have experienced substantial impairments in our portfolio of non-marketable equity securities as equity markets declined significantly over the past few years . if the level of ipo market activity does not increase and the availability of venture capital funding for technology investments does not improve , our non-marketable investments may be adversely affected . as companies within our portfolio attempt to raise additional funds , the funds may not be available to them or they may receive lower valuations , with more onerous investment terms than in previous financings , and the investments would likely become impaired . however , we are not able to determine at the present time which specific investments are likely to be impaired in the future , or the extent or timing of individual impairments . Â   inventory . Â   long-lived assets . Â   22 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   due to our asset usage model and the fungible nature of our semiconductor manufacturing and assembly and test capacity , we must make subjective judgments in determining the asset groupings and the related independent cash flows for the asset recoverability test . in addition , as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions , we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets , primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing and assembly and test tools and building improvements . when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated , and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the assets , we accelerate the rate of depreciation charges in order to fully depreciate the assets over their new , shorter , useful lives . Â   income taxes . Â   we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets . if recovery is not likely , we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable . as of september 27 , 2003 , we believe that all of the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be recovered . however , should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets , our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable . Â   in addition , the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations . we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states ( u . s . ) and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether , and the extent to which , additional taxes will be due . if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary , we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary . we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period we determine that the original estimate of a tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be . see Â “ note 18 : contingencies Â ” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements for a discussion of current tax matters .

Â   all of our geographic regions experienced increased revenue in q3 2003 compared to q3 2002 , led by growth in the emerging markets in both asia and europe as well as strength in japan . our asia-pacific region Â ’ s revenue comprised the largest portion of our total revenue and increased 31 % , reflecting growth in local consumption and asia Â ’ s continued growth as a global manufacturing and design center . japan experienced substantial improvement with an increase of 73 % , europe increased 12 % , and the americas region increased 3 % . Â   our overall gross margin percentage increased to 58 . 2 % for q3 2003 from 48 . 8 % in q3 2002 . improved gross margin within the intel architecture business as well as a shift in the total company revenue mix to the higher-margin intel architecture business contributed to our improved total gross margin . improvement in the intel architecture gross margin was partially offset by a decline in the gross margin percentage for wccg . the gross margin percentage for icg was flat in q3 2003 compared to q3 2002 . see Â “ outlook Â ” for a discussion of gross margin expectations . Â   24 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   intel architecture business Â   the revenue and operating income for the intel architecture operating segment for the third quarter of 2003 and 2002 were as follows : Â   ( in millions ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   q3 2003 Â   Â   q3 2002 microprocessor revenue Â   Â   $ Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   5 , 698 Â   Â   $ Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   4 , 518 chipset , motherboard and other revenue Â   Â   Â   1 , 140 Â   Â   Â   889 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   total revenue Â   Â   $ 6 , 838 Â   Â   $ 5 , 407 operating income Â   Â   $ 2 , 915 Â   Â   $ 1 , 414 Â   net revenue for the intel architecture operating segment increased $ 1 . 4 billion , or 26 % , in q3 2003 compared to q3 2002 . revenue from sales of microprocessors increased 26 % while revenue from sales of chipsets and motherboards increased 28 % . the increase in revenue was primarily due to significantly higher unit sales of microprocessors and chipsets in q3 2003 , and to a lesser extent higher average selling prices and a richer product mix for microprocessors . Â   operating income increased $ 1 . 5 billion , or 106 % in q3 2003 , compared to q3 2002 . the increase was primarily due to the impact of higher revenue and lower unit costs for microprocessors and chipsets . Â   wireless communications and computing group Â   the revenue and operating loss for the wccg operating segment for the third quarter of 2003 and 2002 were as follows : Â   ( in millions ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   q3 2003 Â   Â   q3 2002 Â   revenue Â   Â   $ Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   450 Â   Â   $ Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   586 Â   operating loss Â   Â   $ ( 124 ) Â   $ ( 30 ) Â   net revenue decreased by $ 136 million , or 23 % , in q3 2003 compared to q3 2002 due to lower unit sales of flash memory products . despite a shift in product mix to higher-density products , the pricing environment for flash memory products remained difficult and we continued to experience the negative impacts of our pricing strategy on certain products . Â   the operating loss increased to a loss of $ 124 million in q3 2003 compared to a loss of $ 30 million in q3 2002 primarily due to lower revenue from flash memory products . Â   intel communications group Â   the revenue and operating loss for the icg operating segment for the third quarter of 2003 and 2002 were as follows : Â   ( in millions ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   q3 2003 Â   Â   q3 2002 Â   revenue Â   Â   $ Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   544 Â   Â   $ Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   482 Â   operating loss Â   Â   $ ( 94 ) Â   $ ( 177 ) Â   net revenue increased by $ 62 million , or 13 % , in q3 2003 compared to q3 2002 , primarily due to increased revenue from sales of embedded control chips and wireless ethernet connection products . Â   25 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   the operating loss decreased to $ 94 million in q3 2003 from a $ 177 million loss in q3 2002 primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses of $ 59 million as we continued our efforts to streamline operations and refocus on our core strategic areas . higher revenue from embedded control chips also improved operating results . these improvements were partially offset by the mix shift to lower-margin wired ethernet connections . in the current competitive environment , sales of wireless ethernet products in support of expanded adoption of the intel centrino mobile technology increased the operating loss in q3 2003 . Â   operating expenses Â   operating expenses for the third quarter of 2003 and 2002 were as follows : Â   ( in millions ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   q3 2003 Â   Â   q3 2002 research and development Â   Â   $ Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   1 , 135 Â   Â   $ Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   1 , 006 marketing , general and administrative Â   Â   $ 1 , 046 Â   Â   $ 1 , 095 amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs Â   Â   $ 68 Â   Â   $ 102 purchased in-process research and development Â   Â   $ 5 Â   Â   $ 6 Â   research and development spending increased $ 129 million , or 13 % , compared to q3 2002 . this increase was primarily due to higher profit-dependent compensation expenses and higher expenses for product development programs in the intel architecture business , as well as higher expenses related to development for manufacturing process technologies , including the 65-nanometer process on 300-millimeter wafers . marketing , general and administrative expenses were down $ 49 million , or 4 % , compared to q3 2002 primarily due to lower discretionary spending and lower expenses as we reduced headcount and refocused on core strategic areas . in addition , we incurred lower cooperative advertising expenses , despite an increase in revenue , because our customers used a lower percentage of their available intel inside Â ® Â   amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs was $ 68 million in q3 2003 compared to $ 102 million in q3 2002 , as a portion of the intangibles related to prior acquisitions became fully amortized . Â   losses on equity securities , interest and other , and taxes Â   losses on equity securities , net , interest and other , net and taxes for the second quarter of 2003 and 2002 were as follows : Â   ( in millions ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   q3 2003 Â   Â   q3 2002 Â   losses on equity securities , net Â   Â   $ Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( 63 ) Â   $ Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ( 96 ) interest and other , net Â   Â   $ 34 Â   Â   $ 49 Â   provision for taxes Â   Â   $ 618 Â   Â   $ 231 Â   Â   losses on equity securities and certain equity derivatives for q3 2003 were $ 63 million compared to $ 96 million for q3 2002 . the net loss for both periods was primarily due to impairment charges on non-marketable equity securities ( approximately $ 92 million for q3 2003 and approximately $ 83 million for q3 2002 ) . the impairment charges in q3 2003 were partially offset by mark-to-market gains and realized gains on equity investments . Â   our effective income tax rate was 27 . 2 % for q3 2003 , compared to 25 . 2 % for q3 2002 . the effective rate for q3 2003 reflects a tax benefit of $ 125 million related to a divestiture . this tax benefit was more than offset by an increase in taxes due to a higher percentage of profits being expected in higher-tax jurisdictions in 2003 compared to 2002 .

Â   our effective income tax rate was 28 . 7 % for the first nine months of 2003 , compared to 27 . 6 % for the first nine months of 2002 . the rate for the first nine months of 2003 reflects tax benefits of $ 138 million related to divestitures . this tax benefit was more than offset by an increase in taxes due to a higher percentage of profits being expected in higher-tax jurisdictions in 2003 compared to 2002 . Â   30 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   financial condition Â   our financial condition remains strong . at september 27 , 2003 , cash , short-term investments and fixed income instruments included in trading assets totaled $ 15 . 2 billion , up from $ 12 . 2 billion at december 28 , 2002 . at september 27 , 2003 , total short-term and long-term debt was $ 1 . 2 billion and represented 3 . 3 % of stockholders Â ’ equity . at december 28 , 2002 , total debt of $ 1 . 4 billion represented 3 . 8 % of stockholders Â ’ equity . Â   for the first nine months of 2003 , cash provided by operating activities was $ 7 . 5 billion ( $ 5 . 6 billion for the first nine months of 2002 ) . cash was provided by net income adjusted for non-cash related items . working capital uses of cash included an increase in accounts receivable . working capital sources of cash included increases in accounts payable and accrued income taxes payable . accounts receivable increased over december 2002 levels , primarily due to higher revenue and a higher proportion of sales occurring toward the end of the third quarter compared to the end of the fourth quarter of 2002 . the days Â ’ sales outstanding also increased from december 2002 from 34 days to 37 days . our three largest customers accounted for approximately 41 % of net revenue for the first nine months of 2003 . additionally , these three largest customers accounted for approximately 44 % of net accounts receivable at september 27 , 2003 . Â   we used $ 3 . 6 billion in net cash for investing activities during the first nine months of 2003 , compared to $ 4 . 0 billion during the first nine months of 2002 , as capital expenditures decreased to $ 2 . 9 billion in the first nine months of 2003 from $ 3 . 5 billion in the first nine months of 2002 . we continued to invest in capital equipment and construction , primarily for additional microprocessor manufacturing capacity , but at a lower rate than in the same period for the prior year . the company used $ 450 million in cash to acquire stock rights exchangeable into approximately 33 . 9 million shares of micron technology , inc . during the third quarter of 2003 . Â   we used $ 1 . 9 billion in net cash for financing activities in the first nine months of 2003 , compared to $ 2 . 9 Â   billion in the first nine months of 2002 . this decrease was primarily a result of less cash used for the repurchase of shares as we purchased 114 . 4 million shares of common stock for $ 2 . 0 billion compared to repurchases of 124 . 7 million shares for $ 3 . 0 billion during the same period in 2002 . during the third quarter of 2003 , we did not repurchase any shares and in the third quarter of 2002 , we repurchased 56 . 6 million shares for $ 1 . 0 billion . from september 28 , 2003 through october 31 , 2003 , we repurchased 23 million shares at a cost of $ 732 million . at october 31 , 2003 , approximately 452 million shares remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization . Â   additional financing uses of cash in the first nine months of 2003 included payments of dividends and debt repayments . we paid dividends of $ 393 million , with a similar amount paid in the same period of the prior year . debt repayments in 2003 primarily reflected redemption of bonds issued by the puerto rico industrial , tourist , educational , medical and environmental control facilities financing authority , as well as the payment of short-term balances related to securities lending transactions . financing sources of cash during the first nine months of 2003 were primarily $ 712 million in proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee stock plans ( $ 615 million during the first nine months of 2002 ) . Â   another potential source of liquidity is authorized borrowings , including commercial paper , of $ 3 . 0 billion . maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during the first nine months of 2003 were approximately $ 30 million , although no commercial paper was outstanding at the end of the period . we also maintain the ability to offer an aggregate of approximately $ 1 . 4 billion in debt , equity and other securities under u . s . securities and exchange commission ( sec ) shelf registration statements . Â   we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet our business requirements for the next twelve months , including capital expenditures for the expansion or upgrading of worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test capacity , working capital requirements , the dividend program and potential future acquisitions or strategic investments . Â   31 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   employee stock options Â   our stock option program is a broad-based , long-term retention program that is intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests . the program currently consists of two plans : one under which officers , key employees and non-employee directors may be granted options to purchase shares of our stock , and a broad-based plan under which options may be granted to all employees other than officers and directors . substantially all of our employees participate in one of the plans . options granted by the company expire no later than 10 years from the grant date . during the first nine months of 2003 , options granted to existing and newly hired employees generally vest in increments over 4 or 5 years from the date of grant , and certain grants to key employees have delayed vesting generally beginning 6 years from the date of grant . Â   we have a goal to keep the potential incremental dilution related to our option program to a long-term average of less than 2 % annually . the dilution percentage is calculated using the new option grants for the year , net of options forfeited by employees leaving the company and options expired , divided by the total outstanding shares at the beginning of the year . Â   options granted to employees , including officers , and non-employee directors from 1999 through the first nine months of 2003 are summarized as follows : Â   ( shares in millions ) Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   ytd Â   Â   2002 Â   Â   2001 Â   Â   2000 Â   Â   1999 Â   total options granted1 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   97 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   174 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   238 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   163 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   81 Â   less options forfeited1 Â   Â   ( 36 ) Â   ( 44 ) Â   ( 47 ) Â   ( 31 ) Â   ( 25 ) net options granted Â   Â   61 Â   Â   130 Â   Â   191 Â   Â   132 Â   Â   56 Â   net grants as % of outstanding shares2 Â   Â   0 . 9 % Â   1 . 9 % Â   2 . 8 % Â   2 . 0 % Â   1 . 2 % grants to listed officers3 as % of total options granted Â   Â   2 . 6 % Â   1 . 7 % Â   0 . 8 % Â   0 . 4 % Â   0 . 9 % grants to listed officers as % of outstanding shares2 Â   Â   < 0 . 1 % Â   < 0 . 1 % Â   < 0 . 1 % Â   < 0 . 1 % Â   < 0 . 1 % cumulative options held by listed officers as % of total options outstanding Â   Â   2 . 1 % Â   2 . 1 % Â   2 . 0 % Â   2 . 4 % Â   2 . 9 % Â   1excluding options assumed in connection with acquisitions . 2outstanding shares as of the beginning of each period . 3 Â “ listed officers Â ” for 2003 are those listed in our proxy statement dated april 2 , 2003 , defined as our chief executive officer and each of the four other most highly compensated executive officers . leslie vadasz , executive vice president and president , intel capital , retired effective june 1 , 2003 . mr . vadasz is included as a listed officer , consistent with our proxy statement dated april 2 , 2003 . stock option activity through september 27 , 2003 , including grants , exercises , forfeitures and cancellations , includes mr . vadasz Â ’ s stock option activity . Â   in accordance with a policy established by the compensation committee of the board of directors , total options granted to the listed officers may not exceed 5 % of total options granted in any year . for the first nine months of 2003 , options granted to listed officers amounted to 2 . 6 % of the grants made to all employees . in 2003 and 2002 , we made grants to key officers , including listed officers , and other senior-level employees in recognition of their future potential in leading the company . all stock option grants are made after a review by , and with the approval of , the compensation committee . all members of the compensation committee are independent directors , as defined in the applicable rules for issuers traded on the nasdaq stock market * .

Â   2 shares available under our 1997 stock option plan , used for grants to employees other than officers and directors . the board of directors has adopted a policy that any new option plans , and any material amendments to existing plans , will be submitted for stockholder approval . Â   3 total excludes 10 . 7 million shares issuable under outstanding options , with a weighted average exercise price of $ 16 . 15 , originally granted under plans we assumed in connection with acquisitions . we do not intend to grant any further options under these plans . Â   34 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   outlook Â   although uncertainty in global economic conditions continues to make it difficult to predict product demand , we believe the fourth quarter of 2003 will reflect a seasonal increase in revenue from an exceptionally strong base in the third quarter . for the fourth quarter of 2003 , we expect revenue to be between $ 8 . 1 billion and $ 8 . 7 billion , compared to third quarter revenue of $ 7 . 8 billion . the midpoint of this range would be up approximately 7 % compared to the third quarter of 2003 , consistent with seasonal patterns . in the previous five years , revenue growth in the fourth quarter has ranged from flat to up 13 % and averaged slightly over 8 % . our expectations assume continued strength in our intel architecture business . demand for our flash memory products remains uncertain in the highly competitive cellular handset market segment . revenue growth for the wireless communications and computing group ( wccg ) is largely dependent on the trend toward higher density flash memory products and continued end-user adoption of new leading-edge wireless handsets . revenue growth for the intel communications group ( icg ) is largely dependent on the demand for wireless ethernet connectivity products as well as our securing design wins for new products , and oems taking these product designs to production . the outlook for the telecommunications industry continues to be weak . Â   our financial results are substantially dependent on sales of microprocessors and related components by the intel architecture operating segment . revenue is partly a function of the mix of microprocessor types and speeds sold as well as the mix of related chipsets and motherboards , all of which are difficult to forecast . because of the wide price differences among performance desktop , value desktop , mobile and server microprocessors , the mix of types and speeds of microprocessors sold affects the average selling price that we will realize and has a large impact on our revenue and gross margin . microprocessor revenue is also dependent on the availability of other parts of the system platform , including chipsets , motherboards , operating system software and application software . revenue is also affected by our sales of other semiconductor and non-semiconductor products and is subject to the impact of economic conditions in various geographic regions . Â   we expect the gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter of 2003 to be approximately 60 % , plus or minus a couple of points , as compared to 58 . 2 % in the third quarter . the midpoint of this range represents an increase primarily driven by higher revenue , as we spread our fixed costs over more units . our gross margin varies primarily with revenue levels , which are dependent on unit volumes and prices , as well as the mix of types and speeds of processors sold , and the mix of microprocessors , related chipsets and motherboards , and other semiconductor and non-semiconductor products . variability of other factors will also continue to affect cost of sales and the gross margin percentage , including unit costs and yield issues associated with production at our factories , timing and execution of the manufacturing ramp , including the ramp of the 90-nanometer process technology on 300mm wafers , excess of manufacturing capacity , the reusability of factory equipment , impairment of manufacturing or assembly and test assets , excess inventory , inventory obsolescence and variations in inventory valuation . Â   we have significantly expanded our semiconductor manufacturing and assembly and test capacity over the last few years , and we continue to plan capacity based on the assumed continued success of our overall strategy and the acceptance of our products in specific market segments . we currently expect that capital spending will be between $ 3 . 6 billion and $ 3 . 7 billion in 2003 , down from $ 4 . 7 billion in 2002 . the reduction is primarily the result of expected improvements in capital efficiency , with an increase in effective manufacturing capacity as we transition to the larger , 300mm wafer manufacturing process , and the timing of manufacturing process technology cycles . this capital-spending plan is dependent on expectations regarding production efficiencies and delivery times of various machinery and equipment , and construction schedules for new facilities . if the demand for our products does not grow and continue to move toward higher performance products in the various market segments , revenue and gross margin would be adversely affected and manufacturing and / or assembly and test capacity would be under-utilized and the rate of capital spending could be further reduced . we could be required to record an impairment of our manufacturing or assembly and test equipment and / or facilities , or factory planning decisions may cause us to record accelerated depreciation . however , in the long term , revenue and gross margin may also be affected if we do not add capacity fast enough to meet market demand when economic conditions improve . Â   35 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   we expect depreciation expense to be approximately $ 1 . 2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2003 . Â   spending on research and development , plus marketing , general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2003 is expected to be between $ 2 . 2 billion and $ 2 . 3 billion , slightly higher than the third quarter . expenses , particularly certain marketing and compensation-related expenses , may vary from this expectation , depending in part on the level of revenue and profits . Â   research and development spending is expected to be approximately $ 4 . 3 billion in 2003 as compared to the previous expectation of $ 4 . 2 billion . Â   based on acquisitions completed through november 3 , 2003 , we expect amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs to be approximately $ 65 million in the fourth quarter . Â   we review our acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of potential impairment exist . we also review our goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year , or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist . if we fail to deliver new products for icg and wccg , if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance , or if market conditions in the communications businesses fail to improve , our revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and we may incur charges for impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets and goodwill . Â   we expect the net of losses from equity securities and interest and other for the fourth quarter of 2003 to be zero . this is primarily due to an expected net loss on equity securities and associated equity derivatives of approximately $ 35 million , primarily as a result of impairment charges on private equity investments , offset by expected net interest income . our expectations for impairment charges in the fourth quarter are based on our experience and it is not possible to know at the present time which specific investments are likely to be impaired or the extent or timing of individual impairments . in addition , our expectations for gains or losses from equity securities and interest and other assume no unanticipated events and vary depending on equity market levels and volatility , gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities , interest rates , cash balances , and changes in the fair value of derivative instruments . Â   at september 27 , 2003 , we held non-marketable equity securities with a carrying value of $ 538 million . our ability to recover our investments in non-marketable equity securities and to earn a return on these investments is primarily dependent on how successfully these companies are able to execute to their business plans and how their products are accepted , as well as their ability to obtain venture capital funding to continue operations and to grow . in the current equity market environment , their ability to obtain additional funding as well as to take advantage of liquidity events , such as initial public offerings , mergers and private sales , is significantly constrained . we have experienced substantial impairments in our portfolio of non-marketable equity securities as equity markets declined significantly over the past few years . if the level of ipo market activity does not increase and the availability of venture capital funding for technology investments does not improve , our non-marketable investments may be adversely affected . as companies within our portfolio attempt to raise additional funds , the funds may not be available to them or they may receive lower valuations , with more onerous investment terms than in previous financings , and our investments would likely become impaired . Â   we currently expect our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2003 to be approximately 31 . 5 % . the estimated effective tax rate is based on current tax law and the current expected income , may be affected by the closing of acquisitions or divestitures , the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed , and the ability to realize deferred tax assets , and assumes the company continues to receive the tax benefit for export sales ( see Â “ note 18 : contingencies Â ” in notes to consolidated condensed financial statements ) . Â   36 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   we are currently a party to various legal proceedings and claims , including claims related to taxes . management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations . however , litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur . an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages , additional taxes owed or , in cases where injunctive relief is sought , an injunction prohibiting intel from selling one or more products . if an unfavorable ruling were to occur in any specific period , there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations of that period or future periods . management believes that , given our current liquidity and cash and investment balances , even an adverse judgment would not have a material impact on cash and investments or liquidity . Â   we operate globally with sales offices and research and development activities as well as manufacturing and assembly and test in many countries ; and so we are subject to risks and factors associated with doing business outside the united states . global operations involve inherent risks that include currency controls and fluctuations , tariff and import regulations , and regulatory requirements which may limit our or our customers Â ’ ability to manufacture , assemble and test or sell products in particular countries . if terrorist activity , armed conflict , civil or military unrest or political instability occurs in the united states , israel or other locations , such events may disrupt logistics , security and communications , and could also result in reduced demand for intel Â ’ s products . the impacts of major health concerns , such as the sars illness , or large scale outages or interruptions of service from utility or other infrastructure providers on intel , its suppliers , customers or other third parties could also adversely affect our business and impact customer order patterns . we could also be affected if labor issues disrupt our transportation arrangements or those of our customers or suppliers . on a worldwide basis , we regularly review our key infrastructure , systems , services and suppliers both internally and externally , to seek to identify significant vulnerabilities as well as areas of potential business impact if a disruptive event were to occur . once identified , we assess the risks , and as we consider it to be appropriate , we initiate actions intended to minimize the risks and their potential impact . however , there can be no assurance that we have identified all significant risks or that we can mitigate all identified risks with reasonable effort . Â   our future results of operations and the other forward-looking statements contained in this Â “ outlook Â ” section , and in our Â “ strategy Â ” and Â “ critical accounting estimates Â ” sections , involve a number of risks and uncertainties Â — in particular the statements regarding our goals and strategies , new product introductions , plans to cultivate new businesses , market segment share and growth rate assumptions , future economic conditions and recovery in the communications businesses , revenue , pricing , gross margin and costs , capital spending , depreciation and amortization , research and development expenses , potential impairment of investments , the tax rate and pending legal proceedings . in addition to various factors that we have discussed above , a number of other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations . demand for our products , which impacts our revenue and gross margin percentage , is affected by business and economic conditions , as well as computing and communications industry trends and the development and timing of introduction of compelling software applications and operating systems that take advantage of the features of our products . demand for our products is also affected by changes in customer order patterns , such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by our customers and the timing of customer purchases . revenue and gross margin could also be affected by competitive factors , such as competing chip architectures and manufacturing technologies , competing software-compatible microprocessors , pricing pressures and other competitive factors , as well as market acceptance of new products in specific market segments , the availability of sufficient inventory to meet demand and availability of externally purchased components . our future revenue is also dependent on continuing technological advancement , including developing and implementing new processes and strategic products , as well as the timing of new product introductions , sustaining and growing new businesses and integrating and operating any acquired businesses . our results could also be affected by adverse effects associated with product defects and errata ( deviations from published specifications ) and by litigation involving intellectual property , stockholder , consumer and other issues . Â   we believe that we have the product offerings , facilities , personnel , and competitive and financial resources for continued business success , but future revenue , costs , margins and profits are all influenced by a number of factors , including those discussed above , all of which are inherently difficult to forecast . Â   37 management Â ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) Â   status of business outlook and scheduled business update Â   we expect that our corporate representatives will meet privately during the quarter with investors , investment analysts , the media and others , and may reiterate the business outlook published in this form 10-q . at the same time , we will keep this form 10-q and outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site ( www . intc . com Â   we intend to publish a mid-quarter business update on december 4 , 2003 . from the close of business on november 26 , 2003 until publication of the update , we will observe a Â “ quiet period Â ” during which the outlook and our filings with the sec on forms 10-k and 10-q should be considered historical , speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update . during the quiet period , our representatives will not comment on the outlook or our financial results or expectations . Â   a quiet period operating in similar fashion with regard to the outlook and our sec filings will begin at the close of business on december 12 , 2003 and will extend until the day when our next quarterly earnings release is published , presently scheduled for january 14 , 2004 .

conventional or developmental license , and affiliated ) to deliver a great customer experience and drive profitability . in most cases , franchising is the best way to achieve both goals . although direct restaurant operation is more capital-intensive relative to franchising and results in lower restaurant margins as a percent of revenues , company-operated restaurants are important to our success in both mature and developing markets . in our company-operated restaurants , and in collaboration with our franchisees , we further develop and refine operating standards , marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies , so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced systemwide . in addition , we firmly believe that owning restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and essential to providing company personnel with restaurant operations experience . our company-operated business also helps to facilitate changes in restaurant ownership as warranted by strategic considerations . revenues consist of sales by company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates . these fees primarily include rent and / or royalties that are based on a percent of sales , with specified minimum rent payments , along with initial fees . fees vary by type of site , amount of company investment and local business conditions . these fees , along with occupancy and operating rights , are stipulated in franchise / license agreements that generally have 20-year terms . the business is managed as distinct geographic segments . significant reportable segments include the united states ( u . s . ) , europe , and asia / pacific , middle east and africa ( apmea ) . in addition , throughout this report we present Â “ other countries Â   & corporate Â ” that includes operations in canada and latin america , as well as corporate activities . the u . s . and europe segments account for nearly 35 % and 45 % of total revenues , respectively . in second quarter 2008 , the company sold its minority ownership interest in u . k . -based pret a manger . in connection with the sale , the company received cash proceeds of $ 229 . 4 million and recognized a nonoperating gain of $ 160 . 1 million . in august 2007 , the company sold its investment in boston market and as a result , boston market Â ’ s results of operations have been reflected as discontinued operations . strategic direction and financial performance since implementing the customer-centered plan to win several years ago , the company remains focused on being better , not just bigger . our strategic alignment behind this plan has created better mcdonald Â ’ s experiences through the execution of multiple initiatives surrounding the five drivers of exceptional customer experiences Â — people , products , place , price and promotion . while our focus has remained the same , we have adapted our initiatives based on the changing needs and preferences of our customers . these multiple initiatives have increased our consumer relevance and contributed to sales and guest counts worldwide increasing every year since 2003 . in the second quarter 2008 , our strong results were driven by positive comparable sales and guest counts across all geographic segments . in the u . s . , the business continues to increase sales and guest counts through initiatives that provide value and variety to the consumer . the four key growth strategies of chicken , breakfast , beverages and convenience drove results with the nationwide launch of the southern style chicken biscuit and sandwich and locally relevant beverage promotions . in europe , an emphasis on delivering an improved customer experience along with unique marketing and signature menu options drove performance . double-digit operating income growth was fueled by a 7 . 4 % comparable sales increase . europe Â ’ s three strategies of strengthening local relevance , building greater brand transparency and upgrading the customer and employee experience continue to give customers even more reasons to visit mcdonald Â ’ s . in apmea , second quarter performance was strong , driven by positive comparable sales across the segment . our focus on everyday value , convenience and appealing product offerings are generating these strong results . Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   we remain committed to returning value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends . for 2007 through 2009 , the company expects to return $ 15 billion to $ 17 billion to shareholders , subject to business and market conditions . in the second quarter 2008 , we repurchased 13 . 3 Â   million shares of mcdonald Â ’ s stock for $ 787 . 9 million , bringing the total repurchases for the first six months of 2008 to 50 . 4 Â   million shares or $ 2 . 8 billion . during the second quarter 2008 , we paid a quarterly dividend of $ 0 . 375 per share or $ 421 . 6 million , bringing the total dividends paid for the first six months of 2008 to $ 848 . 0 million . for the full year 2007 and the first six months of 2008 combined , the company returned $ 9 . 4 billion to shareholders . Â   9 we also continue to enhance the mix of franchised and company-operated restaurants , including refranchising certain company-operated restaurants and executing our developmental license strategy , to maximize long-term brand performance and returns . the company expects to refranchise 1 , 000 to 1 , 500 company-operated restaurants by the end of 2010 , primarily in its major markets . in the first half of 2008 , the company refranchised about 300 restaurants . in august 2007 , the company completed the sale of its businesses in brazil , argentina , mexico , puerto rico , venezuela and 13 other countries in latin america and the caribbean to a developmental licensee organization . the company refers to these markets as Â “ latam . Â ” under the new ownership structure , the company receives only royalties in these markets instead of a combination of company-operated sales and franchised rents and royalties . operating highlights included : Â   Â   Â • Â   global comparable sales increased 6 . 1 % for the quarter and 6 . 7 % for the six months Â   Â   Â • Â   consolidated company-operated and franchised restaurant margins grew for the tenth consecutive quarter Â   Â   Â • Â   net income per share from continuing operations was $ 1 . 04 for the quarter , a 44 % increase ( 35 % in constant currencies ) and $ 1 . 85 for the six months , a 38 % increase ( 29 % in constant currencies ) , after adjusting for the impact of the 2007 latam transaction . the second quarter and six months 2008 net income includes a $ 0 . 10 per share gain from the previously announced sale of the company Â ’ s minority interest in pret a manger Â   Â   Â • Â   during the six months , the company repurchased $ 2 . 8 billion or 50 . 4 Â   million shares of its stock and paid quarterly dividends totaling $ 848 million Â   Â   Â • Â   cash provided by operations increased $ 730 million to $ 2 . 7 billion for the first six months outlook while the company does not provide specific guidance on net income per share , the following information is provided to assist in forecasting the company Â ’ s future results . Â   Â   Â • Â   changes in systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion . the company expects net restaurant additions to add slightly more than 1 percentage point to 2008 systemwide sales growth ( in constant currencies ) , most of which will be due to the 503 net traditional restaurants added in 2007 . Â   Â   Â • Â   the company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales . however , as a perspective , assuming no change in cost structure , a 1 percentage point increase in u . s . comparable sales would increase annual net income per share by about 2 . 5 cents . similarly , an increase of 1 percentage point in europe Â ’ s comparable sales would increase annual net income per share by about 2 . 5 cents . Â   Â   Â • Â   in 2008 , u . s . beef costs are expected to be up 8 % to 9 % and chicken costs are expected to rise about 5 % to 6 % . in europe , beef costs are expected to be up 8 % to 9 % , while chicken costs are expected to increase approximately 7 % to 8 % . some volatility may be experienced between quarters in the normal course of business . Â   Â   Â • Â   the company expects full-year 2008 selling , general Â   & administrative expenses to decline , in constant currencies , although fluctuations may be experienced between the quarters due to items such as the 2008 biennial worldwide owner / operator convention , the 2008 beijing summer olympics and the august 2007 sale of the company Â ’ s businesses in latam . Â   Â   Â • Â   based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates , the company expects interest expense in 2008 to increase approximately 35 % compared with 2007 , while 2008 interest income is expected to decrease about 30 % compared with 2007 . in 2008 , the company issued certain debt earlier than originally expected to take advantage of favorable market conditions to pre-fund a portion of its debt maturing in the second half of the year . Â   Â   Â • Â   a significant part of the company Â ’ s operating income is generated outside the u . s . , and about 50 % of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies . accordingly , earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates , particularly the euro and the british pound . if the euro and the british pound both move 10 % in the same direction compared with 2007 , the company Â ’ s annual net income per share would change by about 8 cents to 9 cents . Â   Â   Â • Â   the company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2008 to be approximately 29 % to 31 % , although some volatility may be experienced between the quarters in the normal course of business . Â   Â   Â • Â   the company expects capital expenditures for 2008 to be approximately $ 2 billion . about half of this amount will be reinvested in existing restaurants while the rest will primarily be used to open 1 , 000 restaurants ( 950 traditional and 50 satellites ) . the company expects net additions of about 600 restaurants ( 700 net traditional additions and 100 net satellite closings ) . these restaurant numbers include new unit openings in affiliate and developmental license markets , such as japan and those in latin america , where the company invests no capital . Â   10 Â   Â • Â   for 2007 through 2009 , the company expects to return $ 15 billion to $ 17 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends , subject to business and market conditions . for the full year 2007 and first half of 2008 combined , the company returned $ 9 . 4 billion to shareholders . Â   Â   Â • Â   the company continually reviews its restaurant ownership structures to maximize cash flow and returns and to enhance local relevance . the company expects to optimize its restaurant ownership mix by refranchising 1 , 000 to 1 , 500 company-operated restaurants by the end of 2010 , primarily in its major markets , and by continuing to utilize its developmental license strategy . in the first half of 2008 , the company refranchised about 300 restaurants . the following definitions apply to these terms as used throughout this form 10-q : Â   Â   Â • Â   constant currency Â   Â   Â • Â   systemwide sales Â   Â   Â • Â   comparable sales Â   11 Â   consolidated operating results Â   Â   dollars in millions , except per share data Â   Â   quarter endedjune Â   30 , 2008 Â   Â   six months endedjune Â   30 , 2008 Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   amount Â   Â   % Â   increase Â   / ( decrease ) Â   Â   amount Â   Â   % Â   increase Â   / ( decrease ) Â   revenues Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   sales by company-operated restaurants Â   Â   $ 4 , 296 . 0 Â   Â   ( 1 ) Â   $ 8 , 294 . 8 Â   Â   1 Â   revenues from franchised and affiliated restaurants Â   Â   Â   1 , 779 . 3 Â   Â   17 Â   Â   Â   3 , 395 . 3 Â   Â   17 Â   total revenues Â   Â   Â   6 , 075 . 3 Â   Â   4 Â   Â   Â   11 , 690 . 1 Â   Â   5 Â   operating costs and expenses Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   company-operated restaurant expenses Â   Â   Â   3 , 535 . 2 Â   Â   ( 1 ) Â   Â   6 , 874 . 8 Â   Â   Â — Â   Â   Â   franchised restaurants Â – occupancy expenses Â   Â   Â   315 . 3 Â   Â   12 Â   Â   Â   615 . 1 Â   Â   10 Â   selling , general Â   & administrative expenses Â   Â   Â   598 . 7 Â   Â   1 Â   Â   Â   1 , 151 . 1 Â   Â   1 Â   impairment and other charges , net Â   Â   Â   0 . 5 Â   Â   n / m Â   Â   Â   1 . 0 Â   Â   n / m Â   other operating ( income ) expense , net Â   Â   Â   ( 28 . 6 ) Â   ( 31 ) Â   Â   ( 68 . 9 ) Â   n / m Â   total operating costs and expenses Â   Â   Â   4 , 421 . 1 Â   Â   ( 27 ) Â   Â   8 , 573 . 1 Â   Â   ( 15 ) operating income Â   Â   Â   1 , 654 . 2 Â   Â   n / m Â   Â   Â   3 , 117 . 0 Â   Â   n / m Â   interest expense Â   Â   Â   146 . 3 Â   Â   44 Â   Â   Â   274 . 8 Â   Â   38 Â   nonoperating ( income ) expense , net Â   Â   Â   ( 30 . 8 ) Â   ( 82 ) Â   Â   ( 59 . 7 ) Â   ( 78 ) gain on sale of investment Â   Â   Â   ( 160 . 1 ) Â   n / m Â   Â   Â   ( 160 . 1 ) Â   n / m Â   income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes Â   Â   Â   1 , 698 . 8 Â   Â   n / m Â   Â   Â   3 , 062 . 0 Â   Â   n / m Â   provision for income taxes Â   Â   Â   508 . 3 Â   Â   15 Â   Â   Â   925 . 4 Â   Â   19 Â   income from continuing operations Â   Â   Â   1 , 190 . 5 Â   Â   n / m Â   Â   Â   2 , 136 . 6 Â   Â   n / m Â   income from discontinued operations Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   n / m Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   n / m Â   net income Â   Â   $ 1 , 190 . 5 Â   Â   n / m Â   Â   $ 2 , 136 . 6 Â   Â   n / m Â   income per common share Â – basic : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   continuing operations Â   Â   $ 1 . 05 Â   Â   n / m Â   Â   $ 1 . 88 Â   Â   n / m Â   discontinued operations Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   n / m Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   n / m Â   net income Â   Â   $ 1 . 05 Â   Â   n / m Â   Â   $ 1 . 88 Â   Â   n / m Â   income per common share Â – diluted : Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   continuing operations Â   Â   $ 1 . 04 Â   Â   n / m Â   Â   $ 1 . 85 Â   Â   n / m Â   discontinued operations Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   n / m Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   n / m Â   net income Â   Â   $ 1 . 04 Â   Â   n / m Â   Â   $ 1 . 85 Â   Â   n / m Â   n / m not meaningful in addition to the reported consolidated operating results for the quarter and six months ended june Â   30 , 2007 , consolidated results for these periods are presented throughout this report excluding the impact of the latam transaction . management believes the latam transaction and the associated charge are not indicative of ongoing operations due to the size and scope of the transaction . management believes that the adjusted results better reflect the underlying business trends relevant to the periods presented .

Â   21 discontinued operations in august 2007 , the company sold its investment in boston market and as a result , boston market Â ’ s results of operations have been reflected in discontinued operations . boston market Â ’ s net loss for the second quarter and six months 2007 was $ 3 . 3 million and $ 7 . 4 million , respectively . cash flows and financial position the company generates significant cash from operations and has substantial credit capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures , debt repayments , dividends and share repurchases . cash provided by operations totaled $ 2 . 7 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $ 1 . 9 billion for the six months 2008 . cash provided by operations increased $ 729 . 8 million compared to the six months 2007 driven by strong operating results and changes in working capital items , partly due to the receipt of $ 142 . 7 Â   million related to the internal revenue service ( irs ) examination completed in fourth quarter 2007 . cash used for investing activities totaled $ 491 . 9 million for the six months 2008 , a decrease of $ 359 . 1 million , primarily due to proceeds from the sale of our investment in pret a manger in the second quarter 2008 , higher proceeds from sales of restaurant businesses in conjunction with our overall refranchising strategy and lower purchases of restaurant businesses . capital expenditures increased $ 64 . 8 million for the six months , primarily driven by an increase in europe and the impact of stronger foreign currencies , partly offset by the elimination of capital expenditures as a result of the latam transaction . cash used for financing activities totaled $ 2 . 0 billion for the six months , an increase of $ 757 . 7 million . financing activities in 2008 reflected higher treasury stock purchases and dividend payments and lower proceeds from stock option exercises , partly offset by higher net debt issuances . as previously announced , the company Â ’ s board of directors decided that beginning in 2008 dividends declared will be paid on a quarterly basis , at the board Â ’ s discretion . debt obligations at june Â   30 , 2008 totaled $ 11 . 1 billion compared with $ 9 . 3 billion at december Â   31 , 2007 . the increase in 2008 was primarily due to net issuances of $ 1 . 5 billion . return on average assets return on average assets for the trailing 12 month period ended june Â   30 , 2008 was 19 . 9 % compared to 13 . 2 % for the full year 2007 . return on average assets is computed as operating income for the most recent four quarters divided by average assets based on month-end balances . operating income , as reported , does not include interest income ; however , cash balances are included in average assets . the inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by 2 . 1 percentage points and 1 . 3 percentage points in 2008 and 2007 , respectively . impairment and other charges ( credits ) , net had a minimal impact on return on average assets in 2008 and reduced return on average assets by 5 . 4 percentage points in 2007 . in 2008 , return on average assets benefited from strong operating results in europe and apmea . the company will continue to concentrate restaurant openings and new capital invested in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for long-term growth . accounting changes fair value measurements in september 2006 , the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) issued statement of financial accounting standards no . Â   157 , fair value measurements ( sfas no . Â   157 ) . sfas no . Â   157 defines fair value , establishes a framework for measuring fair value , and expands disclosures about fair value measurements . this statement does not require any new fair value measurements ; rather , it applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements . the provisions of sfas no .

Â   157risk factors and cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements this report includes forward-looking statements about our plans and future performance , including those under outlook . these statements use such words as Â “ may , Â ” Â “ will , Â ” Â “ expect , Â ” Â “ believe Â ” and Â “ plan . Â ” they reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report . we do not undertake to update them . our expectations ( or the underlying assumptions ) may change or not be realized , and you should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements . Â   22 our business and execution of our strategic plan , the plan to win , are subject to risks . by far the most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our customers and a brand they trust . meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our operating environment . the informal eating out segment of the restaurant industry , although largely mature in our major markets , is also highly fragmented and competitive . we have the added challenge of the cultural , economic and regulatory differences that exist among the more than 100 countries where we operate . we also face risk in adapting our business model in particular markets . the decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise , developmental license or joint venture agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex and changing . regulatory and similar initiatives around the world have also become more wide-ranging and prescriptive and affect how we operate and our results . in particular , increasing focus on nutritional content and on the production , processing and preparation of food Â “ from field to front counter Â ” presents challenges for our brand and may adversely affect our results . these risks can have an impact both in the near- and long-term and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe are most likely to affect our performance . our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales depends largely on how well we execute the plan to win . the plan to win addresses the key drivers of our business and results Â — people , products , place , price and promotion . the quality of our execution depends mainly on the following : Â   Â   Â • Â   our ability to anticipate and respond to trends or other factors that affect the informal eating out market and our competitive position in the diverse markets we serve , such as spending patterns , demographic changes , trends in food preparation , consumer preferences and publicity about our products , all of which can drive consumer perceptions or affect the willingness of other companies to enter into site , supply or other arrangements or alliances with us , as well as our success in addressing these trends and factors or other competitive pressures ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the success of our initiatives to support menu choice , physical activity and nutritional awareness and to address these and other matters of social responsibility in a way that communicates our values effectively and inspires the trust and confidence of our customers ; Â   Â   Â • Â   our ability to respond effectively to adverse consumer perceptions about the quick-service segment of the informal eating out market , our products and promotions ( including the premiums we offer , such as our happy meal toys ) or the reliability of our supply chain and the safety of the ingredients we use , and our ability to manage the potential impact on mcdonald Â ’ s of food-borne illnesses or product safety issues ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the success of our plans to improve existing products and to roll-out new products and product line extensions , as well as the impact of our competitors Â ’ actions , including in response to our product improvements and introductions , and our ability to continue robust product development and manage the complexity of our restaurant operations ; Â   Â   Â • Â   our ability to achieve an overall product mix that differentiates the mcdonald Â ’ s experience and balances consumer value with margin expansion , including in markets where cost or pricing pressures may be significant ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the impact of pricing , marketing and promotional plans on product sales and margins and on our ability to target these efforts effectively to maintain or expand market share ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the impact of events such as consumer boycotts or protests , labor strikes and supply chain interruptions ( including due to lack of supply or price increases ) that can adversely affect us directly or adversely affect the vendors , franchisees and others that are also part of the mcdonald Â ’ s system and whose performance has a material impact on our results ; Â   Â   Â • Â   our ability to recruit and retain qualified local personnel to manage our operations and growth in certain developing markets ; Â   Â   Â • Â   our ability to drive restaurant improvements and to motivate our restaurant personnel to achieve sustained high service levels so as to improve consumer perceptions of our ability to meet expectations for quality food served in clean and friendly environments ; Â   Â   Â • Â   our ability to maintain alignment with our franchisees on capital-intensive and other operating and promotional initiatives ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the risks to our brand if a franchisee or licensee defaults in its obligations ( particularly requirements to pay royalties , make capital investments and open new restaurants ) , experiences food safety or other operational problems or otherwise projects a brand image inconsistent with our values , all of which become more significant risks if an agreement places a large number of restaurants under the control of a single franchisee or licensee as is the case in latin america ; Â   Â   Â • Â   whether our ongoing restaurant remodeling and rebuilding initiatives , which vary from year to year by market and type , are targeted at the elements of the restaurant experience that will best accomplish our goals to enhance the relevance of our brand and achieve an efficient allocation of our capital resources ; and Â   23 Â   Â • Â   our ability to leverage promotional or operating successes in individual markets into other markets in a timely and cost-effective way . our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions , which can adversely affect our sales , margins and net income . our results of operations are substantially affected not only by global economic conditions , but also by local operating and economic conditions , which can vary substantially by market . unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market and may prompt promotional or other actions that adversely affect our margins , constrain our operating flexibility or result in charges , restaurant closings or sales of company-operated restaurants . whether we can manage this risk effectively depends mainly on the following : Â   Â   Â • Â   our ability to manage upward pressure on commodity prices , as well as fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates and local governmental actions to manage national economic conditions , such as consumer spending , inflation rates and unemployment levels , particularly in the united states , which continues to face an uncertain economy ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the impact on our margins of labor costs given our labor-intensive business model , the trend toward higher wages in both mature and developing markets and the potential impact of union organizing efforts on day-to-day operations of our restaurants ; Â   Â   Â • Â   whether we are able to identify and develop restaurant sites , either directly or through licensees or other parties , consistent with our plans for net growth of systemwide restaurants from year to year , and whether new sites are as profitable as expected ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the challenges and uncertainties associated with operating in developing markets , such as china , russia and india , which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability , economic volatility , crime , corruption and social and ethnic unrest , all of which are exacerbated in many cases by a lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainties in how local law is applied and enforced , including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment ; and Â   Â   Â • Â   the nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets , including decisions that result in impairment charges that reduce our earnings , such as those that may occur as we change our ownership mix as described above . our results and financial condition are affected by our ownership mix and whether we can achieve a mix that optimizes margins and returns , while meeting our business needs and customer expectations . in recent years , we have reduced the number of company-operated restaurants and we are planning further reductions by franchising company-operated restaurants or entering into developmental license agreements . whether and when we can achieve these plans , as well as their success , is uncertain and will be affected by the following : Â   Â   Â • Â   our ability to identify prospective franchisees and licensees with the experience and financial resources in the relevant markets to be effective operators of mcdonald Â ’ s restaurants and how quickly we can reach agreement with our counterparties , which we expect will vary by market and could also vary significantly from period to period ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the nature and amount of contingent liabilities and other exposures we may retain in connection with developmental license agreements , such as the indemnification obligations we may incur as a result of the latam transaction ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the risk that our contractual and other rights and remedies to protect against defaults by our counterparties will be limited by local law , costly to exercise or otherwise subject to limitations or litigation that may impair our ability to prevent or mitigate any adverse impact on our brand or on the financial performance we expect under our franchising and developmental license agreements ; and Â   Â   Â • Â   changes in the operating or legal environment and other circumstances that cause us to delay or revise our plans to alter our ownership mix . increasing regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways . our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance , litigation and similar risks that affect our operations and results in material ways . in many of our markets , including the united states and europe , we are subject to increasing regulation , which has increased our cost of doing business . in developing markets , we face the risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems . among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face and must manage are the following : Â   Â   Â • Â   the cost , compliance and other risks associated with the often conflicting regulations we face , especially in the united states where inconsistent standards imposed by local , state and federal authorities can adversely affect consumer perceptions and increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings , and the impact of new , potential or changing regulation that affects or restricts elements of our business , particularly those relating to advertising to children , nutritional content and product labeling and safety ; Â   24 Â   Â • Â   the impact of nutritional , health and other scientific inquiries and conclusions , which constantly evolve and often have contradictory implications , but nonetheless drive consumer perceptions , litigation and regulation in ways that could be material to our business ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the risks and costs of mcdonald Â ’ s nutritional labeling and other disclosure practices , particularly given differences among applicable legal requirements and laws and among practices within the restaurant industry with respect to testing and disclosure , ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants , and reliance on the accuracy and completeness of information obtained from third party suppliers ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the impact of litigation trends , particularly in our major markets , including class actions , labor and employment matters and landlord / tenant disputes , the relative level of our defense costs , which vary from period to period depending on the number , nature and procedural status of pending proceedings ; and the cost and other effects of settlements or judgments , which may require us to make disclosures or take other actions that may affect perceptions of our brand and products ; Â   Â   Â • Â   adverse results of pending or future litigation , including litigation challenging the composition of our products or the appropriateness or accuracy of our advertising or other communications ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the increasing costs and other effects of compliance with existing and possible future u . s . federal , state and local regulations regarding immigration and evolving enforcement standards under those regulations , as well as compliance with other u . s . and overseas labor regulations , including with respect to wage and hour matters , employee classification , mandatory healthcare benefits and unlawful workplace discrimination ; Â   Â   Â • Â   disruptions in our operations or price volatility in a market that can result from governmental actions , such as price or import-export controls or government-mandated closure of our or our vendors Â ’ operations , and the cost and disruption of responding to government investigations , whether or not they have merit or are undertaken to achieve political impact ; Â   Â   Â • Â   the risks associated with information security and the use of cashless payments , such as increased investment in technology , the costs of compliance with privacy , consumer protection and other laws , the impact on our margins as the use of cashless payments increases , the potential costs associated with alleged security breaches and the loss of consumer confidence that may result ; and Â   Â   Â • Â   the impact of changes in financial reporting requirements , accounting principles or practices , related legal or regulatory interpretations or our critical accounting estimates , changes in tax accounting or tax laws ( or interpretations thereof ) , and the impact of settlements of adjustments proposed by the irs in connection with our tax audits , all of which will depend on their timing , nature and scope . the trading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many factors . many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects . the most important of these , some of which are outside our control , are the following : Â   Â   Â • Â   governmental actions or media reports and commentary relating to economic activity or events , such as the current u . s . presidential election , even where the action , report or event does not directly relate to our business or prospects , and particularly actions by u . s . authorities or u . s . economic activity , which are of special import because the united states is the principal trading market for our common stock ; Â   Â   Â • Â   trading activity in our common stock ( whether in the cash or derivative markets ) , which can reflect not only market commentary or expectations about our business , but also significant purchases by shareholders who may seek to affect our business strategies , or trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which mcdonald Â ’ s may be included , such as the s & p 500 index and the dow jones industrial average ; and Â   Â   Â • Â   the impact of our stock repurchase program , dividend rate or changes in our debt levels that may affect our credit ratings , interest expense , ability to obtain funding on favorable terms or our flexibility , especially if lenders impose new operating or financial covenants , as well as the impact of other corporate actions , such as initiatives to rationalize our operating structure . our results can be adversely affected by disruptions or events , such as the impact of severe weather conditions and natural disasters . severe weather conditions , terrorist activities , health epidemics or pandemics or the prospect of these events can have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels or on other factors that affect our results and prospects , such as commodity costs . our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to certain of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully .
